      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of Conformal or Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy when given in combination with&#xD;
      gefitinib 250mg in Chinese patients with IIIB or IV NSCLC after failure of platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to obtain the preliminary information on efficacy after&#xD;
      concomitant treatment of gefitinib 250mg and radiotherapy in Chinese patients with IIIB or IV&#xD;
      NSCLC after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy, as measured by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the pattern of failure (e.g., local, regional, or distant metastasis) in&#xD;
      patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laboratory research has suggested that targeting specific signalling proteins would be well&#xD;
      suited for selectively enhancing the tumor radiosensitivity. In human xenograft models&#xD;
      (non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer) treated with gefitinib and irradiation,&#xD;
      combined therapy has shown a significant increase in tumor growth delay as compared with&#xD;
      monotherapy of irradiation or gefitinib. The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor ZD1839 selectively potentiates radiation response of human tumors in nude mice,&#xD;
      with a marked improvement in therapeutic index. The authors concluded that gefitinib&#xD;
      profoundly enhanced the antitumor action of RT against the tested tumors without significant&#xD;
      adverse effects, increasing the therapeutic selectively of ionizing radiation in certain&#xD;
      model systems. Substantial benefits for this multimodality therapy in patients could be&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are no published data on the feasibility and efficacy of combined gefitinib and&#xD;
      radiation therapy in Chinese population who might be susceptible to gefitinib monotherapy,&#xD;
      clinical studies have demonstrated that combining gefitinib with external beam radiation to&#xD;
      66-74Gy and concurrent weekly chemotherapy after induction chemotherapy were tolerated&#xD;
      without excessive toxicity. In the present trail, we hope to build on our own experience of&#xD;
      using combined gefitinib and thoracic radiation with 3D-CRT or intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy (IMRT) technique in a phase I setting for stage IIIb and selected stage IV&#xD;
      NSCLC. We will follow this treatment (RT and gefitinib) with 60 days gefitinib at standard&#xD;
      systemic doses.&#xD;

    <description>Thoracic RT for patients will start from 54Gy, and then escalate dose at 2Gy increment to 60Gy. At each dose level, 8 patients are required to complete RT without dose limiting toxicity(DLT). Evaluation will be done after 8 patients have completed the treatment.If there are &gt;=2 DLT in the first 8 patients, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved. If there is a single DLT revealed, an additional 8 patients will be recruited to that dose level. Should there be severe complication occurred again be at least 1 more DLT, then MTD is thought to be achieved.Hence,MTD will be achieved if at least 2 out of the first 8 patients have a DLT,or if a further 8 patents are recruited, &gt;=2 out of 16 patients have a DLT. Concurrent with RT, patients will be given gefitinib 250 mg/day PO as well as same dose PO for 60 days after the completion of RT.</description>
