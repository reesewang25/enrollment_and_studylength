  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective chart review of patient records at the University of Mississippi&#xD;
      Medical Center. We are not actively recruiting patients for this study. Recent animal studies&#xD;
      we conducted showed that periapical abscesses during pregnancy cause a systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response in the mother. Also due to the increase in TNF-alpha (an inflammatory cytokine) the&#xD;
      mother also become insulin resistant and thus developed gestational diabetes. Periodontal&#xD;
      inflammation has been shown in the research to lead to low-birth weight and pre-term birth.&#xD;
      We are looking retrospectively to see if an association exists in charted data between&#xD;
      periapical and periodontal inflammation and adverse pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

      A. Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine possible associations between periapical oral infection and adverse&#xD;
           pregnancy outcomes in female patients in the School of Dentistry, the Dental/Dental&#xD;
           Emergent Care Clinic (Jackson Medical Mall), and the UMC Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effects of several confounding variables related to stress from pain from&#xD;
           the periapical infections on these adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past five years there has been increasing evidence for associations between&#xD;
      periodontal infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans, including preterm birth, low&#xD;
      birth-weight babies, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, and preeclampsia. These events likely&#xD;
      result from oral infections because bacteremia and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from&#xD;
      the diseased oral sites have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to be harmful and destructive to a successful&#xD;
      pregnancy. The adverse fetal inflammatory response to TNF-alpha, IL-6 and C-reactive protein&#xD;
      has been associated with preterm birth. These cytokines are also commonly associated with&#xD;
      oral infections, both periodontal and periapical11. In addition, oral infections often&#xD;
      produce pain and stress, which are considered harmful to a successful pregnancy. Since the&#xD;
      effects of periodontal infections on adverse pregnancy outcomes have been described, it would&#xD;
      be worthwhile to examine the specific effects of oral periapical abscesses on adverse birth&#xD;
      outcomes, to begin to determine whether there is an association between this type of oral&#xD;
      infection and these adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no published information concerning the possible associations of tooth abscesses on&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes. In addition, there is no known biological mechanism for the direct link&#xD;
      between periodontal infections, pre-term birth and low birth-weight babies. Secondary factors&#xD;
      such as age, race, and life-style likely confound assessment of these associations. There are&#xD;
      some preliminary studies of these variables in regard to the association between periodontal&#xD;
      infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes, but not for periapical lesions. Since periapical&#xD;
      lesions produce pain, these secondary factors could be more important to pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
      than the primary factors (bacteria and proinflammatory cytokines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Data collection. Archived dental records from female patients treated during the past&#xD;
      three years at the University of Mississippi School of Dentistry and the Dental/Dental&#xD;
      Emergent Care Clinic (Jackson Medical Mall) will be examined. Each patient record will be&#xD;
      assigned a study number, and data will be entered on an Excel spreadsheet using that study&#xD;
      number. Since the pregnancy outcome is part of the UMC Hospital record, the principal&#xD;
      investigator will link the dental and hospital records using the patient name. However, the&#xD;
      data collected will use a research number. Following the procedure for linking the patient&#xD;
      records, the patient name will be discarded. Thus, it will not be possible to link an&#xD;
      individual patient to the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be recorded: age, pregnancy status, number of pulpal&#xD;
      abscesses, number of sites of periodontitis (pocket depth â‰¥ 4 mm), race, highest level of&#xD;
      education, DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth), number of children, past pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and any other known pregnancy related conditions&#xD;
      experienced during previous pregnancies from the records of the Dental/Emergent Dental Care&#xD;
      Clinic. We will define adverse pregnancy outcomes as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia,&#xD;
      pre-term birth, and a low-birthweight infant from the UMC hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Statistical Analysis of data. The data will be analyzed using SPSS v12 using appropriate&#xD;
      statistical tests, including factorial ANOVA with post hoc tests, multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression, the Spearman correlation test, and chi square analysis.&#xD;

        We are looking at charts of patients (former patients) at the University of Mississippi&#xD;
        School of Dentistry. Since this is a pregnancy study we are looking only at the charts of&#xD;
        female patients. The youngest record we review is 10 and there is no upper limit to the&#xD;
        age.&#xD;
