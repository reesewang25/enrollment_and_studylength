      A prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial is proposed to compare Stryker Orthopaedics&#xD;
      N2Vac Polyethylene to their X3 Polyethylene when used with the Triathlon Posterior Stabilized&#xD;
      (PS) total knee system.&#xD;

      This is a fixed-bearing knee intended for use in patients undergoing cemented total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty. The devices to be used are both FDA approved via 510k clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 572 cases (286 per group) will be entered. Each patient will be assessed&#xD;
      pre-operatively and post-operatively at three months and two, five, seven and ten years. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the revision rate at ten years. The result for these will be&#xD;
      analyzed using an unconditional test of equivalence between two independent binomials.&#xD;
      Chi-square analysis will be used to compare the instance of mortality, revision surgery, deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, neurovascular complication, and infection. Other outcome&#xD;
      measures incorporated in the Knee Society Clinical rating scale will undergo appropriate&#xD;
      generalized linear regression for the type of outcome involved. The primary aim of the study&#xD;
      is to compare the survivorship of two types of polyethylene (conventional N2Vac and highly&#xD;
      cross-linked X3) used in a fixed-bearing total knee system in patients undergoing cemented&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty. These results will be measured through radiographs at each&#xD;
      post-operative interval with an independent radiograph review being performed after all&#xD;
      patients have reached 7 and 10 year follow-up. Secondary results will also be collected and&#xD;
      will focus on disease-specific (Knee Society Scores), global (SF-12 v1), and outcome&#xD;
      measures. Radiographic results consisting of standing anteroposterior, lateral and Merchant&#xD;
      views of the surgical knee will be recorded and analyzed. Completion of the initial&#xD;
      investigation will occur at the 10-year interval after the last enrolled.&#xD;
