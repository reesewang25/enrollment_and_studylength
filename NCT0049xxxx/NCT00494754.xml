      The purpose of this study is to prepare instruments for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), to&#xD;
      collect clinical, neuropsychological, and genetic data of ASD probands and their family, and&#xD;
      to identify the genetic variants close to etiological genes of ASD in a Taiwanese sample&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent reciprocal social and&#xD;
      communication impairment and restricted repetitive behavior or interest. Based on the number&#xD;
      of symptoms and functional impairment, autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, and atypical&#xD;
      autism (or PDDNOS) are conceptualized as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most recent&#xD;
      survey estimated the prevalence of narrow diagnosis of autistic disorder to be around 0.1% to&#xD;
      0.2%, and 0.59 % to 0.63% for ASD, with a four-fold male predominance. Due to high&#xD;
      heritability (&gt; 0.9), high family recurrence risk (Î» = 60), and severe impairment without&#xD;
      effective prevention and treatment available for ASD, this disastrous disease has been&#xD;
      prioritized for molecular genetic study from public health perspective. The proposed research&#xD;
      is the first systematic approach combining clinical and molecular genetic study of ASD&#xD;
      involving multi-sites and three research cores: assessment core (by Gau SS and Wu YY),&#xD;
      molecular genetics core (by Chen CH), and data/statistics core (by Gau SS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective of this study is to establish clinical and genetic database of autism&#xD;
      and their family for etiology study, exploration of pathogenesis, and developing new&#xD;
      treatment. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to establish the psychometric properties of three Chinese versions of rating scales for&#xD;
           ASD: SCQ, SRS, and ABC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to collect clinical, neuropsychological, and genetic data of ASD probands and their&#xD;
           family and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to identify the genetic variants close to etiological genes of ASD in a Taiwanese sample&#xD;
           using candidate gene case-control association study design (e.g., Neuroligin gene&#xD;
           family, MeCP2 gene, and FOXP2 gene, parent trio and population-based studies) and whole&#xD;
           genome linkage analysis for multiplex families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After well-preparation of instruments, DNA collection procedure, and assessor's training in&#xD;
      the first 6 months, we will recruit 40, 170, and 90 ASD families in the first, second, and&#xD;
      third year of the project, respectively. The instruments include the ADI-R, ADOS, K-SADS-E,&#xD;
      SCQ, SRS, and ABC for measuring autistic psychopathology; WISC-III, MSEL and PPVT for&#xD;
      cognitive ability; CPT, CANTAB, and WCST for neuropsychological functioning, and MRI, MRS,&#xD;
      and DSI for brain imaging study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate the establishment of the database of 300 ASD families, completion of the&#xD;
      mutation screening of several candidate genes, and determination of their association with&#xD;
      ASD and its intermediate phenotype in our sample. The identification of susceptible genes for&#xD;
      ASD would be a major breakthrough in child psychiatry because this revelation would&#xD;
      facilitate the scientific diagnosis of autism and as a result, it would shed light on the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of autism and contribute to the development of the novel, specific and effective&#xD;
      treatment of this devastating disease.&#xD;
