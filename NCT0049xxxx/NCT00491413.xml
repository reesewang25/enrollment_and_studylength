  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythropoietin (Epo) is a hormone normally found in the body that may protect brain cells&#xD;
      from damage due to lack of oxygen. This study will evaluate the safety of high-dose Epo in&#xD;
      infants who did not get enough oxygen during birth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Damage to the central nervous system as a result of oxygen deprivation at birth is a major&#xD;
      cause of life-long mental and developmental handicaps. When there is not enough oxygen in the&#xD;
      blood (hypoxemia) the brain is deprived of oxygen. Some brain cells respond by producing Epo.&#xD;
      Epo then binds to oxygen-deprived brain cells. This binding triggers chemical reactions&#xD;
      within the brain cell that prevent cell death. Epo also reduces inflammation around the brain&#xD;
      cells and acts as an antioxidant. In animal studies, recombinant Epo (rEpo) administration,&#xD;
      even up to six hours after oxygen deprivation, reduced subsequent brain injury by 50% to 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epo has been used by neonatologists to stimulate erythropoiesis (red blood cell production)&#xD;
      and reduce the incidence of blood transfusions. Doses of rEpo required for protection of&#xD;
      brain cells are considerably higher than those traditionally used by neonatologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biologic effect, and safety of high dose Epo&#xD;
      in neonates with brain injury due to hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within six hours of birth, each eligible infant will receive one dose of rEpo intravenously.&#xD;
      Any infants who require a lumbar puncture during the first week of life will have levels of&#xD;
      natural Epo and rEpo in their spinal fluid measured. Blood tests will be used to measure the&#xD;
      antioxidant effect of Epo and the impact on red blood cell production. Neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcome will be measured at 6 and 12 months of age.&#xD;
