      Introduction: Aldosterone seems to have deleterious effects on the kidneys. Many animal&#xD;
      studies and few clinical trials now have shown that suppression of aldosterone by aldosterone&#xD;
      receptor blockers ameliorated these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: In a double-blind, cross over study, 24 patients with diabetic nephropathy who were&#xD;
      already receiving either ACE inhibitor(lisinopril 20-40 mg/day ) or ARB( losartan 25-100&#xD;
      mg/day )were given spironolactone( 25 mg during the first month and 50 mg during the second&#xD;
      and third month if serum K remained ok) or matching placebo with 1 month of washout in&#xD;
      between. All patients were from a single center and exclusively male veterans. Blood&#xD;
      pressure, serum creatinine, serum K and spot urine protein/creatinine were measured at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of each study period. The study was started in May of 2003 and completed in&#xD;
      May 2006.&#xD;

      Spironolactone for reducing proteinuria and progression of renal failure in diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of ESRD in USA now and accounts for 40% of all new&#xD;
      patients that begins renal replacement therapy each year. The number of new patients starting&#xD;
      chronic dialysis therapy is 70,000 each year and is increasing. This number does not include&#xD;
      patients who decline dialysis therapy or die soon after starting dialysis. The economic and&#xD;
      human cost of diabetic nephropathy is therefore enormous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggressive control of blood pressure especially with ACE-inhibitor had been shown to reduce&#xD;
      proteinuria and progression of renal dysfunction in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics. Use of&#xD;
      ACE-inhibitor reduced proteinuria even in normotensive diabetics with microalbuminuria.&#xD;
      However even with optimal use of ACE-Inhibitor the progression of renal dysfunction is not&#xD;
      completely stopped. Other additional treatment strategies therefore need to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animals and small pilot studies in humans have shown that nondihydropyridine&#xD;
      calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem or verapamil) may have additional protective effect&#xD;
      in reducing proteinuria when used in conjunction with ACE-inhibitor. Use of angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers along with ACE-inhibitors also had been tried but results are not&#xD;
      dependable because of the short sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While angiotensin plays the major role in glomerular hemodynamics there is increasing&#xD;
      evidence that aldosterone plays a significant role in renal hemodynamics independent of&#xD;
      angiotensin. In a remnant kidney model in the rat Greene et al showed that there was greater&#xD;
      than 10-fold rise in aldosterone in the remnant kidney rats (REM) compared to SHAM operated&#xD;
      ones. As expected, the proteinuria, hypertension and glomerulosclerosis in the REM rats were&#xD;
      attenuated with treatment with ACE-inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockers (REM AIIA).&#xD;
      However when these rats (REM AIIA) were treated with aldosterone infusion the proteinuria,&#xD;
      hypertension and glomerulosclerosis seen were similar to REM alone rats, suggesting&#xD;
      deleterious renal hemodynamic effects of aldosterone independent of angiotensin II. Use of&#xD;
      spironolactone in these rats transiently reduced proteinuria and lowered arterial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous experiment in remnant kidney model also showed that adrenalectomy with adequate&#xD;
      glucocorticoid replacement reduced the proteinuria and other evidence of renal injury usually&#xD;
      seen in REM rats. Similarly heparin administration provides remarkably complete protection&#xD;
      from injury in remnant kidney model. Although this effect could be due to any of several&#xD;
      actions of heparin (anticoagulant and hemodynamic), it could be due to known suppressive&#xD;
      action of heparin on aldosterone synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), renal vascular injury causing&#xD;
      proteinuria and malignant nephrosclerotic lesions were markedly reduced by treatment with&#xD;
      spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor blocker. The effect of spironolactone alone was&#xD;
      comparable to effect of treatment with captopril, an ACE-inhibitor. In further studies Rocha&#xD;
      et al had shown that the ameliorating effect of ACE-inhibition in the SHRSP rats could be&#xD;
      fully reversed by infusion of aldosterone, suggesting a major role for aldosterone in the&#xD;
      vascular injury in these rats as well. Importantly the deleterious effect of aldosterone and&#xD;
      the protective effect of spironolactone against end organ damage in SHRSP rats appeared to be&#xD;
      independent of the blood pressure effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another experiment, the Wistar-Furth rat, an inbred strain resistant to actions of&#xD;
      mineralocorticoids, was used to study the concept that mineralocorticoids contribute to&#xD;
      progressive renal injury. Renal damage, as evidenced by albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis,&#xD;
      in response to 5/6 nephrectomy was markedly less in Wistar-Furth rats compared to Wistar&#xD;
      rats. Treatment of hypertension seen in the nephrectomized Wistar rats did not protect them&#xD;
      from renal injury suggesting again that mineralocorticoid mediated deleterious effect was&#xD;
      independent of the blood pressure effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperaldosteronism has been noted as a component of clinical chronic renal insufficiency of&#xD;
      various etiologies. In a cross sectional study of patients with mild to moderate renal&#xD;
      insufficiency Hene et al observed that level of serum aldosterone increased as creatinine&#xD;
      clearance fell below 70 cc/min and went up as high as 3-4 fold the baseline. Similarly in a&#xD;
      study of 9 patients with average inulin clearance of 27cc/min, Bauer and Reams noted plasma&#xD;
      aldosterone level to be four fold greater than normal. The significance of this&#xD;
      Hyperaldosteronism as to the progression of the renal insufficiency had not been studied&#xD;
      systematically, but in one longitudinal study Walker noted a significant correlation between&#xD;
      aldosterone level and rate of progression of renal failure. In this longitudinal study of 131&#xD;
      diabetic cohort, Walker noted that hypertension, plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone were&#xD;
      independent predictors of accelerated loss of renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the distal tubule is considered the target for aldosterone action, aldosterone&#xD;
      receptors had been found in myocardium, vascular smooth muscle cells and glomeruli .In vitro&#xD;
      studies of cultured mesangial cells revealed increased production of type IV collagen after&#xD;
      incubation with aldosterone. In a double blind controlled study MacFadyen and colleagues&#xD;
      observed that spironolactone treatment reduced circulating levels of procollagen type III&#xD;
      N-terminal amino peptide, a marker of vascular collagen turnover. Weber and other&#xD;
      investigators have observed that aldosterone caused myocardial fibrosis and this effect could&#xD;
      be ameliorated by treatment with spironolactone. In addition to the classical genomic action&#xD;
      through the type 1 mineralocorticoid receptor, aldosterone is now known to have significant&#xD;
      non-genomic mediated action in many different tissues including kidney tubules and vascular&#xD;
      smooth muscle cells. Aldosterone also up regulates Angiotensin II membrane receptors thereby&#xD;
      multiplying the vascular effect of Ang II. This upregulation was inhibited by treatment with&#xD;
      spironolactone. These findings are consistent with a synergistic action between Ang II and&#xD;
      aldosterone in the production of vascular injury as first proposed by Masson et al almost 4&#xD;
      decades ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ACE inhibitors may strongly inhibit the RAAS, but their suppressive effect on&#xD;
      aldosterone production may not be satisfactory. Indeed, in hypertension as well as in CHF,&#xD;
      continuous treatment with ACE inhibitor did not produce a sufficient decrease in plasma&#xD;
      aldosterone level, which remained high or increases eventually during long term use. In one&#xD;
      study, patients treated with hefty doses of captopril (300 mg/day) had a doubling of the&#xD;
      plasma aldosterone level at the end of 12 months of therapy despite marked decrease in ANG II&#xD;
      level. The reasons for the unsatisfactory suppressive effect of ACE inhibitors on plasma&#xD;
      aldosterone could be partly due to tachyphylaxis and also very likely due to predominance of&#xD;
      the non-RAAS component of the control system for aldosterone production. Urinary clearance of&#xD;
      aldosterone may also be reduced in CHF and CRF. On the basis of these understandings,&#xD;
      spironolactone (25-50 mg a day) was used in a large multi-centered randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial for treatment of congestive heart failure who already were receiving standard therapy&#xD;
      with Ace inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin. The study was terminated in midway because&#xD;
      interim analysis showed 30% reduction in mortality in the spironolactone treated group as&#xD;
      opposed to the control. Of note, the incidence of hyperkalemia in the treatment group was&#xD;
      only 1.7% as opposed to 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of gynecomastia was also&#xD;
      modest (10% Vs 1%) in spite of use of other drugs like digoxin that are known also to cause&#xD;
      gynecomastia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study we will recruit patients from the renal clinic at the VA medical center and&#xD;
      also some patients from the primary care clinics at the same hospital. The study will be a&#xD;
      double blind control study using each patient as his own control after a period of wash out&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetic nephropathy (with proteinuria exceeding 100 mg per day while on ace&#xD;
      inhibitor ) who are already being treated with ACE-Inhibitor at maximum tolerated dose. For&#xD;
      lisinopril this dose usually will be 20-40 mg per day. Patients who are on angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blocker ( ARB ) due to inability to tolerate ace inhibitor ( e.g. due to cough )&#xD;
      will be also considered for the study provided they stay on the same ARB at same dose&#xD;
      throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl Serum K greater than 5.0 meq/L Patients who need to&#xD;
      use spironolactone for some other reasons Life expectancy less than 1 year For this pilot&#xD;
      phase of the study we will investigate 30 patients (see attached sample size calculation)&#xD;
      equally divided into control and treatment groups. Patients will be randomly allocated to the&#xD;
      different groups by using computer generated randomization sequence. After 3 months on study&#xD;
      medication (or placebo) the study group of patients will be switched to the placebo group and&#xD;
      vice versa. Thus each patient will be his own control. There will be a month of wash out&#xD;
      period in between this change over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will be spironolactone. The starting dose will be 25 mg orally every day, which&#xD;
      will be increased to 50 mg every day, if tolerated after 4 weeks. A matching placebo will be&#xD;
      used for the placebo group. The VA pharmacy will prepare and provide the study drug as well&#xD;
      as the placebo. The pharmacy will create and maintain the randomization numbers in a safe&#xD;
      place so that the investigators and the study nurses remain blind to the whole randomization&#xD;
      process all throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol of lab studies and follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be seen by one of the investigator and have a brief history and physical&#xD;
      examination prior to randomization. All patients will have their blood pressured measured by&#xD;
      a study nurse in a sitting position (average of two BP readings taken at 5 minutes interval&#xD;
      will be recorded). Patients will be weighed at each visit also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study related visits would be prior to randomization, day of randomization, at 1 month&#xD;
      and at 3 month in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cycle will be repeated again for each patient after one month washout period after which&#xD;
      their study drug will be reversed (placebo to study and study to placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have the following lab studies at the beginning (prior to randomization),&#xD;
      at 1 month and at 3 month clinic visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal panel 24 hours urine for protein and creatinine Renal panel can be done in between the&#xD;
      prescribed study visits for clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be continued on their other usual medication during the study period and&#xD;
      changes will be made as deemed necessary by the clinicians taking care of patients. As far as&#xD;
      possible the dose of ace inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker) will be kept the same as&#xD;
      at the beginning of randomization. Doses of calcium channel blocker (if they are on it) will&#xD;
      also not be changed as much as possible during the study.&#xD;
