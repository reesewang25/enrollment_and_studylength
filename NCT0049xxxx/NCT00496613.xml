  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how chemotherapy affects an individual's&#xD;
      thinking abilities (cognition). Some research has shown that chemotherapy can cause changes&#xD;
      in cognition in breast cancer survivors. However, it is not clear why this change occurs. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will look to see if damage to DNA is related to these changes&#xD;
      in cognition. Specifically, the investigators want to see 1) if women who have been treated&#xD;
      with chemotherapy have more DNA damage than healthy women; and 2) if DNA damage is related to&#xD;
      cognitive problems in breast cancer survivors and healthy women.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this proposal is to obtain preliminary data regarding the&#xD;
      association between DNA damage and cognitive functioning in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
      Specifically, we predict that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy will have higher&#xD;
           levels of DNA damage as measured by the Comet assay as compared to age and education&#xD;
           matched survivors treated with hormonal therapy only and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Survivors who meet criteria for cognitive impairment will have higher levels of DNA&#xD;
           damage as compared to cancer survivors who do not meet criteria for cognitive impairment&#xD;
           and healthy controls.&#xD;
