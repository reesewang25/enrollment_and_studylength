      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the proportion of patients who experience partial or complete recollection&#xD;
           of symptoms of delirium and the level of distress associated with this recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine caregiver's level of distress associated with the patient's episode of&#xD;
           delirium.&#xD;

      Informed Consent for Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is often seen in patients with advanced cancer. Delirium is defined as confusion and&#xD;
      restlessness. In this study, cancer patients will be asked about their memory of experiencing&#xD;
      delirium and the distress related to those memories. Caregivers of those patients will also&#xD;
      be asked to participate, and they will be asked questions about their experience during these&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be tested using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale to see if you have recovered&#xD;
      from your delirium. If you are still eligible to take part in this study, and both you and&#xD;
      your caregiver agree to participate in this study; you will be asked by the research nurse to&#xD;
      complete several questionnaires that ask questions about your mental state, any memory of&#xD;
      experiencing delirium, the severity of the delirium, symptoms you experienced during the&#xD;
      delirium episode, and your level of emotional distress related to that event. If you and your&#xD;
      caregiver are asked to participate in this study; you will also be asked &quot;open-ended&quot;&#xD;
      questions (questions with no wrong answers) regarding the experience you had during the&#xD;
      severe episode of delirium; your memories of the experience, and the overall distress related&#xD;
      to it. This conversation will be tape recorded, and it will be written down word-for-word,&#xD;
      for the purpose of analysis. The conversation is expected to last no more than 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments and questionnaires will be conducted only at the time of interview. No&#xD;
      further assessments or questions will be done after the completion of the study. All&#xD;
      information collected for the study will be kept confidential. You will be assigned a study&#xD;
      participant number when you enroll on the study, and this number will be used (instead of&#xD;
      your name) on all data collections, to protect your confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 100 patients and 100 caregivers will take part in&#xD;
      this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

      Informed Consent for Caregivers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is often seen in patients with advanced cancer. Delirium is defined as confusion and&#xD;
      restlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, you will be asked about your memory of your family member's experience of&#xD;
      delirium, and the distress related to those memories. The patient you are caring for will&#xD;
      also be asked to participate, and they will be asked questions about their experience during&#xD;
      these situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible to take part in this study, and both you and your family member agree to&#xD;
      participate in this study, you will be asked by the research nurse to complete several&#xD;
      questionnaires that ask questions about your family member's mental state, your memory of&#xD;
      your family member's experience of delirium, the severity of the delirium, symptoms your&#xD;
      family member experienced during the delirium episode, and your level of emotional distress&#xD;
      related to that event. If you and your caregiver are asked to participate in this study; you&#xD;
      will also be asked &quot;open-ended&quot; questions (questions with no wrong answers) regarding the&#xD;
      experience you had during your family member's severe episode of delirium, your memories of&#xD;
      the experience, and the overall distress related to it. This conversation will be recorded&#xD;
      using a tape recorder, and it will be written down word for word, for the purpose of&#xD;
      analysis. The conversation is expected to last no more than 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments and questionnaires will be conducted only at the time of interview. No&#xD;
      further assessments or questions will be done after the completion of the study. All&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. If the patient has a complete recovery from the episode of delirium, the patient must&#xD;
             be approached within 3 days for the possibility of inclusion in study. &quot;Complete&#xD;
             recovery&quot; will be defined as diagnosis of complete resolution of all symptoms of&#xD;
             delirium according to DSM-IV-TR criteria by one of the palliative care specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability to communicate in the English language.&#xD;
&#xD;

             comprehend the assessment questionnaire, and is at the bedside for a significant&#xD;
             length of time (approximately 4 hours) each day during the delirium episode. Both the&#xD;
             patient and their caregiver must agree to participate for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Written informed consent signed by the patients and the participating caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. MDAS [Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale] &lt; 13 (Scores of 13 or above likely reflect&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Patients will be recruited from the palliative care mobile team or the inpatient&#xD;
             palliative care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Refusal of both the patient and their caregiver to complete assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to complete assessment due to sensorial deficits other than cognition; e.g.&#xD;
             blindness, deafness, aphasia, etc., that might impact the patient's ability to recall&#xD;
