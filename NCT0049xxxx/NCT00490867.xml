      In the present study, endothelium dependent vasodilation will be induced by administration of&#xD;
      acetylcholine (ACh). To ascertain whether the vascular effects, if any, of α-lipoic acid are&#xD;
      limited to the endothelium, endothelium independent vasodilation will also be assessed by&#xD;
      administration of glyceroltrinitrate (GTN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives To investigate the effect of α-lipoic acid therapy on endothelium dependent&#xD;
      and independent vasodilation, assessed by forearm blood flow (FBF), in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blinded, parallel group study for 23 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: FBF responses to acetylcholine and glyceroltrinitrate Day 2-22: intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of 600 mg α-lipoic acid or placebo Day 23: FBF responses to acetylcholine and&#xD;
      glyceroltrinitrate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population 30 subjects with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication Acetylcholine (ACh) - intraarterial infusion, 25, 50, 100 nmol/min, infusion&#xD;
      period 3 minutes/dose level Glyceroltrinitrate (GTN) - intraarterial infusion, 4, 8, 16&#xD;
      nmol/min, infusion period 3 minutes/dose level α-lipoic acid - intravenous infusion of 600 mg&#xD;
      in 250 ml saline solution over 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome variables Forearm blood flow (Ratio between intervention and control arm)&#xD;
      Additional outcome variables Arterial blood pressure, pulse rate, markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress, Insulin plasma levels, Glucose plasma levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/benefit assessment The insertion of intravenous cannula may cause mild and transient&#xD;
      pain. A minor hematoma may occur at the site of cannula insertion. The insertion of the&#xD;
      intraarterial cannula is performed under local anaesthesia and causes mild pain. The&#xD;
      meassurement of forearm bloodflow, espacialy the wrist cuff (&gt;200 mmHG) may be uncomfortably.&#xD;
      Local administration of drugs through a needle in the brachial artery allows the study of&#xD;
      direct vascular effects of the drugs. Drug doses are 100 to 1000 times lower than a systemic&#xD;
      effective dose, therefore no systemic adverse events are expected. There is experience in&#xD;
      brachial artery infusions at our institution, and it is considered a safe technique. α-lipoic&#xD;
      acid was well tolerated in healthy volunteers and subjects with diabetes at doses up to 600&#xD;
      mg intravenously and 1800 mg orally with side effects comparable with placebo. Altogether 50&#xD;
      ml blood will be collected throughout the study.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes is associated with a marked increase in the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Before overt cardiovascular disease occurs, impairment of vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function is detectable. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes, indicating that diabetes is associated with endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction. Recently, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been linked to&#xD;
      diabetes. These heterogeneous group of highly reactive compounds interact with NO and thereby&#xD;
      inhibit vasodilation caused by NO. Formation of ROS is therefore thought to be an important&#xD;
      mechanism by which type 2 diabetes induces endothelial dysfunction. α-Lipoic acid, which has&#xD;
      been used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, was shown to have antioxidant capacities&#xD;
      in vitro and animal experiments. Short term treatment with intraarterial α-lipoic acid was&#xD;
      shown to improve endothelium dependent vasodilation in type 2 diabetics. However, to date, no&#xD;
      data exists about the long term effcts of α-lipoic acid on vascular function in type 2&#xD;
      diabetics. In the present study, endothelium dependent vasodilation will be induced by&#xD;
      administration of acetylcholine (ACh). To ascertain whether the vascular effects, if any, of&#xD;
      α-lipoic acid are limited to the endothelium, endothelium independent vasodilation will also&#xD;
      be assessed by administration of glyceroltrinitrate (GTN).&#xD;
