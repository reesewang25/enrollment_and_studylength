  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if men who have a type of prostate&#xD;
      cancer that has been classified as &quot;low risk&quot; can safely not be treated for the disease.&#xD;
      Doctors want to know if patients with &quot;low risk&quot; cancer can avoid or postpone therapy and the&#xD;
      related side effects and still live as long as patients who immediately receive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. There are no medications used in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1,000 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      You have an early stage of prostate cancer that can be treated effectively with surgery or&#xD;
      radiation. If you choose to take part in this study, you will be agreeing to receive only&#xD;
      active surveillance. Active surveillance is an investigational way to manage low-stage small&#xD;
      volume prostate cancer. While on active surveillance, you will have no treatment for the&#xD;
      prostate cancer. However, you will have repeated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) tests,&#xD;
      physical exams, and other testing to detect when the cancer is becoming a greater risk which&#xD;
      may require you to begin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to participate in this study, you will not have standard therapy for prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Your diagnosis will be confirmed as being of low risk by tests at MD Anderson. Blood&#xD;
      will be drawn for PSA tests at the beginning of the study and every 6 months to monitor your&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a biopsy of the prostate at the beginning of the study. Additional prostate&#xD;
      biopsies will be performed at your first repeat biopsy at Year 1, and when a doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have digital rectal examination every 6 months to see if your doctor can feel any&#xD;
      prostate nodules. You will have a transrectal ultrasonography every 12 months to see if your&#xD;
      doctor can detect any abnormalities in the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, you will fill out 7 surveys at the beginning of the study and again every 6&#xD;
      months about how you are coping with the disease and the quality of your life. Each survey&#xD;
      will take 5 to 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While you are on study, if an exam or test results show that your disease is getting worse,&#xD;
      you will be given the opportunity to have treatment to remove the cancer. If you do choose to&#xD;
      receive treatment, you will be taken off study and continue to receive standard follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 12 months, the study staff will review your medical record or you will be called or&#xD;
      e-mailed and asked how you are doing. If you are called, the call would only last a few&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. About 1,000 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients will have histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the prostate within six&#xD;
             months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must agree to have repeat extended 11-core multisite biopsy (sextant&#xD;
             locations, midline, and 2 cores each from the left and right anterior horn) of the&#xD;
             prostate at study entry. A baseline prostate biopsy is not indicated if a repeat&#xD;
             biopsy following the extended biopsy scheme (at least 10 biopsy cores) was performed&#xD;
             at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) within 6 months of&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have clinically localized cancer defined by pathologic and PSA criteria&#xD;
             to be very low-risk/low-risk, patients with clinically localized cancer [not low-risk]&#xD;
             who have refused early intervention or chosen active surveillance as a management&#xD;
             option, and patients with clinically localized cancer who are precluded from local&#xD;
             therapy because of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must agree to comply with the surveillance schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non-English speaking patients may participate in the study, but they will not be&#xD;
             required to complete the surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active noncutaneous malignancy at any site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior radiation therapy for treatment of the primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Planned concomitant immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation&#xD;
