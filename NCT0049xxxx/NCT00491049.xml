    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether additional topical application of 0.5%&#xD;
      levofloxacin is more effective in reducing the load of the conjunctival bacterial flora in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for intraocular surgery than preoperative irrigation of the conjunctiva&#xD;
      with povidone iodine alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endophthalmitis is serious complication of intraocular surgery. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that the most common sources of bacteria causing endophthalmitis are the patients eyelid and&#xD;
      conjunctival bacteria. [1, 2] The risk of postoperative endophthalmitis may be reduced by&#xD;
      eliminating bacteria from the ocular surface at the time of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard for endophthalmitis prophylaxis at Ludwig-Maximilians-University in&#xD;
      Munich, Germany is the irrigation of the conjunctival fornices with 1% povidone-iodine (PVI)&#xD;
      prior to surgery. In general, patients do not receive topical antibiotic prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ta and co-workers have demonstrated that a three-day application of topical ofloxacin&#xD;
      resulted in less conjunctival cultures obtained before and after surgery compared to an&#xD;
      application of antibiotic given one hour prior to surgery.[3] Furthermore, the same research&#xD;
      group showed that the contamination rate of the microsurgical knives used during surgery&#xD;
      decreased from 26% to 5% (P = 0.028) with a three day application of ofloxacin compared to a&#xD;
      one-hour application.[4] The goal of the current proposal is to determine if we can improve&#xD;
      on the current standard of endophthalmitis prophylaxis at Ludwig-Maximilians-University by&#xD;
      using topical 5% levofloxacin prior to surgery. Given that the rate of endophthalmitis is&#xD;
      quite low, we will use conjunctival bacterial flora and anterior chamber aqueous&#xD;
      contamination rate as surrogate markers to determine the effectiveness of topical&#xD;
      levofloxacin in reducing or eliminating bacteria from the ocular surface at the time of the&#xD;
      surgery. The results of this prospective-randomized control trial may radically change the&#xD;
      current practice of endophthalmitis prophylaxis, and levofloxacin may play a critical role in&#xD;
      preventing postoperative endophthalmitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and forty patients will be randomized to control group and a study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: no antibiotic (70 patients). Standard protocol at the Department of&#xD;
           Ophthalmology, Munich.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group I: topical 0.5% levofloxacin four times per day for one day prior to&#xD;
           surgery. In addition, one drop of topical levofloxacin is given three times with five&#xD;
           minutes intervals, one hour prior to surgery (70 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five minutes prior to surgery both groups will receive topical povidone-iodine (10%) to scrub&#xD;
      the periorbital area and 1% PVI to irrigate the conjunctiva (standard protocol). Patients&#xD;
      will be draped in a sterile fashion and surgery will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conjunctival cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria will be obtained at the following&#xD;
      time-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ T0: (Baseline) at the day of the first interview (one week before surgery), prior to any&#xD;
      application of antibiotic or povidone-iodine. Samples will be taken from both conjunctivas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1: On the morning of the surgery, but prior to final treatment during the last hour&#xD;
           before surgery. At this time, patients in both study groups will have received topical&#xD;
           levofloxacin (one day and three days before surgery) treatment; patients in the control&#xD;
           group will not have received any treatment with antibiotic. Samples will be taken also&#xD;
           from both conjunctiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2: Immediately before surgery, 5-10 min after PVI scrub and PVI irrigation for both the&#xD;
           control and study group, but only on the conjunctiva of surgery eye. In addition of&#xD;
           sample of anterior chamber aqueous fluid is taken from the surgery eye by the&#xD;
           responsible surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T3: At the conclusion of surgery, again from the conjunctiva and the anterior chamber&#xD;
           fluid of the surgery eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every step, samples are taken from the conjunctiva with a standard dissolving Ca-alginate&#xD;
      swab (Sanofi-Pasteur, Germany). The moistened swab should be taken via one rotational swipe&#xD;
      over the lower conjunctiva without touching the lid or eyelashes. Additionally anterior&#xD;
      chamber aqueous fluid will be obtained immediately before and after surgery. The cannulas&#xD;
      (2x) used for the aspiration will be cultured in a separate broth culture, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients undergoing surgery for cataract, glaucoma or vitrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who report to be allergic to levofloxacin or iodine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on topical antibiotic within the last 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with acute conjunctivitis, blepharitis or dacryocystitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients under age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study may revolutionize the standard of endophthalmitis prophylaxis. It&#xD;
      could be that the application of topical levofloxacin 5%, four times a day for one or three&#xD;
      days prior to surgery, significantly reduce or eliminate bacteria from the ocular surface.&#xD;
      Hence, topical levofloxacin may have a critical role in preventing postoperative&#xD;
      endophthalmitis.&#xD;
