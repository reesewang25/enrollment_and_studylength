  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Originally thought to be a rare occurrence, BCVI are now diagnosed in approximately 1% of&#xD;
      blunt trauma patients. Initially BCVI were thought to have unavoidable devastating neurologic&#xD;
      outcomes. But early reports suggested anticoagulation might decrease these events. If&#xD;
      untreated, carotid artery injuries (CAI) have a stoke rate up to 50% depending on injury&#xD;
      grade, with increasing stroke rates correlating with increasing grades of injury. Current&#xD;
      studies report early treatment with antithrombotics - either heparin or anti-platelet agents&#xD;
      - in patients with BCVI markedly reduces stroke rates and resultant neurologic morbidity. As&#xD;
      reports of bleeding complications have altered heparin protocols in these patients, the use&#xD;
      of antiplatelet agents is attractive. Although heparin has been has been proposed as the gold&#xD;
      standard treatment due to its initial empiric use, no comparative studies of antithrombotic&#xD;
      agents has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, Grade I-III blunt carotid and vertebral arterial injuries (BCVI) have the potential&#xD;
      for stroke, and should be treated. Heparin has not been shown to clearly improve healing&#xD;
      rates compared with antiplatelet therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      systemic anticoagulation alters the course of Grade I-III BCVI compared with antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy. The investigators study hypothesis is that Grade I-III BCVI will heal or progress to&#xD;
      pseudoaneurysm formation, independent of systemic antithrombotic regimen, and that the&#xD;
      combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is equally efficacious in preventing neurologic&#xD;
      symptoms compared to systemic heparin associated with Grade I-III BCVI.&#xD;
