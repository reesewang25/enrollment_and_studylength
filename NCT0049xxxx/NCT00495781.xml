      The purpose of the study is to define laboratory parameters which are best suited to diagnose&#xD;
      functional iron deficiency. Functional iron deficiency is a condition where - due to the lack&#xD;
      of iron bioavailability - the patient suffers from symptoms such as fatigue and weakness, or&#xD;
      his/her capacity to produce red blood cells is reduced.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In dialysis patients the degree of anemia is highly correlated to both morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. A drop in Hb by 10 g/L translates into an increase in the rate of hospitalizations&#xD;
      of 5 to 6 % and a rise in mortality by 4 to 5 %. The past two decades have seen great&#xD;
      progress in the treatment of renal anemia with the advent of erythropoietin, and, more&#xD;
      recently, darbepoetin. Quite soon, however, it became clear, that anemia in patients with&#xD;
      chronic renal failure is complicated by a lack of bioavailable iron, which confers these&#xD;
      patients partly resistant to treatment with erythropoietin/darbepoetin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several parameters in use to estimate total body iron stores in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Serum iron represents only a minor fraction of&#xD;
      total body iron and is subject to major fluctuations due to influx or efflux from tissue iron&#xD;
      stores. In addition, it shows a great diurnal variability, and is therefore a very poor&#xD;
      parameter of iron deficiency. Iron saturation of its transporter protein in blood,&#xD;
      transferrin, is similarly difficult to interpret, as it depends also in part on the&#xD;
      determination of serum iron levels. Ferritin, the tissue iron storage protein, is released&#xD;
      into the circulation during active liver cell damage, and, quite unlike serum transferrin&#xD;
      levels, ferritin levels rise during the acute phase response of the inflammatory reaction. In&#xD;
      most cases, however, the serum ferritin level, if substantiated by the concurrent&#xD;
      determination of the C-reactive protein and the alanine-leucine-aminotransferase (ALT) to&#xD;
      exclude both, occult liver cell damage and inflammation, correlates well with total body iron&#xD;
      stores and total body iron deficiency, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serum ferritin level, however, is a poor marker of functional iron deficiency when&#xD;
      erythropoiesis is inhibited by the relative lack bioavailable iron in high turnover states of&#xD;
      the bone marrow such as in hemolysis and in the thalassemias. Correspondingly, in patients&#xD;
      with hemochromatosis and an increased functional iron availability, erythropoiesis will be&#xD;
      augmented following acute blood losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date no golden standard exists to measure functional iron deficiency in a routine clinical&#xD;
      setting. As a matter of fact, in some clinical studies functional iron deficiency is still&#xD;
      diagnosed indirectly and retrospectively by the effect of an iron substitution therapy&#xD;
      (increase in Hb by 10 g/L following 4 weeks of iron supplementation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of hemoglobin-deficient, hypochromic erythrocytes, as measured by some&#xD;
      hemocytometers, reflects the availability of iron for erythropoiesis and has become a&#xD;
      surrogate marker of functional iron deficiency. As the lifespan of erythrocytes varies&#xD;
      according to the degree of the patient's uremia between approximately 60 and 120 days,&#xD;
      hypochromic erythrocytes, measured as a percentage of total erythrocytes (%-Hypo), become&#xD;
      detectable only late in the course of erythropoietin therapy, and are therefore thought by&#xD;
      some to be of only limited sensitivity in the diagnosis of functional iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the automated measurement of reticulocytes, it has become now possible on some&#xD;
      hemocytometers, such as the Advia 120, to also determine the hemoglobin content in newly&#xD;
      formed reticulocytes (CHr). The hemoglobin content of reticulocytes mirrors more closely the&#xD;
      current availability of iron for erythropoiesis. What would make CHr so attractive for&#xD;
      clinicians and the clinical laboratory, is not only its acclaimed sensitivity to detect&#xD;
      functional iron deficiency, but, even more so, its easy availability, as it forms part of a&#xD;
      simple reticulocyte count on a normal hemocytometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other hemocytometric systems laser light scatter patterns have been utilized to&#xD;
      characterize the hemoglobin content in reticulocytes (RET-HE). This new parameter, RET-HE,&#xD;
      has been shown to be of a similar sensitivity and specificity as CHr and to give comparable&#xD;
      results in clinical samples (CHr, r = 0.94).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is meant to define the laboratory parameter (%-Hypo/CHr or RET-He) which is&#xD;
      suited best to diagnose functional iron deficiency. The study design asks for the parameter&#xD;
      with which physicians will be able to diagnose their patients so to improve the management of&#xD;
      their anemia. A diagnostic parameter is searched for which improves the patients' treatment&#xD;
      the most, as measured by blood hemoglobin levels (primary end point 1), at the lowest&#xD;
      possible costs (primary end point 2).&#xD;
