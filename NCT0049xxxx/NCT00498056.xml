  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of a safe and effective vaccine is the best strategy for preventing the&#xD;
      spread of HIV-1. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      and immune responses to an HIV vaccine regimen in healthy adults at risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of people infected by HIV-1 worldwide continues to increase. However,&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy is largely unavailable in low- and middle- income countries where risk&#xD;
      of infection is very high. The development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent HIV&#xD;
      infection is urgently needed. This study will evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of an experimental multiclade HIV vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, followed by an&#xD;
      adenovirus-vectored vaccine boost, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, in HIV uninfected adults. Both&#xD;
      vaccines code for proteins from HIV subtypes A, B, and C, which together represent 75% to 85%&#xD;
      of new HIV infections in the world. Adenoviral type 5-based vaccines have improved induction&#xD;
      of HIV-specific CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cell responses, which correlate with lower HIV&#xD;
      burden (viral load) and slower disease progression in primates and in HIV-1 infected people&#xD;
      whose disease does not progress over the long term. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of and immune response to a series of multiclade DNA vaccine&#xD;
      injections followed by a booster injection of a multiclade adenovirus vaccine against HIV-1&#xD;
      infection in healthy adults at risk for HIV infection in North and South America, the&#xD;
      Caribbean, and Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last from about 3 years to 5 years, because the length of the study depends&#xD;
      on how quickly people enroll and how quickly during the study new HIV-1 infections occur.&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive a total of three injections of the&#xD;
      DNA vaccine VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP followed by one injection of the adenovirus vaccine&#xD;
      VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, for a total of four injections of vaccine or four injections of placebo.&#xD;
      Injections will occur at study entry and Weeks 4, 8, and 24. Prior to the study injections,&#xD;
      participants will have their vital signs and weight measured, and blood collection will&#xD;
      occur. Participants will be observed in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after each&#xD;
      injection for immediate reactions to the vaccines. At all injection visits, HIV&#xD;
      risk-reduction counseling, HIV risk assessment, pregnancy prevention counseling, and training&#xD;
      on how to use memory cards will also occur. For 3 to 7 days after each injection,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to record information about injection site pain, redness, size,&#xD;
      swelling, temperature, general well-being, and headaches on their memory cards. Additional&#xD;
      study visits will occur on Weeks 1, 12, 28, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144. At these visits,&#xD;
      physical examinations, blood collection, and social impact questionnaires may also be done.&#xD;
      Any study participants who become infected with HIV while on the study will be monitored for&#xD;
      at least 72 weeks after diagnosis or at least 12 weeks after the study reaches its primary&#xD;
      evaluation time point (whichever is longer). The study investigators are committed to&#xD;
      providing access to local standard of care and treatment to those study participants who are&#xD;
      found to be HIV-1 infected.&#xD;
