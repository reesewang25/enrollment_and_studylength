    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous grafts are used as the vascular access in 40-50% of hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
      Grafts are prone to recurrent stenosis (narrowing) and thrombosis (clotting). Graft clotting&#xD;
      is usually due to a narrowing at the site where the graft joins the vein. The standard&#xD;
      treatment is to remove the clot and angioplasty the narrowed area. The long-term outcome is&#xD;
      not good, lasting only about 1 month. Placing a stent (a small metallic, PTFE covered,&#xD;
      spring) at the narrowed site may keep the graft open longer. Principal investigator's&#xD;
      preliminary research data suggest that placing a stent at the stenotic site prolongs graft&#xD;
      patency following thrombectomy, as compared to conventional angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized clinical trial, in which patients with a clotted graft&#xD;
      with underlying stenosis at the venous anastomosis of the graft will be allocated to&#xD;
      thrombectomy + angioplasty (control group) or to thrombectomy + stent placement (study&#xD;
      group). The primary endpoint will be primary (unassisted) graft patency. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be secondary (assisted) graft patency and overall access-related costs.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary patency of grafts following thrombectomy and angioplasty is limited by the&#xD;
           high re-stenosis rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stent deployment reduces the likelihood of re-stenosis at the site of the stenotic&#xD;
           lesion, thereby prolonging primary graft patency following thrombectomy, and decreasing&#xD;
           or delaying the need for future interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The cost savings arising from stent deployment (decrease in subsequent access&#xD;
           procedures) outweigh the additional cost of the stent itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate whether stent placement in thrombosed grafts with underlying stenosis at the&#xD;
           venous anastomosis results in longer primary graft patency, as compared with angioplasty&#xD;
           alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether stent placement in thrombosed grafts with underlying stenosis at&#xD;
           the venous anastomosis reduces the subsequent cost of access procedures in excess of the&#xD;
           cost of the stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these goals, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial of hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients who are referred for treatment of thrombosed A-V grafts. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to be treated with thrombectomy + stent deployment or thrombectomy + angioplasty.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be primary (unassisted) graft patency. The secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      be secondary (assisted) graft patency and the cumulative cost of all access-related&#xD;
      procedures, hospitalizations, and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE AND BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with end-stage renal disease undergo hemodialysis thrice weekly to optimize&#xD;
      their survival, minimize medical complications, and enhance their quality of life. A reliable&#xD;
      vascular access is a critical requirement for providing adequate hemodialysis. The ideal&#xD;
      vascular access would be easy to place, ready to use as soon as it is placed, deliver high&#xD;
      blood flows indefinitely, and be free of complications. None of the existing types of&#xD;
      vascular accesses achieve this ideal. Among the three types of vascular access currently&#xD;
      available, A-V fistulas are superior to A-V grafts, which in turn are superior to dialysis&#xD;
      catheters. Recognizing the relative merits of the vascular access types, the NKF-DOQI&#xD;
      guidelines recommend placement of A-V fistulas in 50% of hemodialysis patients, A-V grafts in&#xD;
      40%, and dialysis catheters in 10% [19]. The actual current distribution of vascular accesses&#xD;
      among prevalent hemodialysis patients in the United States is 25-30% fistulas, 45-50% grafts,&#xD;
      and 25% dialysis catheters [20, 21]. Vascular access procedures and their subsequent&#xD;
      complications represent a major cause of morbidity, hospitalization and cost for chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients [22-26]. Over 20% of hospitalizations in hemodialysis patients in the&#xD;
      United States are access-related, and the annual cost of access morbidity is close to $1&#xD;
      billion [25].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-V grafts are more prone to recurrent stenosis and thrombosis than are fistulas, and require&#xD;
      multiple radiologic or surgical interventions to ensure their long-term patency for dialysis&#xD;
      [26]. A report from UAB observed that the first salvage procedure to maintain graft patency&#xD;
      (thrombectomy, angioplasty, or surgical revision) was required in 29% of grafts at 3 months,&#xD;
      52% at 6 months, 77% at 12 months, and 96% at 24 months [5]. Most grafts required multiple&#xD;
      interventions over time to maintain their patency for dialysis. A mean of 1.22 interventions&#xD;
      were required to maintain access patency per graft-year, including 0.51 thrombectomies, 0.54&#xD;
      angioplasties, and 0.17 surgical revisions. Secondary graft survival (time from initial&#xD;
      placement to permanent failure, regardless of number of interventions) has ranged from 59 to&#xD;
      87% at one year, and 50 to 73% at two years [27-35]. A number of studies have examined the&#xD;
      association of demographic and clinical factors with long-term graft survival, but no&#xD;
      consistent clinical predictor of poor graft outcome has emerged. Windus et al [27] observed&#xD;
      lower graft survival in diabetics as compared with nondiabetics. In contrast, three other&#xD;
      studies observed no significant difference in graft survival between diabetic and nondiabetic&#xD;
      patients [5, 35, 36]. Several investigators have reported a lack of association between&#xD;
      patient age or sex and long-term graft survival [5, 35-37]. Windus et al [27] found that&#xD;
      older age predicted lower graft survival in non-diabetics, but not in diabetic patients.&#xD;
      Graft survival is similar between upper arm and forearm grafts [5, 29]. Finally,&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia has been associated with shorter A-V graft survival in 2 reports [5, 36].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major cause of graft failure is thrombosis due to underlying stenosis of the venous&#xD;
      anastomosis, draining vein, or central vein [10, 38]. When the stenosis is not detected and&#xD;
      corrected in a timely fashion, grafts typically thrombose. Clotted grafts require&#xD;
      thrombectomy by either Radiology or Surgery, most commonly in association with correction of&#xD;
      the underlying stenosis. If graft patency cannot be restored, it becomes necessary to&#xD;
      construct a vascular access at a new anastomotic site. Intervention-free graft patency is&#xD;
      considerably lower following thrombectomy than after elective angioplasty [10]. A comparison&#xD;
      of graft outcomes after radiologic interventions at our institution found that the primary&#xD;
      (unassisted) patency was only 30% at 3 months for clotted grafts, as compared with 71% for&#xD;
      patent grafts undergoing elective angioplasty [10]. Not surprisingly, graft survival was&#xD;
      worse if there was a residual stenosis after the angioplasty. However, even in the subset of&#xD;
      patients with no residual stenosis after the intervention, the primary 3-month patency was&#xD;
      still lower in clotted grafts, as compared with patent grafts undergoing elective angioplasty&#xD;
      (median survival, 2.5 vs 6.9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because graft patency is much worse following thrombectomy than after elective angioplasty,&#xD;
      the current state of clinical access management involves an ongoing surveillance program to&#xD;
      monitor for evidence of hemodynamically significant graft stenosis, and referral of such&#xD;
      patients for elective angioplasty or surgical revision. The rationale for this approach is&#xD;
      that correction of graft stenosis in a timely fashion will decrease the risk of graft&#xD;
      thrombosis and prolong the survival of the graft [19]. Substantial clinical research has been&#xD;
      directed at evaluating the predictive values of several noninvasive screening tests to&#xD;
      identify hemodynamically significant graft stenosis, so that the patients can be referred for&#xD;
      angioplasty or surgical revision before the graft has a chance to clot. These surveillance&#xD;
      methods have included: dynamic dialysis venous pressures, static dialysis venous pressures,&#xD;
      recirculation, Doppler ultrasound, ultrasound dilution methodology, and access blood flow&#xD;
      (Reviewed in [39]). Graft stenosis can also be predicted by aggressive clinical monitoring&#xD;
      (looking for decreases in Kt/V, prolonged bleeding at graft needle sites, and abnormalities&#xD;
      of graft inspection and auscultation [1, 40]. A number of observational studies have reported&#xD;
      substantial (50-60%) reductions in the frequency of graft thrombosis using a variety of&#xD;
      surveillance methods [40-43]; none have eliminated this problem. Four randomized studies&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of access surveillance on graft outcomes have found that surveillance&#xD;
      is an excellent tool for identifying hemodynamically significant graft stenosis. However, the&#xD;
      higher frequency of preemptive angioplasty in the surveillance group did not appear to&#xD;
      translate into a reduction in graft thrombosis or prolongation of graft survival [44-47].&#xD;
      This discrepancy suggests that preemptive angioplasty may not be effective in producing&#xD;
      sustained improvement of the stenotic lesion. Stent deployment may improve the durability of&#xD;
      graft angioplasty and decrease the variability between operators in graft patency following&#xD;
      radiologic interventions. Thus, it is possible that more frequent use of stents might enhance&#xD;
      the value of graft surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft stenosis occurs as a consequence of aggressive myointimal hyperplasia, which occurs&#xD;
      most commonly at the venous anastomosis [48]. Vascular injury resulting from the angioplasty&#xD;
      may actually accelerate the process of myointimal hyperplasia, thereby resulting in early&#xD;
      re-stenosis [49]. Endoluminal stents, by forming a rigid scaffold at the venous anastomosis,&#xD;
      may slow the encroachment of the area of myointimal hyperplasia into the vascular lumen,&#xD;
      thereby limiting the magnitude of recurrent stenosis. Thus, use of stents may be of utility&#xD;
      in preventing restenosis following angioplasty. Stent placement has been attempted for&#xD;
      treatment of grafts in which angioplasty results in suboptimal technical success or if the&#xD;
      stenosis recurs rapidly. A number of small series have reported the outcomes of stent&#xD;
      placement for vascular access with refractory stenosis [50-56]. Unfortunately, these studies&#xD;
      have suffered from several methodologic limitations, including retrospective data collection,&#xD;
      absence of a suitable control group, combining patent and thrombosed grafts, combining stents&#xD;
      placed at a variety of stenotic sites, and combining grafts with fistulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small, randomized study comparing stents with conventional angioplasty found no difference&#xD;
      in primary graft patency following the intervention [54]. However, this study enrolled a&#xD;
      mixture of clotted grafts and patent grafts, and the stenotic lesions were at a variety of&#xD;
      locations, limiting the interpretation of the findings. A recent, uncontrolled study reported&#xD;
      the outcomes of clotted grafts undergoing thrombectomy, as well as stent placement at the&#xD;
      venous anastomosis [50]. In this more homogeneous group of grafts, the primary graft patency&#xD;
      was 63% at 6 months. Although there was no matched control group treated with angioplasty&#xD;
      alone, the unassisted graft survival was far superior to that reported in several series (11&#xD;
      to 34% at 6 months)[10, 57-61]&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This will be an open-label, prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the&#xD;
      outcomes of thrombosed AV grafts treated with mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty&#xD;
      (current standard of care), as compared with stent deployment after mechanical thrombectomy&#xD;
      and angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: The subjects for this study will be recruited from the University of Alabama at&#xD;
      Birmingham (UAB) Nephrology practice. UAB provides medical care for approximately 500&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients, under the supervision of 12 full-time nephrologists. We average 150&#xD;
      graft thrombectomy procedures annually at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: After obtaining informed consent, the clinic chart will be reviewed for inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. The subject will undergo a screening evaluation including a history&#xD;
      and physical prior to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: All subjects with a recent thrombosed AV graft who meet the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and consent to participation in the study will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      angioplasty arm or the angioplasty plus stent deployment arm. Patients will be taken to the&#xD;
      interventional suite in the Interventional Radiology department. Randomization will occur&#xD;
      only after ascertaining that that graft flow has been restored and that there is a &gt;50%&#xD;
      stenosis at the venous anastomosis. Randomization will be accomplished by unsealing a&#xD;
      sequentially numbered opaque envelope that contains the randomization allocation for that&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angioplasty Arm: These patients will undergo the standard of care protocol: mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy plus angioplasty of the stenosis at the venous anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent Deployment Arm: These patients will undergo the same protocol as the angioplasty arm&#xD;
      but at the end a covered stent (wallgraft) will be deployed at the stenotic lesion of the&#xD;
      venous anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angioplasty Arm: All patients diagnosed with a thrombosed graft will undergo mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy within 48 hours of diagnosis in conjunction with angioplasty of the underlying&#xD;
      stenotic lesion. The grafts are initially accessed with a single needle at the arterial limb&#xD;
      of the graft. A glide wire is passed up to the central vessels and the needle exchanged for a&#xD;
      6-French catheter sheath. Mechanical thrombectomy is achieved with a Trerotola device. A&#xD;
      second 6-French sheath is placed in the venous limb of the graft, and a glide wire passed&#xD;
      into the arterial circulation. A Fogarty balloon is passed through the wire beyond the&#xD;
      arterial anastomosis and pulled back to dislodge the clot. An anterograde and retrograde&#xD;
      angiogram of the graft is performed to assess patency and to look and grade the stenotic&#xD;
      lesions. Lesions at the venous anastomosis with at least 50% stenosis are considered&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant. An angioplasty balloon is placed and inflated at the level of&#xD;
      the stenotic site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent Arm: The procedure will be identical to that followed in the angioplasty arm. However,&#xD;
      after the stenotic lesion has been angioplastied, the appropriate Bard Fluency-cPTFE&#xD;
      Encapsulated Nitinol Stent will be deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive 3000 to 4000 units of heparin during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient receive conscious sedation with Fentanyl and Versed, unless allergic to either&#xD;
      one&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both randomized groups, a final angiogram of the graft will be performed, and the residual&#xD;
      stenosis at the site of the angioplasty quantified. In addition, intra-graft and systemic&#xD;
      blood pressures will be measured upon completion of the intervention. These pressures will be&#xD;
      measured directly through a disposable pressure transducer. The ratio of graft to systemic&#xD;
      systolic pressure will be calculated. This ratio has been previously shown to be predictive&#xD;
      of subsequent primary graft patency [1, 10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Intervention for Either Arm: Subsequent graft interventions will be determined by&#xD;
      the clinical judgment of the patient's nephrologists, independently of the study&#xD;
      intervention. Such intervention may include mechanical thrombectomy with angioplasty if the&#xD;
      graft re-thromboses; referral for diagnostic fistulogram with possible angioplasty if there&#xD;
      is clinical suspicion o graft stenosis; surgical revision if the graft has a stenosis that is&#xD;
      not amenable to radiologic intervention; and placement of a dialysis catheter if graft&#xD;
      patency cannot be restored. All these events will be tracked prospectively. Completeness of&#xD;
      information about subsequent access interventions will be optimized by a cross-check with the&#xD;
      Division of Nephrology prospective, computerized, access database maintained by our Access&#xD;
      Coordinators [40].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints. The primary end point will be the primary patency of the graft (time from the&#xD;
      initial thrombectomy to the next graft intervention (angioplasty, thrombectomy, or surgical&#xD;
      revision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end points are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Secondary patency, (time from thrombectomy to permanent graft failure, regardless of&#xD;
           number of subsequent salvage procedures)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total cost of access procedures and access complications per year of followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Period: Subjects will be followed for a period of 2 years from the date of&#xD;
      randomization. Prospective data will be collected on (1) all subsequent access procedures&#xD;
      (angioplasty, thrombectomy, surgical revision, or placement of dialysis catheter), (2) all&#xD;
      access-related hospitalizations (those due to an access complication or non-access related&#xD;
      hospitalizations in which an access procedure is performed), and (3) all access-related&#xD;
      complications, e.g., catheter-related bacteremia or metastatic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Power calculations were performed by the statistician (Jill Barker, Ph.D.) on&#xD;
      the basis of our preliminary data from the outcome of thrombosed grafts at UAB. The estimated&#xD;
      sample of 130 patients, evenly divided between the two groups, was sufficient to detect a&#xD;
      tripling in median graft survival from 1 month on the control arm to 3 months on the stent&#xD;
      arm, assuming an exponential distribution, 3 years of accrual, 1 year of followup, two-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05, and power of 0.80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The statistical analysis will be done in collaboration with Jill Barker, Ph.D.&#xD;
      (Consultant). Baseline patient characteristics between the 2 groups will be compared by&#xD;
      unpaired Student t-tests or Chi-square analysis, as appropriate. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Primary and secondary graft survivals curves will be&#xD;
      generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The differences in graft survival between groups will&#xD;
      compared by log rank test. In addition, the association between baseline clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and graft survival will be analyzed by univariate and multi-variable&#xD;
      regression analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model. The costs of all subsequent&#xD;
      access-related procedures, hospitalizations, and complications will be determined using&#xD;
      Medicare reimbursement rates in Alabama. The total cost of access care between groups will be&#xD;
      compared by unpaired Student t-tests.&#xD;
