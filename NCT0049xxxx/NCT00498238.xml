      We evaluated the effect of levothyroxine in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) on arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, lipid profile and inflammation. Thirty-four patients with SCH were included.&#xD;
      Patients were treated with levothyroxine for 7 months. Arterial stiffness was evaluated by&#xD;
      Augmentation index (AIx). After accomplishing euthyroidism, the AIx decreased from 8.3±17.2&#xD;
      to 6.5±14.3(P&lt;0.01) and AIx percentage decreased from36.2 11.5 ± to 9.1±33.2 (P =0.03).&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure decreased from 20±134.7 to mmHg 13.7±127.6 (P&lt;0.01). No significant&#xD;
      improvement was found in other parameters. In patients whose AIx's decreased, LDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      levels decreased by 37.1±-15.5 mg/dl compared to the patients whose AIx's didn't decrease and&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol increased by 57.4±24.1 mg/dl (P=0.057). We concluded that in patients&#xD;
      suffering from SCH, treatment with levothyroxine had a significant beneficial effect on&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and systolic blood pressure and no effect on lipid profile or&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a disorder characterized by high levels of thyrotropin&#xD;
      (thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)), accompanied by normal levels of thyroxine (T4). There is&#xD;
      most probably an association between SCH and cardiovascular disease, however the relationship&#xD;
      between SCH and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is still in debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hak et al. and Walsh et al. found that patients with SCH have increased risk for ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease. Female smokers over 50 years, with TSH levels above 10 mU/L, were at a higher&#xD;
      risk. However, a study conducted by Rodondi et al. did not find that SCH increases the risk&#xD;
      for cardiac ischemia, peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with SCH are hypertention, atherogenic&#xD;
      lipid profile, high levels of c-reactive protein (CRP), changes in the clotting system,&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that patients with SCH suffer from increased arterial stiffness and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. One of the non invasive techniques to evaluate arterial stiffness is&#xD;
      pulse wave analysis (PWA). PWA gives information of blood pressure at the aortic site rather&#xD;
      than more peripherally. Recently, calculated AIx was suggested as an independent risk marker&#xD;
      for cardiovascular adverse events. Obuobie et al. analyzed the pressure wave velocity in 12&#xD;
      patients with overt hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine. They concluded that&#xD;
      hypothyroid patients treated with levothyroxine had a decrease in their arterial stiffness&#xD;
      after treatment, although no difference in the lipid profile was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taddei et al. showed that patients with SCH are characterized by endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      resulting from a reduction in nitric oxide (NO); this alteration was partially independent of&#xD;
      dyslipidemia and reversed by levothyroxine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of levothyroxine treatment on blood pressure,&#xD;
      lipid profile, highly sensitive CRP (hs- CRP) and arterial stiffness in patients with SCH.&#xD;
      Whether SCH is a &quot;laboratory&quot; disease only or it affects blood vessels is a question still in&#xD;
      controversy. We do not know yet if levothyroxine therapy will reverse some of the &quot;silent&quot;&#xD;
      problems of SCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Thirty four patients with laboratory evidence of subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH&#xD;
      levels 4-25 mU/L and normal T4 values) in at least two following tests (one month apart from&#xD;
      each other) were recruited from an endocrinology outpatient clinic for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was approved by the local Helsinki Committee for experiments on Humans and all&#xD;
      patients gave informed consent. The exclusion criteria were recent (less than 6 months)&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event or angiography with stent placement, serious&#xD;
      infection in the month before recruitment, any use of contrast media in the last 6 months,&#xD;
      loss of more than 5% of body weight during the last 6 months, cardiac arrhythmias, ejection&#xD;
      fraction of less than 40%, active malignant diseases, previous thyroid disease and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The patients were treated with levothyroxine (Eltroxin, Glaxo) at a starting&#xD;
      dose of 50 mcg per day. The follow up was conducted in the Research and Development unit,&#xD;
      Assaf Harofeh Medical Center at 1, 4 and 7 months post dosing. In patients who did not&#xD;
      achieve normalization of TSH, the dose of levothyroxine was increased to 100 mcg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit the patients underwent a physical examination including blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
      and weight. Blood pressure was measured while the patient was in a recumbent position. Blood&#xD;
      was drawn for TSH, Hemoglobin, renal and liver function, total cholesterol, high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL- cholesterol), triglycerides (TG), oxidized low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and hs- CRP. LDL-cholesterol was calculated and arterial stiffness was&#xD;
      assessed. The patients' medication regimen was not changed throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness Assessment of arterial stiffness was performed by a noninvasive technique&#xD;
      using the commercially available SphygmoCor System (AtCor Medical LTD, Australia). All&#xD;
      measurements were performed while the patient was in a recumbent position at room temperature&#xD;
      of 25۫ C, between 06:30 and 08:30 A.M. after an overnight fasting (8-10 hours) and after a&#xD;
      short period of rest. Peripheral pressure waveforms were recorded from the radial artery at&#xD;
      the wrist, using applanation tonometry with a high fidelity micromanometer. When sequential&#xD;
      waveforms were recorded, a validated 16-18 generalized transfer function was applied to&#xD;
      generate the corresponding central pressure waveform. The integral system software was used&#xD;
      to calculate an average radial artery waveform and to derive a corresponding central aortic&#xD;
      pressure waveform using a previously validated generalized transfer function. From these data&#xD;
      the indexes of arterial stiffness were obtained. The augmentation of central arterial&#xD;
      pressure is the difference between the first and second systolic peaks of the central&#xD;
      pressure waveforms, and the central augmentation index (AIx) is the augmentation expressed as&#xD;
      a percentage of the pulse pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technology is easy to perform, non-invasive, simple, rapid (15 minutes per test) and&#xD;
      repeatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidized LDL Blood samples were collected in EDTA containing tubes. Separation of plasma was&#xD;
      performed by centrifugation at 2500 RPM for 10 minutes. In order to neutralize the effect of&#xD;
      rheumatoid factor on test accuracy, 5% anti-interference reagent was added to the plasma.&#xD;
      Concentration of ox-LDL was determined using an Elisa kit manufactured by Dyne Diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly sensitive CRP Level was measured using the latex immunonephelometry technique&#xD;
      according to manufacturer protocols. Levels were determined with a concentration restriction&#xD;
      of 0.0175 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were measured by standard techniques.&#xD;
