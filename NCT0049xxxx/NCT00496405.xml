      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was identified for the first time in the liquid of&#xD;
      ascitis in Guinean pigs (6,7). It is a dimeric glycoprotein, naturally expressed in&#xD;
      epithelial and tumor cells (1). It's over expression during retinal hypoxia (9), has been&#xD;
      implied in the genesis of diverse Neovascular diseases (2,4,8,9,19). The activation of the&#xD;
      VEGF pathway promotes endothelial cells growth, increases the growth, migration and survival&#xD;
      of the existing vasculature and produces the differentiation and migration of the endothelial&#xD;
      mother cells from the bone marrow towards the general circulation (4). It is also a&#xD;
      vasculature permeability factor, because it favors the formation of vascular fenestrations,&#xD;
      which produces the exit of liquid and protein deposit in the tissue interstice, favoring the&#xD;
      formation of macular edema and neovascularisation (3,8-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its activity is mediated by two tyrosine related receptors of high affinity: the VEGFR 1&#xD;
      (FLT-1) and VEGFR 2 (FLT-2) (1,9). The FLT-1 promotes the cellular proliferation whereas the&#xD;
      FLT-2 the migration and the interaction between cells and extracellular matrix(4,5,10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the industrialized and developing countries, the main cause of blindness is the diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy (9). Followed close in the United States and Europe by Age related Macular&#xD;
      Degeneration (10). The most frequent cause of loss of vision in diabetic retinopathy is&#xD;
      macular edema (7). Its incidence is between 13.9 to 25.4% (15). It is characterized by the&#xD;
      accumulation of intraretinal liquid at level of the outer plexiform and internal nuclear&#xD;
      layers, with the subsequent thickening of the macula (13,15). The diabetic macular Edema is&#xD;
      associated to high levels of VEGF in the vitreous (7,8,9). At the moment, the gold standard&#xD;
      in the treatment of the proliferative retinopathy is the laser photocoagulation(9). The&#xD;
      photocoagulation of the macular area for the treatment of diffuse or focal edema, produces a&#xD;
      50% decrease risk of severe visual loss. Nevertheless the long-term prognosis continues being&#xD;
      poor (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optical Coherent Tomography (OCT) is a relative new, noninvasive technique (12,14), based&#xD;
      in low frequency interferometry phenomenon. It is able to provide cross-sectional retinal&#xD;
      images (11,12,15,17). It has a resolution of 10-15mm. thanks to that, it is also able to&#xD;
      quantitatively measure macular thickness (10,12,14,15,17). The measurements obtained with&#xD;
      this system are highly reproducible and they correlated with patient visual acuity&#xD;
      (7,11,14,16,17,19). It is very useful when evaluating the vitreous-retinal interface and&#xD;
      retinal adherences(11). In the macular edema OCT displays low reflectivity images with&#xD;
      increase of retinal thickness(11,13). The classification of macular edema by OCT images,&#xD;
      proposed by Dr. Otani (16) and modified by Kang (15) consists of 4 types: Type 1, thickening&#xD;
      of the fovea with homogenous optical reflectivity in the entire retina. Type 2, thickening of&#xD;
      the retina with noticeable diminution of the optical reflectivity in the external layers of&#xD;
      the retina. Type 3, thickening of the fovea with accumulation of subfoveal liquid and a&#xD;
      defined border of detached retina. Type 3A without foveal traction, 3B with foveal traction&#xD;
      (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (Avastin, genentech , Inc., San Francisco, California, the USA) is a drug,&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of the metastatic colorectal cancer(2). It consists of&#xD;
      a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds all active forms of VEGF (3,18,19), blocking the&#xD;
      activity of its two receptors (4). In the last years its use &quot;off-label&quot;, in ophthalmology&#xD;
      field, has become popular. This is due to its proven safeness and effectiveness for the&#xD;
      treatment of diverse ocular diseases (2-4,7,20). Within the ophthalmic pathologies that have&#xD;
      been treated successfully with the Intravitreal administration of Bevacizumab, we can mention&#xD;
      different Neovascular pathologies (diabetic Retinopathy (9,18), age related macular&#xD;
      degeneration(2,4,18)) and pathologies that alter the vascular permeability (macular edema&#xD;
      (4,7), Central and branch retinal vein occlusion (3,8,20), central serous choroidopathy). In&#xD;
      all of them , treatment responses is characterized by an improvement of the visual acuity,&#xD;
      decrease of macular thickness and improvement of the angiographic patterns (8,10). The&#xD;
      potential complications of the use of Bevacizumab are the severe thromboembolic event,&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (18), epistaxis, proteinuria,hemoptysis, alteration in wound healing&#xD;
      and gastrointestinal bleed (4,10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposition of the Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot has been speculated about the systemic absorption of Bevacizumab. In a study at the&#xD;
      Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, doctors Rosenfeld, Puliafito et al demonstrated the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the systemic application of Bevacizumab for the treatment of the age related&#xD;
      macular degeneration applying dose of 5mg/Kg. thus Demonstrating, the passage of the molecule&#xD;
      from the systemic circulation to specific tissue in both eyes(10). Recently, doctor Bakri and&#xD;
      her team at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, establish that a small portion of&#xD;
      intravitreal bevacizumab is able to pass to the systemic circulation (1.6% of the injected&#xD;
      dose) obtaining detectable concentrations in the vitreous of the fellow eye (11.17ng/ml) at&#xD;
      week number 4 after the treatment (21). In the same way, we have cases in our hospital,&#xD;
      reported like anecdotal cases, of Bevacizumab application in one eye and improvement of the&#xD;
      base pathology in the fellow eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is for that reason that the objective of this study is the systematic and random revision&#xD;
      of the fellows eyes, of the patients programmed for the intravitreal administration of&#xD;
      Bevacizumab, with bilateral macular edema. In such a way that the therapeutic value of the&#xD;
      small concentrations reached in the vitreous of the fellow eye of bevacizumab can be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
