  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fall prevention in older adults is a significant public health issue that all health care&#xD;
      providers must address. At this time, chiropractors, the most commonly used complementary and&#xD;
      alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners, have not been systematically involved in either&#xD;
      interventions for or research related to fall prevention and risk factor reduction. However,&#xD;
      it is possible that body-based CAM practitioners such as chiropractors might make important&#xD;
      contributions to decreasing fall risk through affecting musculoskeletal function and managing&#xD;
      chronic pain, factors which may affect balance, an important risk factor for falls.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Aged 65 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to stand steadily without assistance on one leg for no more than 5 seconds&#xD;
             (determined by averaging the time for both legs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to attend all scheduled sessions (by self-report.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Non-ambulatory (that is, wheelchair bound); this precludes required balance testing;&#xD;
             however, potential patients requiring assistive devices such as canes and walkers are&#xD;
             not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. received chiropractic care, physical therapy or any other manual care procedure within&#xD;
             the past three months (by self report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. began an exercise program targeting balance and/or lower body strength within past&#xD;
             month (by self report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. contraindications to CMT or mild-exertion exercise, as determined by the clinician&#xD;
             through physical exam and x-rays (if indicated). Contraindications included but are&#xD;
             not limited to: unstable or severe medical condition; severe osteoporosis, fracture or&#xD;
             other osseous abnormalities; &quot;high cardiovascular risk&quot;, ie.e. persons with known&#xD;
             cardiovascular, pulmonary or metabolic disease, or one or more major signs/symptoms&#xD;
             suggestive of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. absence of indications for CMT, as determined by the clinician through history,&#xD;
             physical exam, orthopedic tests, and static and motion palpation. Indications for CMT&#xD;
             include identification of decreased or increased joint mobility usually accompanied by&#xD;
             tenderness and muscle tension and spasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. unable to understand English or Spanish adequately to complete study forms and&#xD;
             questionnaires, since for this study we do not have study personnel fluent in other&#xD;
             languages.&#xD;
