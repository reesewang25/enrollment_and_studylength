      Induction termination of pregnancy (second trimester abortion) has a median time of 14 hours&#xD;
      from the start of medication (misoprostol) to expulsion of the fetus. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate a method of 'priming' on the length of induction termination of&#xD;
      pregnancy. &quot;Priming&quot; refers to the use of medication to ready the cervix and uterus so that&#xD;
      the uterus is more sensitive to medication and contracts more effectively, and also refers to&#xD;
      softening of the cervix so that there is less resistance to dilation. Priming is used&#xD;
      extensively before induction of labor for term pregnancy and is also used extensively before&#xD;
      surgical abortion in second trimester. We would like to add priming the evening before&#xD;
      induction to the usual treatment and evaluate whether the length of the induction process is&#xD;
      shortened. Women are admitted to the hospital in the morning to start misoprostol medication,&#xD;
      and unless expulsion occurs within 8-10 hours, need to stay overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is to give the priming dose 12 hours before admission. The outcome of&#xD;
      interest is the induction time from the first dose on misoprostol in the hospital to&#xD;
      expulsion of the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess whether the use of misoprostol as a priming agent would be&#xD;
      beneficial with women who undergo induction termination of pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective series. All women enrolled will receive the same treatment. 10 women&#xD;
      without prior births and 10 women with prior births will be enrolled. The study design is to&#xD;
      give the priming dose 12 hours before admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of interest is the induction time from the first dose on misoprostol in the&#xD;
      hospital to expulsion of the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Women who have requested induction abortion and completed the counseling&#xD;
      and consent process for abortion. Women 18 years of age or over. Capable of giving informed&#xD;
      consent. Speak English or Spanish Pregnancy 18-23 weeks. No contraindication to misoprostol&#xD;
      abortion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Unable to understand and give informed consent. Pregnancy less than 18&#xD;
      weeks or over 23 weeks on the day of enrollment. Ruptured membranes or signs of infection&#xD;
      (temperature over 100.6 F,WBC &gt;15K) Fetal demise Multi-fetal pregnancy Contraindication to&#xD;
      any of the agents used for misoprostol induction abortion&#xD;
&#xD;
      After women have started the abortion process (completed counseling and consent for abortion,&#xD;
      and completed the fetocidal digoxin injection), they will be approached by one of the&#xD;
      investigators. The procedures and the consent process will be explained. If they consent,&#xD;
      they will be given an envelope which contains 50 mcg of misoprostol (1/2 of a 100 mcg&#xD;
      tablet). They will be instructed to place the tablet buccally and hold it in place for 30&#xD;
      minutes, after which it can be swallowed, between 8 and 9 pm that evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will return at 7 am the next morning; the actual induction process starts between 8 and&#xD;
      10 am depending on the bed situation. The reminder of the care is identical to women not in&#xD;
      the study and consists of misoprostol 400 every 6 hours. The only step that will be from the&#xD;
      current induction process is the administration of the priming dose the night before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of participation for individuals is up to 48 hours. The study overall will take&#xD;
      one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to estimate the effect on induction times, and to monitor for any&#xD;
      adverse events. This pilot will be the basis of further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the sample size is 19, a two-sided 95.0% confidence interval for a single mean will have&#xD;
      an interval that extends no more than 1.5 from the observed mean, assuming that the true&#xD;
      standard deviation is 3.25 and that the confidence interval is based on the t statistic. The&#xD;
      &quot;typical&quot; mean is 14 hours and the 95% confidence interval around 12.5 hours is 11hours to 14&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the induction time, the time from start of induction until fetal&#xD;
      expulsion. As there are about 80 induction procedures per year, and past studies have&#xD;
      enrolled 50-60% of eligible women, it will take approximately 6 months to complete&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of induction will be described and the mean will be contrasted to a typical value&#xD;
      (14 hours) . Minor events such as nausea will be tabulated. There will be a sub-analysis of&#xD;
      outcome by parity (women without prior births compared to women with prior births). This&#xD;
      study is not powered to show differences between these two groups but this information wil be&#xD;
      helpful in planning future studies.&#xD;
