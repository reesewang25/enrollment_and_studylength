    <textblock>
      The new NcIQ thoracic impedance monitor is based on the predicate device, the IQ101. The new&#xD;
      model uses the same 3-dimensional signal averaging as the original device, but also include&#xD;
      second radio frequency signal to permit the device to work &quot;wirelessly&quot;, i.e., without&#xD;
      electrode lead attachments to the patient. This study seeks to 1) validate the use of the new&#xD;
      device and confirm the correlation of the IQ101 and NcIQ. 2) Evaluate the ease of the new&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

      The new IQ2 thoracic impedance monitor is based on the predicate device, the IQ101. The new&#xD;
      model uses the same 3-dimensional signal averaging as the original device, but with smaller&#xD;
      housing and updated operating software. This study seeks to 1) Validate the use of the new&#xD;
      device and confirm the correlation of the IQ101 and IQ2. 2) Compare the ease of the devices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The IQ101 is the first generation of the non invasive cardiograph. This device uses impedance&#xD;
      to a micro-electric field passing from the electrodes. The NcIQ uses Radio frequencies and&#xD;
      the same 3 dimensional signal averaging algorithm used in the IQ101 to generate hemodynamic&#xD;
      data. The radio waves enables the device to work without the contact lead arrays used in the&#xD;
      IQ2 and can take measurements without even contacting the patient, hence can be applied&#xD;
      through clothing and is simple to apply. This makes the potential use by first responders a&#xD;
      possibility. The device measures the change in the radio wave reflection during the cardiac&#xD;
      cycle to estimate ardiac function. Specifically, it measures cardiac output, the amount of&#xD;
      blood pumped per minute, and other hemodynamic parameters previously only measurable with&#xD;
      invasive catheters. The data us used to generate a LIFESCORE and can measure and report&#xD;
      dangerous trends to the caretaker. The device has a companion device to download the data for&#xD;
      the hospital providers to create a seamless transfer of care. The new device uses technology&#xD;
      similar to the previous generation machine but has been miniaturized, given updated operating&#xD;
      system, and newer computer technology that helped make the device smaller, and faster. The&#xD;
      underlying patented algorithm was not changed. Therefore, it is expected to provide the same&#xD;
      degree of accuracy and precision as the predicate device.&#xD;

      The IQ101 is the first generation of the non invasive cardiograph. This device uses impedance&#xD;
      to a micro-electric field passing from the electrodes. The device can use the impedance and&#xD;
      the change in the impedance during the cardiac cycle to estimate thoracic fluid volumes and&#xD;
      cardiac function. Specifically, it measures cardiac output, the amount of blood pumped per&#xD;
      minute, and other hemodynamic parameters previously only measurable with invasive catheters.&#xD;
      There are many studies documenting the device's performance. The new device uses the same&#xD;
      technology but has been modernized with updated operating system, and newer computer&#xD;
      technology that helped make the device smaller, and faster. The device has also been&#xD;
      redesigned to make operator use simpler and reduce the number wires involved. The underlying&#xD;
      patented algorithm was not changed. Therefore, it is expected to provide the same degree of&#xD;
      accuracy and precision as the predicate device with simplified user interface and lighter,&#xD;
      smaller, more portable housing to improve ease of use.&#xD;
