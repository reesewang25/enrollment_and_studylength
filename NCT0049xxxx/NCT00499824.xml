      To test whether the International Diabetes Federation - Western Pacific Region (IDF-WPR)&#xD;
      Guidelines are more effective than standard practices in primary care (general practitioner)&#xD;
      clinics for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Asia. A 12-month&#xD;
      multinational multicentre prospective cluster randomisation clinical trial within a primary&#xD;
      care setting, with 2 parallel treatment arms: diabetes management using IDF-WPR guidelines&#xD;
      versus standard clinic practices. 400 subjects will be recruited from 100 sites (4 subjects&#xD;
      per site) in ten Asian countries (China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines,&#xD;
      Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam).&#xD;

      Description of intervention(s) / exposure and control treatment: This is a prospective&#xD;
      multinational, multicentre, cluster-randomised study conducted within the primary care&#xD;
      setting, with two parallel treatment arms: standard clinical practice versus education on&#xD;
      diabetes management using International Diabetes Federation - Western Pacific Region&#xD;
      (IDF-WPR) &quot;Type 2 diabetes practical targets and treatments&quot;. The study duration will be 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 General Practitioners (GPs) (10 per country) will be randomised to receive education on&#xD;
      the IDF-WPR guidelines or to receive no trial-related education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GPs in both groups will be required to recruit 4 of their own patients meeting the&#xD;
           eligibility criteria. The complete entry criteria are detailed in a following section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GPs in both groups will manage the recruited patients according to their own clinical&#xD;
           judgement. Frequency of patient visits to the GP's clinic will be determined by the GP.&#xD;
           All medication prescribed by the GPs should already be registered in the participating&#xD;
           countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sampling of patients will be required at Study Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline), Study&#xD;
           Visit 2 (month 6) and Study Visit 3 (month 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will comprise an educational program on the guidelines for GPs, and will be&#xD;
      carried out by the national coordinating centre in each country, based on a template provided&#xD;
      by the international coordinating centre (International Diabetes Institute, Australia). The&#xD;
      educational program for the GPs randomised to the intervention arm will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combine didactic and interactive sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Involve opinion leaders, i.e. the national lead investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aim to resolve barriers to practical implementation of guidelines already identified&#xD;
           from previous studies (e.g. discuss starting insulin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Present the evidence for the guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Highlight any conflicts between the guidelines and local prescribing regulations, and&#xD;
           confirm the need to follow the local prescribing regulations in these instances&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Involve an initial educational symposium and a follow-up continuing medical education&#xD;
           symposium at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organisational changes to improve guideline adherence for the study will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Paper or electronic reminders of the guidelines will be sent to GPs every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Desktop reminders cards with key guideline algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Insertion of a flowsheet (diabetes action plan) into the patient's medical notes by the&#xD;
           study nurse (at the time of review of the practitioner's baseline HbA1c utilisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-centred approaches to improve guideline adherence for the study will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Encouragement and empowerment of patients to ask questions of the treating practitioners&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provision of each patient with a &quot;diabetes passport&quot; to be held by the patient, to&#xD;
           encourage discussion between the patient and practitioner and also recording of results&#xD;
           of medical examinations. This will be provided at the baseline visit to the national&#xD;
           coordinating centre.&#xD;
