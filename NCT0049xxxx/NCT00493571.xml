      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gimatecan is designed to block the function of an important protein (topoisomerase I) in&#xD;
      cancer cells that helps repair damage to DNA (the genetic material of cells). When this&#xD;
      protein is blocked, cancer cells may die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start receiving the study drug, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, and temperature), height, and&#xD;
           weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (a performance status evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any medications you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 2 teaspoons) or&#xD;
           urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate performed. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an&#xD;
           area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is&#xD;
           withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a bone marrow biopsy when you have&#xD;
           the bone marrow aspirate done. To collect a bone marrow biopsy, an area of the hip is&#xD;
           numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through&#xD;
           a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire to see how the disease may be affecting your ability&#xD;
           to do your daily activities. The questionnaire will take about 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the amount of study drug you&#xD;
      receive will be based on when you join the study. Three (3) to 6 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study and given a certain dose. If they do not experience intolerable side&#xD;
      effects, the next 3-6 participants enrolled will receive a higher dose. This process will&#xD;
      continue until researchers find the highest dose of the drug that can be given without&#xD;
      causing serious or intolerable side effects. The study doctor will tell you what dose you&#xD;
      will be receiving and how this compares to the doses other participants have received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take gimatecan on Days 1-5. On Days 6-28, you will take no study drug. Each 28-day&#xD;
      period is called a study &quot;cycle.&quot; If your doctor thinks it is necessary, your study cycles&#xD;
      may be shortened so that you will receive the study drug more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take the medication on an empty stomach, swallowing the capsules whole. You should&#xD;
      not eat for 1 hour after taking the medication. If you take other medications while you are&#xD;
      on this study, they must be taken 4 hours before or after you take gimatecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests every 1-4 weeks for the&#xD;
      length of this study. Most of these blood tests will be done once a week, but some will only&#xD;
      be done once every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, then every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 1, and then every 9-12 weeks after that, you will have a bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate and/or biopsy. Bone marrow biopsies and aspirates may be collected more often if&#xD;
      your study doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once per week for the first 3 cycles, you will complete a symptom questionnaire. This will be&#xD;
      done either at a study visit, or you will be called by a member of study staff. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will take about 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You can remain on this study for up to 12 months. If, after this time, it is considered that&#xD;
      gimatecan is helping you, the study doctor will discuss the possibility of continuing the&#xD;
      study drug therapy outside of this study. You may be taken off this study early if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off this study, you will have an end-of-study visit, and the following tests&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will repeat the symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Gimatecan is not FDA approved or commercially available. It&#xD;
      has been authorized for use in research only. Up to 30 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with MDS with &gt;/= 5% blasts or IPSS risk group intermediate (1 or 2) or high&#xD;
             (i.e., IPSS score 0.5 or higher).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have failed prior therapy with either chemotherapy (e.g., ara-C-based&#xD;
             chemotherapy, etc) or biologic agents (e.g., hypomethylating agents, arsenic,&#xD;
             thalidomide, CC5013, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, ATG, cyclosporine, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age &gt;/= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on&#xD;
             the use of Gimatecan in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study but will be eligible for future pediatric single-agent trials, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have normal organ function as defined below: 1) Total bilirubin: &lt;/= 1.5&#xD;
             x institutional upper limit of normal; 2) ALT(SGPT): &lt;/= 2.5 x institutional upper&#xD;
             limit of normal; 3) Creatinine: &lt;/= 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The effects of Gimatecan on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential (ie, not&#xD;
             post-menopausal for at least 12 months and not surgically sterile) and men must agree&#xD;
             to use double-barrier contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 3 months following discontinuation of study treatment. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have received only supportive care (transfusions and/or hematopoietic&#xD;
             growth factors) for MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of&#xD;
             the agent in question (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), whichever is greater,&#xD;
             prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered to at least grade 1 from&#xD;
             adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. The use of&#xD;
             hydroxyurea is allowed up to 48 hours prior to the start of therapy with Gimatecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, active uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia requiring and not responding to medical intervention, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
