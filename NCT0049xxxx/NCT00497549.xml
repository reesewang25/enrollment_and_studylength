  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carcinoma esophagus is a common cause of dysphagia. Once dysphagia occurs, a majority of the&#xD;
      tumours are advanced. Most of them would require some form of treatments for control of&#xD;
      dysphagia and to improve the quality of life. Surgery is the only hope for cure. It requires&#xD;
      complete removal of the esophagus. After removal of the esophagus, the stomach can be used as&#xD;
      a substitute for the esophagus. Anastomosis can be done in the neck either by a hand-sewn or&#xD;
      by a stapled anastomosis. The anastomotic leak rates reported in studies comparing hand-sewn&#xD;
      with stapled anastomosis are variable. Many non-randomized studies have reported leak rate as&#xD;
      low as 5% with stapled technique. However, the stricture rate is higher in the stapled group.&#xD;
      There is no randomized study comparing hand-sewn anastomosis with side-to-side stapled&#xD;
      anastomosis. Hence, the investigators planned a randomized trial comparing the anastomotic&#xD;
      sequelae after hand-sewn anastomosis with stapled anastomosis in the neck.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side-to-side stapled anastomosis will decrease anastomotic leak rate by 15% compared to hand&#xD;
      sewn technique in cervical esophagogastric anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following esophagectomy or esophageal bypass, restoration of continuity by gastric&#xD;
      interposition with cervical esophagogastric anastomosis (CEGA) can be done either by a&#xD;
      hand-sewn or stapled anastomosis. Regardless of the surgical approach, decreasing anastomotic&#xD;
      complications is essential for minimizing early morbidity and improving long-term functional&#xD;
      results and quality of life. Cervical esophagogastric anastomosis almost eliminates the risk&#xD;
      of postoperative mediastinitis associated with anastomotic leaks. Further, 98% of CEGA leaks&#xD;
      can be managed successfully with local wound care (1), and less than 2% are associated with&#xD;
      serious complications such as gastric tip necrosis, cervical vertebral osteomyelitis,&#xD;
      epidural abscess and tracheogastroesophageal fistula, etc (2). Though early complications of&#xD;
      CEGA are less, the long-term sequelae such as anastomotic stricture occur in nearly half the&#xD;
      patients with an anastomotic leak. The need for life long esophageal dilatation negates the&#xD;
      benefit of an operation intended to relieve dysphagia. The cause of anastomotic dehiscence in&#xD;
      CEGA is possibly multifactorial (3,4) with both local tissue and systemic factors are being&#xD;
      implicated. As the esophagus has no serosa, its longitudinal muscles hold sutures poorly and&#xD;
      the awkward surgical exposure, possibly contribute to the higher anastomotic leak rates.&#xD;
      Surgical technique is thus likely to play an important role. The incidence of CEGA leakage&#xD;
      with hand sewn has been reported from 15% to 25% (5). While the stapled anastomosis is&#xD;
      considered to be more expedient, less traumatic to tissues, with lower leak rates and&#xD;
      associated with less mortality and morbidity, they are criticized for increased cost and high&#xD;
      stricture rates. Most reports prior to 2000 showed identical leak rates in patients having a&#xD;
      hand-sewn or stapled anastomosis with higher stricture rate in the stapled group (6-8). With&#xD;
      recent technical refinements the CEGA has been performed in side-to-side manner using the&#xD;
      Auto-Suture Endo-GIA 30-3.5 stapler. Following side to side anastomosis the leak rates have&#xD;
      been reported to be less than 5%, with lower incidence of anastomotic stricture after leak&#xD;
      and improved satisfaction in swallowing compared to hand sewn technique (9). These studies&#xD;
      were retrospective and demanded a randomized trial to confirm the results. We therefore&#xD;
      planned a randomized trial comparing the anastomotic sequelae after hand-sewn anastomosis&#xD;
      with mechanical stapled side-to-side anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the rates of anastomotic leaks and postoperative benign stricture after CEGA done&#xD;
      by hand-sewn (end-to-side) technique or by linear stapled anastomosis (side-to-side)&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients who attended outpatient department of GI Surgery with complaints of&#xD;
      dysphagia will be evaluated for esophageal disorder. After confirming the diagnosis of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer and decision of esophagectomy, patients will be included in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria i Any patient with resectable carcinoma of the mid or lower thoracic&#xD;
      esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction. ii Benign esophageal lesion where esophageal&#xD;
      resection was beneficial and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria i Patients who had upper thoracic or cervical esophageal carcinoma ii&#xD;
      Unresectable lesions (T4/M1) iii Prior gastric surgery iv Poor performance status (ECOG 3,4)&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The number of patients to be included was calculated to be 87&#xD;
      patients in each group based on the assumption that anastomotic leak rate will be reduced to&#xD;
      5% using side-to-side stapled anastomosis. The sample size was calculated by the formula for&#xD;
      a power of 80% and alpha error of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be randomly divided into two groups using computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A Hand sewn anastomosis; Group B Stapled anastomosis Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from each patient before entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic work up and preoperative preparation The diagnostic work-up will include barium&#xD;
      swallow, upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy and biopsy (where malignancy was suspected),&#xD;
      hypopharyngoscopy (for corrosive stricture of esophagus), as well as haemogram, serum&#xD;
      chemistry, liver function tests, ECG, chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests. In the&#xD;
      malignant group, preoperative imaging will also include computed tomography (CT) scan from&#xD;
      the neck to the upper abdomen including the liver and celiac axis. Preoperative nutrition&#xD;
      will be maintained and if required a ryle tube or feeding jejunostomy will be done. Incentive&#xD;
      spirometry, steam inhalation, bronchodilators and antibiotics will be used to improve the&#xD;
      pulmonary status as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At surgery, the operative procedures, time taken for anastomosis and total operating time&#xD;
      will be recorded. After surgery, patients will be assessed for anastomotic leakage by a&#xD;
      radiographic contrast (gastrografin) study to be performed on seventh postoperative day.&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage will be defined as a radiological defect at the anastomotic site or&#xD;
      leakage of swallowed fluid out of the drain site or cervical wound. Other complications,&#xD;
      including cardiopulmonary morbidity, septic complications, duration of hospital stay after&#xD;
      surgery and operative mortality will also be studied. Operative mortality included all&#xD;
      patients who will die within 30 days of the procedure or during the same hospital admission.&#xD;
      Anastomotic stricture will be defined as failure to pass the esophagoscope through the&#xD;
      anastomosis or anastomotic narrowing requiring dilatation to relieve dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical approach will be either transhiatal or transthoracic esophagectomy. The gastric&#xD;
      conduit will be prepared based on the right gastric and right gastroepiploic vessels and&#xD;
      pyloromyotomy and pyloroplasty will not performed except in patients with corrosive&#xD;
      strictures. Finger dilatation of pylorus will be done when required. The conduit will be&#xD;
      prepared using 75-mm linear cutter. The stomach will be brought up into the neck through&#xD;
      either the retrosternal or posterior mediastinal route. The CEGA will be done by a&#xD;
      side-to-side stapled or end-to-side hand-sewn method. Chest tubes (32F) will be inserted&#xD;
      bilaterally to take care of any breach in the pleura. Feeding jejunostomy (Witzel's type)&#xD;
      with 12F Malecot's catheter will be done in all patients. The neck wound will be closed&#xD;
      loosely with interrupted 3-0 vicryl sutures over a 14F suction drain and the skin will be&#xD;
      approximated with skin staplers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand-sewn anastomosis: A proper site on the anterior wall of stomach away from the stapled&#xD;
      line approximately 2 cm below the highest point of the gastric conduit will be anastamosed to&#xD;
      esophagus Posterior interrupted seromuscular sutures will be taken with 3-0 silk. The stomach&#xD;
      will then be opened transversely (2.5 to 3 cm long). Interrupted stitches with full thickness&#xD;
      of the stomach and esophagus will be placed to achieve mucosa to mucosa approximation. A 16F&#xD;
      nasogastric tube will then be placed across the anastomosis into the intrathoracic stomach.&#xD;
      The anterior wall of the anastomosis will be completed in a manner similar to posterior wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stapled anastomosis: At least 5 cm of the mobilized stomach will be placed in the neck. Three&#xD;
      interrupted seromuscular sutures will be taken between the posterior wall of the esophagus&#xD;
      and anterior wall of stomach well away from the gastric staple line. A 1.5 cm gastrotomy will&#xD;
      be made. Two stay sutures will then be taken, one at the anterior corner of the esophagus and&#xD;
      another between the posterior corner of esophagus and the middle of the gastrotomy. These&#xD;
      stay sutures will be retracted downwards as the stapler device (using Endopath, EZ45&#xD;
      Endoscopic Linear Cutter) will be introduced, the thinner portion into the stomach and the&#xD;
      thicker staple-bearing portion into the esophagus. The staple cartridge will then be rotated&#xD;
      so that the posterior wall of the esophagus and the anterior wall of the stomach will align&#xD;
      in a parallel manner, keeping the site of the anastomosis well away from the gastric staple&#xD;
      suture line and fire the stapler. A 16F nasogastric tube will be placed across the&#xD;
      anastomosis into the intrathoracic stomach, and the anterior edges of the gastrotomy and open&#xD;
      esophagus will be approximated in two layers with interrupted 3-0 silk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative management: The nasogastric tube will be removed on the 3rd postoperative day.&#xD;
      Jejunostomy trial feed will be started intestinal activity will appear. If there is no&#xD;
      obvious leak, bedside test feeding with water will be done on the 5th postoperative day. If&#xD;
      bedside test feeding shows no leak, oral feeding will be started gradually with water,&#xD;
      banana, curds and soft diet. A contrast study will be done on the 7th postoperative day&#xD;
      unless there is an obvious anastomotic leak. The neck drain will be removed after the&#xD;
      contrast study. If a leak is identified, the cervical wound will be opened to establish&#xD;
      external drainage of any cervical abscess and anastomotic fistulae. Regular dressing with&#xD;
      normal saline soaked gauze will be done. If there is no clinical leak but the contrast study&#xD;
      shows a contained leak (type 1 leak), patients will be managed conservatively without opening&#xD;
      the cervical wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed one week after discharge and at 3-month intervals for the first&#xD;
      two years. Routine clinical examination, hemogram and liver function tests will be done in&#xD;
      all patients. Dysphagia will be assessed with barium swallow and esophagoscopy. Anastomotic&#xD;
      strictures will be dilated with endoscopic or by a Foley catheter balloon (This technique has&#xD;
      been adapted for home based self dilatation) (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be reported as Mean with Standard Error of Mean (SEM). Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be reported as proportions. Student's t test, Chi-square tests and Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test where appropriate will be used for comparison between groups. A p value of 0.05 or&#xD;
      less will be regarded as significant.&#xD;
