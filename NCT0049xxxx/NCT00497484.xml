  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have recently demonstrated resistance to GHRH leading to GH deficiency in patients with&#xD;
      Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (Mantovani et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2003. 88:&#xD;
      4070-4074). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of at least 1-year GH&#xD;
      replacement in these patients. In particular, we will focus our attention on growth velocity&#xD;
      in children affected with this disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Albright's Hereditary Osteodystrophy is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by a&#xD;
      constellation of physical features including short stature, central obesity, round face,&#xD;
      brachydactyly, subcutaneous calcifications and mental retardation. In the same family, it may&#xD;
      present associated to end organ resistance to the action of different hormones, primarily&#xD;
      PTH, TSH and gonadotropins and in this case it is named PHP type Ia, or on the contrary we&#xD;
      may find it as an isolated defect and this is the case of PPHP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In about 80% of affected families, heterozygous loss of function mutations in the Gs alpha&#xD;
      gene are detected. It is of interest mutations inherited from the mother always lead to the&#xD;
      complete form of the disorder, that is PHP; on the contrary when the same mutations are&#xD;
      inherited from the father, patients show the physical abnormalities of Albright's&#xD;
      Osteodystrophy, without any evidence of hormone resistance. This pattern of inheritance is&#xD;
      consistent with a tissue-specific paternal imprinting of the Gs alpha gene. Imprinting is an&#xD;
      epigenetic phenomenon by which one of the 2 alleles undergoes partial or total loss of&#xD;
      expression; in the case of the Gs alpha gene one would expect that only the paternal allele&#xD;
      should be lost in specific endocrine tissues, such as the kidney, the thyroid and the gonad,&#xD;
      which are the target organs resistant to hormone action in PHP Ia. Indeed, our group&#xD;
      demonstrated that in specific human endocrine tissues also Gs alpha transcription mainly&#xD;
      derives from the maternal allele (Mantovani et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2002. 87:&#xD;
      4736-4740). In particular a predominant maternal origin of transcription was found in thyroid&#xD;
      and gonad and these data are consistent with the clinical finding of TSH and gonadotropin&#xD;
      resistance present in patients affected with PHP. Interestingly, we observed a predominance&#xD;
      of the maternal allele also in the pituitary gland, an organ which is not classically&#xD;
      included among the target organs resistant to hormone action in PHP Ia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this observation, we have recently demonstrated resistance to GHRH leading to GH&#xD;
      deficiency in most of our patients with PHP Ia (Mantovani et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab,&#xD;
      2003. 88: 4070-4074). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of at least 1-year&#xD;
      GH replacement in these patients. In particular, we will focus our attention on growth&#xD;
      velocity in children affected with this disease.&#xD;
