  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a combination Phase I/II design that explores the toxicity and activity of Sunitinib&#xD;
      and Dacarbazine (DTIC) for metastatic melanoma. The initial Phase I part of this trial will&#xD;
      consist of a dose escalation of sunitinib while keeping the DTIC dose constant. If no DLT is&#xD;
      seen, this dose will be the suggested Phase II trial dose. If less than 2 disease responses&#xD;
      are seen, patients will not be enrolled any further, and the study will be considered&#xD;
      negative for activity. If a clinical response is seen, patients will continue to be enrolled.&#xD;

      This is a combination Phase I/II design that explores the toxicity and activity of a&#xD;
      combination of sunitinib and Dacarbazine (DTIC) for metastatic melanoma. Screening tests&#xD;
      (pre-study) will consist of a history, physical, CBC, CMP, EKG, pregnancy test for women of&#xD;
      childbearing age, amylase (blood test for diagnoses of pancreatitis or other pancreatic&#xD;
      diseases), staging CT, and PK. Also, on day 1, these tests will be repeated - a history,&#xD;
      physical, toxicity assessment, CBC, and amylase test. Re-staging tests will be performed&#xD;
      after 2 complete cycles and follow up as indicated clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial Phase I part of this trial will consist of a dose escalation of sunitinib while&#xD;
      keeping the DTIC dose constant. Sunitinib will be given 2 weeks on and 1 week off with DTIC&#xD;
      given once every 21 days for one cycle. If no DLT is seen, the maximum tolerated sunitinib&#xD;
      dose will be the suggested as the Phase II trial dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be measured after 2 complete cycles. Subsequently, during Phase II the&#xD;
      trial will enroll more patients; if less than 2 responses are seen, patients will not be&#xD;
      enrolled any further, and the study will be considered negative for activity. But, if a&#xD;
      clinical response is seen, more patients will be enrolled at the Phase II dose.&#xD;
