  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of group counseling for cancer patients:&#xD;
      Meaning-Centered counseling and Supportive counseling. Many cancer patients seek counseling&#xD;
      to help with the emotional burden of their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with&#xD;
      cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. &quot;Meaning-Centered&quot; group counseling&#xD;
      is intended to teach cancer patients how to maintain or even increase a sense of meaning and&#xD;
      purpose in their lives, despite cancer. &quot;Supportive&quot; group counseling is intended to help you&#xD;
      cope with cancer by giving you a place to express your feelings and get support from other&#xD;
      cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of&#xD;
      counseling approaches for cancer patients.&#xD;

      To conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of Meaning-Centered Group&#xD;
      Psychotherapy (MCGP) versus a standardized Supportive Group Psychotherapy (SGP) in reducing&#xD;
      psychological distress (depression and anxiety), end-of-life despair (hopelessness, desire&#xD;
      for hastened death, and suicidal ideation), and improving spiritual well-being and overall&#xD;
      quality of life in a sample patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the relative impact of Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy on different aspects of&#xD;
      spiritual well-being (e.g., a sense of meaning and purpose versus spirituality linked to&#xD;
      religious faith).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine clinical and demographic variables that may correspond to differential responses&#xD;
      to Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy (e.g., potential mediating and moderating influences&#xD;
      such as illness severity, religion and religiosity, level of education, race/ethnicity, level&#xD;
      of pre-intervention social support, presence of pain and physical symptom burden).&#xD;
