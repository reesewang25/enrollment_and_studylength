      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the efficacy (according to the International Working Group response criteria&#xD;
      for Hodgkin's Lymphomas [7, 8, 9]) of daily oral doses of ITF2357 administered to very&#xD;
      high-risk Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of ITF2357&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the proportion of patients that, after ITF2357 treatment, can undergo&#xD;
           high-dose salvage chemotherapy with either autografting or allografting&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, phase II study testing ITF2357 in a population of very&#xD;
      high-risk relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were planned to receive 50 mg ITF2357 four times a day at 6-hour intervals in&#xD;
      fed conditions for 28 consecutive days unless evidence of progressive disease, presence of&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events or patient's request to discontinue treatment occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision regarding the continuation of ITF2357 were made on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the basis of tumor reassessment upon completion of cycle defined as above and not later&#xD;
           than 7 days and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the occurred toxicity (if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If complete response or partial response or stabilization of disease after first cycle,&#xD;
      without concomitant relevant toxicities is observed, the treatment may continue as long as&#xD;
      there is no evidence of progressive disease or appearance of unacceptable adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case, the treatment is not planned to exceed 84 days of drug intake overall (i.e. 12&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is planned to be administered on an outpatient basis and patients are planned&#xD;
      to be followed regularly with physical and laboratory tests, as specified in the protocol; in&#xD;
      case of hospitalization, the treatment will be continued or interrupted according to the&#xD;
      Investigators' decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study planned to accrue 23 patients evaluable for efficacy and the anticipated duration&#xD;
      of the study is about 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, accrual was stopped earlier than planned by the Sponsor for 2 main reasons: a) a&#xD;
      very slow recruitment rate; b) an unplanned interim analysis suggesting a lower than&#xD;
      estimated efficacy of the drug when delivered as single agent.&#xD;
