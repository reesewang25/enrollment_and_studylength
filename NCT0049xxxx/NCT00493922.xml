      1) To compare in a setting where microscopy for malaria is available whether introducing&#xD;
      rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) improves targetting of antimalarial drugs and antibiotics (RDT&#xD;
      v microscopy). 2) To compare whether, in a setting where microscopy for malaria is not&#xD;
      available, introducing rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) improves targetting of antimalarial&#xD;
      drugs and antibiotics (RDT v clinical diagnosis).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND There is good evidence from multiple sites, including in Ghana, that malaria is&#xD;
      massively over-diagnosed. It could be argued that where microscopy is not available it can be&#xD;
      introduced, and elsewhere it can be improved, but high-quality microscopy is not easy to&#xD;
      sustain. If substantial over-diagnosis continues in Ghana in an era where an ACT is now the&#xD;
      first-line treatment, it will lead to the intervention being substantially more expensive due&#xD;
      to over-prescription than it should be, potentially rendering it unsustainable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has the potential to provide a way of more&#xD;
      accurately directing ACTs to those that need them and may also encourage clinicians to&#xD;
      consider alternative diagnoses in test-negative cases, reducing the risk of missing&#xD;
      treatable, and potentially fatal, alternative causes of febrile illness. RDTs to direct ACT&#xD;
      use also have the possibility to be cost-effective, but only if clinicians prescribe&#xD;
      logically on the basis of test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial data from Tanzania suggests that providing RDTs in the context of formal healthcare&#xD;
      settings may have little impact on clinician behaviour, but the health system in Ghana is&#xD;
      very different, and both clinician and patient beliefs about malaria are likely to be&#xD;
      different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this has not been properly tested in areas with little or no access to&#xD;
      microscopy, nor where ACTs are currently available, which may influence clinician behaviour.&#xD;
      Many believe this is the most useful setting for RDTs, and may limit over-prescription of&#xD;
      anti-malarials but there are no data to support this belief, nor are there data on the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of this approach. This trial aims to test the impact of RDT use on&#xD;
      clinician behaviour directly by means of a randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Principal Objective To determine by means of a randomized trial the impact of the&#xD;
      introduction of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) on the appropriate prescription of&#xD;
      anti-malarials in the two public healthcare settings found in Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine by means of a randomized trial the impact of introducing RDTs on the&#xD;
           appropriate prescription of anti-malarials in a setting where diagnosis is currently&#xD;
           purely clinical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine by means of a randomized trial the impact of introducing RDTs on the&#xD;
           appropriate prescription of anti-malarials in a setting where microscopy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs in the diagnosis of malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore clinician and patient perceptions on the use of RDTs versus clinical&#xD;
           diagnosis in the management of malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To explore clinician and patient perceptions on the use of RDTs versus microscopy in the&#xD;
           management of malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine the cost-effectiveness of RDTs for diagnosis of malaria in both settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cases RDT is being compared to the standard of care in the health centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The study will be carried out in the Dangme West District in the southern part of&#xD;
      Ghana. It will be an individually randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline data will initially be collected for a period of one month to document the&#xD;
           normal pattern of diagnosing malaria by clinicians in each health facility. At the&#xD;
           health centre, all patients for whom microscopy is requested will have a research slide&#xD;
           taken at the same time and the laboratory results of the clinic slide documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exit interviews with patients and record reviews will be conducted to find out whether&#xD;
           patients had been prescribed an anti-malarial and confirm whether this was done on&#xD;
           clinical grounds or on the basis of microscopy. Their prescriptions will be documented.&#xD;
           At the community clinics as well, a research slide will be taken for all patients with&#xD;
           diagnosis of malaria or who are prescribed an anti-malarial. Record review of the&#xD;
           outpatient department (OPD) cards of all patients with a diagnosis of malaria or who&#xD;
           receive an anti-malarial be carried out to also document presenting symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For the main trial, all patients visiting the health facility and who meet the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria will be eligible for enrolment into the study. Allocations to either microscopy&#xD;
           or RDT at the health centre and to either clinical diagnosis or RDT at the community&#xD;
           clinics will be computer generated. The allocations will be placed in sequentially&#xD;
           numbered sealed opaque envelopes which will be prior-labelled with unique study ID&#xD;
           numbers. Patients will be identified and consent sought on exit from the consulting&#xD;
           room. If the clinician requests a laboratory test, the patient will be sent to the&#xD;
           laboratory where a research assistant will open the sealed envelope in the presence of&#xD;
           the patient to find out their allocation. The allocated test will be carried out and a&#xD;
           research slide taken at the same time. The lab results will be written out as usual in&#xD;
           the case of microscopy and the dipstick results will be recorded and sent to the&#xD;
           clinician for reading as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the community clinics where there is no laboratory, the process of identification of&#xD;
           eligible patients, seeking of consent and allocation of study arm will be similar to&#xD;
           that of the health centre. However, in this setting, depending on the allocation in the&#xD;
           sealed envelope, a rapid diagnostic test will either be carried out by a research&#xD;
           assistant or a printed card with &quot;clinical diagnosis&quot; written on it will be given to the&#xD;
           patient. In the case of the RDT, the results will be recorded before the dipstick is&#xD;
           sent to the clinician for clinician-read diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Whether the&#xD;
           patient is assigned to clinical diagnosis or RDT, a research assistant will prepare a&#xD;
           research slide per patient and air dry them for later batch reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The presenting symptoms, temperature at presentation, laboratory results, clinician's&#xD;
           diagnoses and treatment of all patients recruited into the study will be documented.&#xD;
           Prescriptions given to them will be documented on exit. In addition, their contact&#xD;
           addresses will be collected on exit and consent sought to facilitate their easy location&#xD;
           and recruitment for focus group discussions later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The gold standard for whether a child or adult has malaria will be slide-proven malaria&#xD;
           parasitaemia measured by a double-read research slide. Research slides will be Giemsa&#xD;
           stained and read by two independent microscopists who would be blind to the study&#xD;
           allocations and test results. They will not be used by clinicians in their treatment&#xD;
           decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. At the end of the trial, individual in-depth interviews will be conducted with the main&#xD;
           clinicians and focus group discussions held with all the other clinicians of the&#xD;
           participating health facilities. The aim will be to explore their perceptions with&#xD;
           regard to the use of clinical diagnosis, microscopy and RDT in the diagnosis of malaria&#xD;
           and their practices with regards to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. A random selection of patients from the three health facilities will be contacted to&#xD;
           participate in focus group discussions at the end of the trial. There will be at least&#xD;
           two focus group discussions comprising 8-12 discussants each from each health facility.&#xD;
           These discussions will be carried out by means of interview guides. The discussions will&#xD;
           be conducted in the local language and recorded on a tape recorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both settings data will be collected for the cost-effectiveness studies.&#xD;
