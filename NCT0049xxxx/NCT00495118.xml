      The purpose of this study is to document the long-term safety of 25, 37.5, or 50 mg&#xD;
      long-acting injectable risperidone given via injection to the gluteal muscle every 2 weeks to&#xD;
      subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Noncompliance in taking medication is very common among people with schizophrenia, and is a&#xD;
      frequent cause of relapse of symptoms. A long-acting injectable formulation that ensures slow&#xD;
      but steady release of risperidone over a period of several weeks would eliminate the need to&#xD;
      take medication on a daily basis, and improve compliance. This is an open-label,&#xD;
      international, multicenter study in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
      who completed the risperidone microspheres arm of study RIS-INT-62, or who completed study&#xD;
      RIS-INT-85, or who dropped out of the risperidone microspheres arm of study RIS-INT-62 due to&#xD;
      treatment with 75 mg long-acting injectable risperidone. Patients have to begin this study&#xD;
      within 7 days of the final visit in the RIS-INT-62 or RIS-INT-85 studies. The end point visit&#xD;
      of the RIS-INT-62 or RIS-INT-85 study serves as the first visit of this open-label study.&#xD;
      Patients can start this study on the same dose as the last risperidone microsphere injection&#xD;
      that they received in the previous study, or at a dose that was 12.5 mg lower or higher than&#xD;
      the previously received dose. Patients who received 75 mg risperidone microsphere injection&#xD;
      during study RIS-INT-62 can continue on this dose but an attempt will be made to decrease the&#xD;
      dose to 50 mg within 3 months. The total study duration is planned to be at least 1 year or&#xD;
      until approval of long-acting injectable risperidone in the respective country. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that treatment with the long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone every&#xD;
      2 weeks for at least 1 year will be safe and well tolerated, as assessed by adverse event&#xD;
      reporting, the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale, laboratory tests, vital signs&#xD;
      measurements, physical examinations, body weight measurements, electrocardiograms, and&#xD;
      injection site evaluations. Patients will receive injections of risperidone depot&#xD;
      microspheres (25, 37.5, 50, or 75 mg) in their gluteal muscle at 2-weekly intervals for at&#xD;
      least 1 year.&#xD;
