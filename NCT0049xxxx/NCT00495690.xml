      Title: Impact of daily zinc supplementation to infants born with low birth weight on&#xD;
      mortality and severe disease requiring hospitalization Background: Zinc supplementation was&#xD;
      shown to prevent diarrhea and pneumonia in 6 month to 3 year old children. Little is known&#xD;
      about the impact of zinc supplementation of low birth weight (LBW) babies during first 6&#xD;
      months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objectives were to determine the impact of daily zinc administration at 1RDA&#xD;
      (5 mg) of elemental zinc to LBW infants on severe morbidity requiring hospitalization and on&#xD;
      all cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial 2012 hospital-born infants with&#xD;
      a birth weight &lt;2500 g were randomly assigned to receive zinc or placebo for 6 months. Zinc&#xD;
      group received 5 mg elemental zinc as acetate daily from 4 weeks age. Cause specific&#xD;
      hospitalization deaths, episodes of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, other illness,&#xD;
      visits to health care providers and hospital OPDs were ascertained by in-depth interview and&#xD;
      from documents like prescriptions, hospital tickets, medicine cartons at 3 and 6 months of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Number of infants with one or more diarrhea episodes was less by 17% (95% CI: 1% to&#xD;
      35%) in the zinc group but the numbers for ARI were similar in the two groups. The&#xD;
      hospitalization rates due to all causes or diarrhea or ARI were similar in the two groups.&#xD;
      Twelve in the zinc group and 9 in the placebo group died during 4 weeks to 6 months (p=0.36).&#xD;
      We observed no significant difference for gain in weight and length at 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      between the groups. In a subgroup of infants the mean serum zinc concentration in the zinc&#xD;
      group was 27% higher (p=0.004) than the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Hospital born, low birth weight infants do not seem to derive worthwhile benefit&#xD;
      from daily zinc supplementation of recommended dietary allowance for zinc in terms of&#xD;
      morbidity and growth during first six months of life.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.To determine the impact of daily administration of 1 RDA (5 mg) of elemental zinc to LBW&#xD;
      infants from 4 weeks to 6 months of life on all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii.To determine the impact of zinc supplementation on severe morbidity requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.The prevalence of LBW is high in Asia, particularly in South Asian countries like India,&#xD;
      Pakistan and Bangladesh. LBW infants have a high neonatal and infant mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii.A recent preliminary study showed that zinc supplementation of LBW infants reduced&#xD;
      mortality (Sazawal et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii.A targeted intervention in LBW infants starting at about 4 weeks of age is&#xD;
      programmatically highly attractive. It can be combined with immunization program and with&#xD;
      recent recommendation to give iron and folate to infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv.The fact that mortality rate is very high in LBW infants means a relatively smaller study&#xD;
      will give us results suitable for a policy decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and location:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infants were recruited at birth at the maternity ward of M.R. Bangur General Hospital&#xD;
      where more than 6000 deliveries take place in a year. Located in Kolkata this hospital serves&#xD;
      a district of West Bengal. Preliminary data collected by us from four hospitals in West&#xD;
      Bengal showed that little over 37% of the babies born there have a birth weight of less than&#xD;
      2500 g. Taking conservative estimate of 35% of babies born to be of LBW (&lt; 2500 g), more than&#xD;
      2000 LBW babies are expected to be born at this hospital in a year. LBW infants born at this&#xD;
      hospital was recruited in this study and followed up at home. Mainly the urban and peri-urban&#xD;
      poor use these Government hospitals. The hospital services are rendered free of charge by the&#xD;
      Government.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One preliminary zinc supplementation trial in small-for-date infants reported as high as 67%&#xD;
      reduction in the mortality rate with zinc supplementation between 2 and 9 months of age. We&#xD;
      consider this effect as highly optimistic. Therefore, we calculated the required sample size&#xD;
      based on more conservative estimates at various levels of expected reduction in mortality&#xD;
      rate associated with zinc supplementation of LBW infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking a figure of infant mortality rate of 40/100 in LBW infants and assuming that at least&#xD;
      50% of these deaths occurred between 4 weeks and 6 months of age. We expect 20 deaths per 100&#xD;
      infants during the observation period for this study. Assuming a reduction in the mortality&#xD;
      rate by 35% with 95% confidence and 80% power, we need a total sample size of 970 infants,&#xD;
      which includes 10% excess to account for deviated course (e.g. Loss to follow-up, withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent). Assuming a mortality rate reduction of 30% with similar assumption the total&#xD;
      (plus 10% for deviated courses) sample size should be 1360 in LBW infants. If we expect a&#xD;
      reduction in mortality rate by 25%, the total sample size would be 1900 infants which include&#xD;
      10% for deviated course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight at birth less than 2500 g&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infant is likely to stay in the city for the next 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Absence of gross congenital malformation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perinatal illness requiring hospital stay after birth for more than 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Written informed consent was not provided by parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presence of gross congenital anomaly&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Resides at a distance that makes it difficult to reach for home visit (estimated time to&#xD;
           reach in more than 3 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were ascertained and those eligible were considered for inclusion into&#xD;
      the study. The child visited the clinic or a home visit was made at 3-4 weeks by a team of&#xD;
      health workers and if still alive the infant was randomly assigned to the zinc or to the&#xD;
      placebo group. A master randomization code was prepared by using permuted blocks of random&#xD;
      numbers using block lengths of 4, 6 and 8. This code was held by a person not involved with&#xD;
      the study who numbered the bottles containing the formulation or placebo for each child&#xD;
      according to the randomization chart and the bottles were labeled only with the serial&#xD;
      numbers of the child in the study. The final code was kept with a person not involved with&#xD;
      the study. The zinc syrup and the placebo were similar in appearance, consistency and taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each infant in the study received placebo or 5 mg of elemental zinc (1 RDA) as zinc acetate&#xD;
      syrup daily from 4 weeks of age. For routine immunization and other care, parents were&#xD;
      advised to attend the baby clinic of the same hospital or another hospital in the locality.&#xD;
      In case of any reported or detected illness by the field workers, free drugs were provided&#xD;
      and hospitalization facilitated when required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that 80% of the LBW babies can be realistically included in the study. We have&#xD;
      earlier estimated that approximately a little over 2000 LBW babies were born in a year in&#xD;
      each hospital. We recruited a total of 2012 infants, 1005 in the zinc group and 1007 in the&#xD;
      placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining an informed verbal consent, the infant eligible for enrollment at the&#xD;
      maternity ward was escorted home by a health worker to note the exact location of their stay.&#xD;
      The mother was advised to bring the infant to the hospital at 4 weeks where baseline&#xD;
      information on the infant were recorded and 8 weeks' supply of the zinc/placebo formulation&#xD;
      was provided to the parents with instruction for use. The mother, under supervision, gave the&#xD;
      first dose at the clinic. If the mother did not return at 4 weeks after birth, field workers&#xD;
      were visited home and the medicine was provided as above. The field workers visited the home&#xD;
      8 weeks later recorded the events about the infant and provided another 8 weeks to medicine.&#xD;
      After 16 weeks of medication, the infant visited the clinic or a field visit was made to&#xD;
      ascertain the state of the infant and was provided with 8 weeks of medication and evaluation&#xD;
      was recorded, after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of study outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death if any was recorded at each contact. The cause of death was ascertained by a verbal&#xD;
      autopsy. Available hospital records were examined and a team of pediatricians independently&#xD;
      reviewed verbal autopsy questionnaires. The diagnosis was made by consensus or through&#xD;
      discussion. Similarly, illness events requiring hospitalization were documented at each&#xD;
      contact. A questionnaire was used and hospital records examined, including all prescriptions.&#xD;
      At each contact either at the clinic or at home, the details of illness events and treatment&#xD;
      received were recorded in a standardized data forms and documentations such as prescriptions,&#xD;
      medicine bottles or cartons were physically checked and recorded. Anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      were recorded at 3 and 6 months of receiving the medicines. All documentations on morbidity&#xD;
      were evaluated at fortnightly meetings of the health workers with the two pediatricians&#xD;
      involved the study (DM &amp; AS) and the cause's of hospital admissions, deaths and morbidities&#xD;
      were reviewed and a diagnosis was made &amp; recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from the parents. Ethics Review Committee of the&#xD;
      Society for Applied Studies, Kolkata approved the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were entered into a desktop computer and edited using a software EPI Info (CDC,&#xD;
      Atlanta, USA and WHO, Geneva) and analyzed by EPI Info and another software named Stata&#xD;
      (Stata Corporation, Texas, USA). The main comparison was between those who received zinc and&#xD;
      those who received placebo. Baseline information was compared to evaluate the comparability&#xD;
      of the two groups. These include socio-economic variables, type of delivery, gestation, birth&#xD;
      weight, breast-feeding status etc. The two groups were compared for all-cause mortality. The&#xD;
      proportion of infants having illness requiring hospitalization in the two groups was&#xD;
      compared. For this comparison, only the first episode requiring hospitalization in a&#xD;
      particular infant was considered. Although the follow-up period would be very similar, some&#xD;
      degree of variable follow-up was expected which was addressed by using person-time&#xD;
      calculation between 4 weeks and end of the study. The analysis was based on&#xD;
      intention-to-treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 20,248 neonates were evaluated for eligibility at the maternity ward of MR Bangur&#xD;
      Hospital of whom 5,942 had &lt;2,500g weight. A total of 2,012 infants were admitted into the&#xD;
      study, 1,005 being in the zinc group and 1,007 in the placebo group. A total of 909 infants&#xD;
      in the zinc group and 913 in the placebo group completed 6 months of follow-up. The birth&#xD;
      weight, type of delivery, birth order and mothers education were comparable in the two&#xD;
      groups. Weight, length, head and midarm circumference at 3 and 6 months were similar in the&#xD;
      two groups. In a subgroup of infants' blood hemoglobin levels were determined on completion&#xD;
      of the study and the mean values in the two groups were similar. In a subgroup of infants&#xD;
      zinc supplemented group should a substantially higher mean zinc concentration compared to&#xD;
      placebo. The numbers of deaths in the two groups were not significantly different.&#xD;
      Hospitalization rates with diarrhea, ARI and all causes are similar in the two groups. The&#xD;
      number of infants with one or more episodes of diarrhea was significantly less among zinc&#xD;
      supplemented group (by 17%, 95% CI:1 to 35 %). The number of infants with one or more&#xD;
      episodes of acute respiratory infection was similar in two groups (p=0.76).&#xD;
