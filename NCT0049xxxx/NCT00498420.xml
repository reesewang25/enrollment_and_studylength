      The natural history study of the rare lysosomal disease alpha-mannosidosis will answer the&#xD;
      question; why the rare disease develops as it does?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human alpha-mannosidosis is a rare genetic disorder, caused by the lack of lysosomal&#xD;
      alpha-mannosidase, resulting in mental retardation, skeletal changes, hearing loss and&#xD;
      recurrent infections. The lack of alpha-mannosidase causes a disorder of glycoprotein&#xD;
      catabolism associated with abnormal levels and excretion of small mannose-rich&#xD;
      oligosaccharides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha-mannosidosis belongs to a group of lysosomal storage disorders that includes more than&#xD;
      50 different diseases, with a cumulative frequency of about 1:10.000 world wide. The&#xD;
      incidence of alpha-mannosidase disease has been estimated to be 1 in 500.000 (Australian and&#xD;
      Norwegian study). The disease is not specific to any ethnic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology and Pathogenesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lysosomal alpha-mannosidase (LAMAN), in the following called mannosidase, is an enzyme that&#xD;
      cleaves alpha-mannosidic linkages during the ordered degradation of oligosaccharides. Only&#xD;
      after degradation, can the sugars leave the lysosomes, the cell and later the body. The&#xD;
      deficiency in mannosidase activity causes a block in the degradation of glycoproteins&#xD;
      resulting in lysosomal accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharide chains. Consequently,&#xD;
      these sugars accumulate in the lysosomes as they are too large to leave. Finally, the&#xD;
      lysosomes increase in size, producing vacuoles and impaired cellular function is induced by&#xD;
      an unknown mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affected children are usually born apparently normal and their condition worsens&#xD;
      progressively without any possible treatment available to prevent this evolution. The&#xD;
      clinical findings in alpha-mannosidosis include a broad range of symptoms, from an early&#xD;
      lethal form to less symptomatic, chronic forms often initially diagnosed in childhood.&#xD;
      Alpha-mannosidosis is frequently associated with corneal opacities, aseptic destructive&#xD;
      arthritis, metabolic myopathy and immune deficiency. In the past alpha-mannosidosis was&#xD;
      classified into two forms. A more severe infantile (type 1) phenotype that include rapid,&#xD;
      progressive mental retardation; hepatosplenomegaly; severe dysostosis multiplex; and often&#xD;
      death between 3 and 12 years of age. The juvenile-adult phenotype (type 2) is characterized&#xD;
      by a milder and more slowly progressive course with survival into adulthood. The distinctions&#xD;
      are not absolute, and symptoms and lethality may vary. In affected children that are born&#xD;
      healthy, there is a window of opportunity for a therapy initiated at an early age to&#xD;
      contribute to normal development and the prevention of other disease related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the short-term, natural history of subjects diagnosed with Alpha-Mannosidosis To&#xD;
      establish the range and diversity of clinical symptomatology To evaluate short term (24&#xD;
      months) changes in disease parameters&#xD;
