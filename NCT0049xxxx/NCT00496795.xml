      Aim The scientific aim of this study is to explore mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy&#xD;
      in breast cancer. To do so, we explore molecular parameters predicting response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy in large, primary breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Neoadjuvant (primary medical) therapy has got wide acceptance as primary therapy&#xD;
      in breast cancer. In addition, this treatment provides an optimal setting studying the&#xD;
      mechanisms of drug resistance in human cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering chemotherapy for primary breast cancer treatment, contemporary trend has been to&#xD;
      treat these tumors more aggressively. High-dose therapy involving stem cell support is not&#xD;
      advocated, as this has not been shown to improve long-term survival in early breast cancer.&#xD;
      However, the attitude in general has been toward a more aggressive approach within the frame&#xD;
      of &quot;conventional&quot; therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on theoretical modeling, an alternative approach, &quot;dose-dense&quot; therapy, has been&#xD;
      advocated. Recently, that concept was brought to the test in two adjuvant trials. Thus,&#xD;
      Citron et al applying doxorubicin, paclitaxel and cyclofosfamide revealed an improved outcome&#xD;
      for dose-dense (2-weekly) administration compared to regular 3-weekly scheduling. In&#xD;
      contrast, the German GEPARDUO study reported doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide and docetaxel,&#xD;
      given in sequence on a 3-weekly basis (8 cycles), to be superior to doxorubicin and docetaxel&#xD;
      given in concert on a 2-weekly basis for 4 cycles. However, the doses administered&#xD;
      (doxorubicin 50 versus 60 mg/m2; docetaxel 75 versus 100 mg/m2) was unequal, meaning total&#xD;
      drug dose exposure differed between the two treatment arms. While more data are warranted, a&#xD;
      reasonable interpretation of available data suggest sequential administration of different&#xD;
      compounds in a dose-density approach to be a suitable regimen provided adequate total doses&#xD;
      are given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for regimen Considering anthracyclines, most regimens today combine either&#xD;
      epirubicin or doxorubicin in concert with 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. However, based&#xD;
      on the evidence in the literature, it is not clear what the contribution of 5-FU or&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide is to the effectiveness of such regimens, in particular not when a taxane is&#xD;
      administered in sequence or concert. Thus, the NSABP-group has abandoned use of 5-FU from&#xD;
      their adjuvant regimen. Considering cyclophosphamide, this compound seems to add to the&#xD;
      carcinogenetic effect of anthracyclines enhancing the risk of secondary leukemia, while the&#xD;
      contribution to the antitumor efficacy of the regimen remains uncertain. The taxanes are&#xD;
      known to have significant antitumor effects in breast cancer when administered as&#xD;
      monotherapy. Considering docetaxel, the dose generally advocated for monotherapy is 100&#xD;
      mg/m2, while a dose of 75mg/m2 is recommended for combined use. Thus, the potential exists&#xD;
      that the dose for combined use may be sub-optimal in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for a sequential approach is further supported by studies in metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific aims While many mechanisms of resistance have been identified in experimental&#xD;
      systems, we have little knowledge what may be the cause of drug resistance in human cancers.&#xD;
      The factors so far identified that have been found associated with resistance to chemotherapy&#xD;
      in breast cancer are amplification of HER-2 / Topo-II and mutations affecting TP53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several groups have explored responsiveness to chemotherapy using mRNA microarrays.&#xD;
      While these studies consistently identified different gene profiles correlating to&#xD;
      responsiveness to different regimens, the predictive value was too low for clinical&#xD;
      application. Moreover, the results did not add to our understanding of the biological&#xD;
      mechanisms causing drug resistance. In contrast, studies exploring different forms of cancer&#xD;
      have started to reveal specific gene alterations, in particular affecting pathways of DNA&#xD;
      damage repair or apoptosis in relation to drug resistance. Thus, our primary aim is to&#xD;
      explore potential gene disturbances based on functional hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major issue identifying mechanisms of drug resistance is to explore different compounds on&#xD;
      a monodrug basis. Clinically, the major reason for combining or administering sequentially an&#xD;
      anthracycline and a taxane is the efficacy of each compound combined with a significant lack&#xD;
      of cross-resistance. Administered as a combined schedule, this limits the possibility of&#xD;
      identifying the mechanisms of resistance / sensitivity to each compound individually.&#xD;
      Provided that a sequential regimen provides the same efficacy as a combined schedule, such an&#xD;
      approach is justified ethically. Thus, for a patient given 2 and 3 drugs in concert, the&#xD;
      potential may be they respond to one drug only, while having the toxicity of the other&#xD;
      compounds. In case of non-responsiveness to a single compound, this may be exchanged for an&#xD;
      alternative treatment option. This contrasts the possibilities provided in the adjuvant&#xD;
      setting. In adjuvant therapy, there is no way by which we may assess the response to&#xD;
      individual drugs; thus the different compounds have to administer in concert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on what is said above, we consider sequential dose-dense treatment using epirubicin and&#xD;
      docetaxel sequentially to be a feasible treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimen Each patient will receive 4 cycles of epirubicin 60 mg/m2 given at 2 weekly&#xD;
      intervals together with G-CSF. Thereafter, docetaxel 100 mg/ m2 will be given at 2 weekly&#xD;
      intervals for 4 cycles. Patients revealing positivity for HER2 status will have trastuzumab&#xD;
      (Herceptin) implemented together with docetaxel but not during anthracycline treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staging at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      After given informed consent, patients will be staged as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI of both breasts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver ultrasound (in case metastases are suspected or verified; to be followed by CT and&#xD;
           / or MRI confirmation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skeletal scintigram. Any positive findings to be confirmed by subsequent X-ray / CT and&#xD;
           / or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response evaluation Response will be evaluated based on clinical examination and MRI, each&#xD;
      assessment to be done separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination will be performed prior to commencing therapy (before surgical biopsy)&#xD;
      and subsequently at 4, 6 and 8 weeks on therapy. Response will be classified according to the&#xD;
      common &quot;RECIST&quot; criteria. An important exception is to be made. As argued in a previous&#xD;
      protocol, we consider the RECIST definition of &quot;progressive disease&quot; as a 20% increase in the&#xD;
      sum of the largest tumor diameters to be too liberal with respect to large primary tumors.&#xD;
      Based on experience in our clinic, we believe the definition of progressive disease as an&#xD;
      increase of &gt; 25% in the product of the largest tumor diameter and its perpendicular (the&#xD;
      previous common UICC criteria) to be a more suitable definition, protecting patients from&#xD;
      undergoing deterioration of their clinical condition. This is in accordance to our previous&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of &quot;progressive disease&quot; at any stage during epirubicin treatment, the patient will&#xD;
      terminate epirubicin immediately and go ahead with docetaxel treatment. In case of&#xD;
      progressive disease on docetaxel treatment, further therapy is left to the physician's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering MRI assessment, this should be performed prior to commencing therapy, in the&#xD;
      interval following the 4th cycle of epirubicin (prior to commencing docetaxel) and after the&#xD;
      4th cycle of docetaxel, prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each patient will undergo a surgical biopsy prior to commencing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Tru-cut biopsy should be obtained 24 hours after administration of the first&#xD;
           epirubicin cycle to assess &quot;immediate&quot; alterations in response to cytotoxic damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immediately prior to commencing treatment with docetaxel, a third sample (this time a&#xD;
           Tru-Cut biopsy) is obtained for snap-freezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A Tru-cut biopsy should be obtained 24 hours after administration of the first docetaxel&#xD;
           cycle to assess &quot;immediate&quot; alterations in response to cytotoxic damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Finally, tumor tissue is collected and snap-frozen at surgery following docetaxel&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspiration A single unilateral bone marrow aspiration is performed prior to&#xD;
      commencing chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary endpoint is to correlate molecular parameters to objective response to each of&#xD;
           the 2 regimens applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary endpoint are&#xD;
&#xD;
           : - to correlate molecular parameters to relapse-free and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify and explore characteristics of epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
           isolated in tumor tissue and bone marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery While many centers practice breast conservative surgery for tumors successfully&#xD;
      downstaged by primary medical treatment, in general we have applied a conservative approach,&#xD;
      advocating mastectomy. However, downstaging for limited surgery is not a primary or secondary&#xD;
      endpoint of this study. In general, we will advocate mastectomy also for patients with a&#xD;
      clinical complete response. However, this practice may change based on contemporary results&#xD;
      from other centers, and the protocol allow limited surgery at the physicians discretion in&#xD;
      individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Investigations The area of molecular biology is rapidly developing with respect to&#xD;
      biological knowledge as well as technical analytical methods. Thus, it is not possible to&#xD;
      predict upfront which genes may be of particular interest in 5 years from know; neither is it&#xD;
      possible to foresee completely which laboratory methods will be available. Our aim is to&#xD;
      explore potential genetic alterations explaining the mechanisms of drug resistance. While it&#xD;
      is not possible to predict in detail, the aim of the study and all analysis to be conducted&#xD;
      should aim at this major goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients to be enrolled The study is an exploratory translational study. Thus, we&#xD;
      do not know the number of patients expected to achieve a clinical or pathological complete&#xD;
      response. Currently, on average 20 patients are referred to our Department for a diagnosis of&#xD;
      locally advanced breast cancer on an annual basis; including patients with tumors measuring&#xD;
      between 4 and 5 cm in diameter, we estimate the total number may be somewhere between 30 and&#xD;
      40 patients per year. From this cohort, we estimate an average number of 20 patients to be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study on an annual basis. Our aim is to recruit 100 patients with a minimum&#xD;
      of 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Our aim is to publish the results from this study in peer-reviewed international&#xD;
      journals with contributors from the clinic and laboratory as authors.&#xD;
