      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute lung injury (ALI) occasionally occurs after pulmonary resection and carries a bad&#xD;
      prognosis with a high mortality rate ranging from 20 to 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate pre-, intra- and postoperative changes in hemodynamics, oxygenation indices&#xD;
           as well as intra- and extravascular lung water using simple thermodilution technique and&#xD;
           continuous arterial pressure analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to test the efficacy of inhaled beta2 -adrenergic agonist versus anticholinergic agents&#xD;
           to reduce lung edema in patients undergoing thoracic surgery and in pigs subjected to&#xD;
           lipolysacharide-induced ALI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the research protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective controlled trial including surgical patients with high risk factors for ALI&#xD;
           (n=60) allocated to receive inhaled drugs (randomised, double-blind, cross-over mode).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-thoracic blood volume, intra- and extra-vascular lung water, hemodynamic parameters&#xD;
      (CO, systolic arterial pressure/flow variations, dPmax, MAP, CVP), oxygenation indices&#xD;
      (PaO2/FIO2), ventilatory parameters, clinical outcome data, histochemical and pathological&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glossary CO = cardiac output; dPmax = maximal arterial pressure slope; SAP-V = systolic&#xD;
      arterial pressure variations; Flow-V = Flow variations; MAP = mean arterial pressure; CVP =&#xD;
      central venous pressure; PaO2=arterial oxygen pressure; FIO2= oxygen inspiratory fraction&#xD;

      Material and Methods Patient selection Consecutive patients who require elective lung&#xD;
      resection for cancer at the University Hospital of Geneva will be screened for the presence&#xD;
      of risk factors for postoperative ALI or hydrostatic lung edema: age &gt; 60 yrs, history of&#xD;
      chronic alcohol consumption (&gt;60g/day), prior radiation or chemotherapy, cardiac&#xD;
      insufficiency (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%, or a history of past acute heart&#xD;
      failure), coronary artery disease (history of myocardial infarct, Q wave on the ECG, positive&#xD;
      stress test or coronary angiogram), recent pneumonia (within 6 weeks of hospital admission),&#xD;
      reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO &lt; 60% of predicted values) and predicted&#xD;
      postoperative lung perfusion of &lt; 55% of total lung perfusion. Patients with at least 3 risk&#xD;
      factors for postoperative lung edema will be considered eligible for the study. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing pneumonectomy or presenting with intracardiac shunts, valvular diseases or aortic&#xD;
      abdominal aneurysm will all be excluded as these conditions preclude valid measurements of&#xD;
      extravascular lung water volumes. In addition, chronic treatment with inhaled&#xD;
      bronchodilators, a history of any adverse reaction to bronchodilators and liver or kidney&#xD;
      insufficiencies will be considered exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized double blind, cross-over study has been approved by the local university&#xD;
      hospital ethics committee and written informed consent has been obtained from all selected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same team of pneumonologists, thoracic surgeons and anesthesiologists/intensive care&#xD;
      physicians will be involved in the perioperative medical management. In addition to history&#xD;
      and clinical examination, a standardized preoperative assessment includes chest radiography,&#xD;
      ECG, pulmonary function testing as well as computed tomography scans and positron emission&#xD;
      tomographies of the chest, abdomen and brain. Quantitative lung perfusion/ventilation&#xD;
      scanning, brain imaging, maximal aerobic capacity and myocardial stress testing will be&#xD;
      performed when appropriate in intermediate-to-high risk surgical candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative and anesthetic management Routinely, antimicrobial prophylaxis with cefazoline will&#xD;
      be administered for 24 hours and an epidural catheter was inserted at the 4th-5th or at the&#xD;
      5th-6th vertebral interspace. Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) will be initiated&#xD;
      preoperatively with the administration of bupivacaïne 0.25% and continued postoperatively&#xD;
      with a lower dosage (bupivacaine 0.1%) that was combined with opiates (fentanyl 2 mcg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be equipped with a 4-French femoral artery catheter and an internal jugular&#xD;
      venous line that will be connected to a pulse contour cardiac output monitor (PV2024L;&#xD;
      Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After anesthesia induction, a left sided double-lumen endotracheal tube will be inserted and&#xD;
      pressure support ventilation will be adjusted to optimize gas exchanges and minimize lung&#xD;
      hyperinflation with low tidal volume (5-6 ml/kg), high inspiratory oxygen fraction (50-80%)&#xD;
      and positive end expiratory pressure levels (PEEP, 4-12 cm H2O). Periodically, lung&#xD;
      recruitment maneuvers will also be performed to re-open alveolar collapsed areas. Anesthesia&#xD;
      will be maintained by infusing propofol targeted to achieve bispectral&#xD;
      electroencephalographic values between 40 and 60. Lung resection with systematic lymph node&#xD;
      dissection will be performed through an anterolateral muscle-sparing thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, intravenous crystalloids (Ringer-lactate solution) will be infused at a rate&#xD;
      of 2-3 ml/kg/h and blood losses will be compensated with colloids&#xD;
      (poly(0-2-hydroxy-ethyl)amidon, HAES 6%) and with red blood cell concentrates if the&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels decreased below 80-90 g/L. At the end of surgery, all patients will be&#xD;
      extubated in the operating theater after reversing the residual neuromuscular blockade with&#xD;
      anticholinesterase agents. An active physiotherapy program including incentive spirometry,&#xD;
      deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises and mobilization will be started in the&#xD;
      high-dependency care unit (HDU). A maximal fluid balance of 500 ml per day will be targeted&#xD;
      during the first 48 hours after surgery, by limiting fluid intakes including i.v.&#xD;
      crystalloids (glucose-saline 0.45% 1 ml/kg/h), i.v. colloids (1/1 compensation of fluid&#xD;
      losses through thoracic drains and oral beverages (500 ml on the day of surgery and&#xD;
      1'000-1'200 ml over the next two days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Within the first 36 hours after surgery, patients will received in random order&#xD;
      nebulized salbutamol and nebulized ipratropium bromide at 4 consecutive sessions conducted at&#xD;
      least 6 hours apart (figure 1). The treatment order will be generated from random number&#xD;
      tables by an independent observer and concealed in sealed envelopes. The investigators,&#xD;
      attending physicians and nurses will be blinded to the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 10 minutes, either salbutamol (5 mg diluted in 5 ml normal saline) or ipratropium&#xD;
      bromide (0.5 mg diluted in 5 ml normal saline) will be administered via a Cirrus nebulizer&#xD;
      and a compressor (Wokingham, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements In addition to arterial blood sampling, complete sets of hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements will be performed as shown in figure 1: (a) preoperatively, before and 30 min&#xD;
      after initiation of TEA, (b) 2 and 8 hours after surgery (postoperative day 0, [POD0]),&#xD;
      before and 30 min after administration of salbutamol or ipratropium (6 hours apart in random&#xD;
      order), (c) on the morning of the first postoperative day (POD1) on two consecutive sessions&#xD;
      (6 hours apart in random order), before and 30 min after administration of salbutamol or&#xD;
      ipratropium bromide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac output (CO) and volumetric pulmonary variables will be obtained by the simple&#xD;
      transpulmonary indicator dilution technique. Three consecutive measurements with less than&#xD;
      10% variations will be averaged. A fifteen milliliters bolus of 0.9% saline at 4°C will be&#xD;
      injected through the central venous catheter into the right atrium and the change in&#xD;
      temperature will be measured with the femoral artery thermistor tipped catheter. Using the&#xD;
      mean transit time methods, intrathoracic blood volume, extravascular lung water and global&#xD;
      end-diastolic volume will be calculated and indexed for the patient body weight (ITBVI, EVLWI&#xD;
      and GEDVI, respectively). Heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV) and maximal change in arterial&#xD;
      pressure will be determined by beat-to-beat analysis of the arterial pressure wave. The&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) will be calculated using standard formula. The&#xD;
      ratio of EVLWI to ITBVI will be calculated as an index reflecting the permeability of the&#xD;
      alveolar-capillary barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2 in mmHg) will be measured using a blood gas analyzer (ABL-510&#xD;
      analyzer, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) and will be related to the inspiratory O2 fraction&#xD;
      to express the oxygenation index (PaO2/FIO2). In addition, chest radiograph scores (number of&#xD;
      quadrants with &gt;50% involvement with an alveolar filling process) will be recorded on POD0&#xD;
      (arrival in HDU) and POD1 (end of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome measure will be a reduction in EVLWI within the first 24 hours&#xD;
      after lung surgery. Secondary outcomes will be the PaO2/FIO2 ratio, hemodynamic data and&#xD;
      radiological lung injury score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis A sample size of 20 subjects provides the power (80%) to detect a 20%&#xD;
      difference in EVLWI for a two-sided significance level of  = 0.05; in a preliminary study,&#xD;
      we found a mean value of 9.1 ml/kg for EVLWI with a standard deviation (SD) of 2.2 ml/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be reported as M(SD), median (interquartile) or numbers (percentages). A p value&#xD;
      of &lt; 0.05 was considered significant in all analyses. All data will be analyzed with the SPSS&#xD;
      statistical software (version 9.0, SPP, Chicago, IL). ANOVA for repeated measurements will be&#xD;
      used to compare baseline values (preoperative, POD0 and POD1) followed by Bonferroni post-hoc&#xD;
      tests. Paired and unpaired Student t tests will be used to assess and to compare the effects&#xD;
      of bronchodilators. Furthermore, the correlation between changes in EVLWI, CI, ITBVI and&#xD;
      PaO2/FIO2 will be analyzed by linear regression.&#xD;
