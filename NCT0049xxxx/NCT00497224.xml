  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center phase II study of erlotinib in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      or locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer who have received up to one line of&#xD;
      gemcitabine based chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib in addition to gemcitabine significantly improves overall survival compared to&#xD;
      gemcitabine alone in advanced pancreatic cancer (median overall survival 6.24 vs 5.91 months&#xD;
      respectively). However, combined therapy has not become standard of care due to the modest&#xD;
      absolute benefit. In NSCLC, the optimal efficacy of erlotinib is not in combination with&#xD;
      first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced disease, but as a single agent after cytoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that erlotinib will have activity as a&#xD;
      single agent in advanced pancreatic cancer. The presence of an erlotinib-induced rash is&#xD;
      associated with improved survival in phase II and III trials of diverse tumor types (reviewed&#xD;
      by Perez-Soler et al.), and is associated with higher steady state concentrations of&#xD;
      erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II trial aims to determine the safety and efficacy of erlotinib in patients with&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer who have previously been treated with up to one prior line of&#xD;
      gemcitabine based chemotherapy for advanced disease. In addition, we will evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and activity of dose escalation of erlotinib in patients who do not develop a&#xD;
      rash. Clinical outcome will be correlated to EGFR status based on immunohistochemistry and&#xD;
      gene amplification status as well as Kras mutations from archival tumor tissue.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic carcinoma that&#xD;
             is locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20&#xD;
             mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Surgery: Previous surgery is permissible. Patients must be &gt; 4 weeks from any major&#xD;
        surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy: Patients may have received up to 1 prior line of gemcitabine based&#xD;
             systemic therapy (single agent or combination therapy) for locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic disease. Prior therapy with inhibitors of angiogenesis is permitted. All&#xD;
             toxicities must be resolved to &lt; Grade 1 (CTCAE v 3.0) and the last dose must have&#xD;
             been given at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may also have received prior 5 FU (+/- folinic acid) or gemcitabine given&#xD;
             concurrently with radiation as a &quot;radiation sensitizer&quot;. All toxicities must be&#xD;
             resolved and the last dose of chemotherapy must have been given at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation: Patients may have received prior radiation treatment for management of&#xD;
             local disease providing that disease progression has been documented (either locally&#xD;
             or systemically), all toxicities have resolved, and the last fraction of radiation&#xD;
             treatment was completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of erlotinib in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study&#xD;
             but will be eligible for future pediatric single-agent trials, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than or equal to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status &lt;2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes &gt;/= 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 UNL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT) &lt;/= 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  INR &lt;/= 1.5 unless on warfarin (see 3.1.9)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since CYP3A4 appears to be the major enzyme responsible for the human hepatic&#xD;
             metabolism of erlotinib in vitro, the concurrent use of inhibitors and inducers of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 are prohibited during the study treatment period. Concurrent use of CYP3A4&#xD;
             substrates are allowed, however, use caution and monitor the patient for potential&#xD;
             drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is a potential interaction between erlotinib and warfarin. Patients have&#xD;
             experienced elevated INRs and bleeding with this combination of drugs. Patients on&#xD;
             warfarin with PT INR &gt;1.5 are eligible provided that all of the following criteria are&#xD;
             met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is therapeutic on a stable dose of warfarin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The upper target for INR is no greater than 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk&#xD;
             of bleeding (e.g., CT evidence of tumor invading the duodenum or known varices).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of erlotinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents concurrently are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with inhibitors of the EGFR (eg. cetuximab, EMD 72000, panitumumab,&#xD;
             gefitinib, erlotinib) or multitargeted agents that inhibit EGFR (eg. ZD6474, AEE788).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with allergies to or a history of allergic reactions attributed to any other&#xD;
             compound of similar chemical or biologic composition to erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with greater than grade 1 diarrhea at baseline. Patients with pancreatic&#xD;
             cancer often have diarrhea due to pancreatic insufficiency, so a trial of pancreatic&#xD;
             enzymes may be warranted to reduce baseline diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PT INR &gt;1.5 unless the patient is on full-dose warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any condition that impairs their ability to swallow and retain pills&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because&#xD;
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because erlotinib has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             erlotinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with erlotinib. Appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
