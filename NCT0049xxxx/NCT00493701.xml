  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past 3 years we have identified a &quot;thrifty-phenotype&quot; characterized in lean men by an&#xD;
      inability to adapt rapidly to a high fat diet and associated with a low maximal VO2 and high&#xD;
      fasting insulin. We hypothesize that the individuals with the &quot;thrifty phenotype&quot; are at&#xD;
      higher risk for becoming obese, and that exercise may be effective in overcoming this&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several questions remain to be answered regarding the &quot;thrifty&quot; phenotype. First, given the&#xD;
      large interindividual differences, how can we identify those at the highest risk? What are&#xD;
      the distinguishing biochemical, endocrine and environmental characteristics of individuals&#xD;
      that store fat when exposed to high fat diets? This is important because if these individuals&#xD;
      can be easily identified, then dietary interventions can be targeted to this &quot;at-risk&quot;&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, what is different about the individual with the &quot;thrifty phenotype&quot;? Are there&#xD;
      cellular pathways that are dysregulated in the skeletal muscle of these individuals when&#xD;
      compared to controls? Is the defect intrinsic, i.e. a diminished ability to conserve glucose&#xD;
      and oxidize fat in skeletal muscle or alternately, is the phenotype due to environmental, and&#xD;
      dietary factors such as inactivity and energy excess?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, we have planned a three-year project that aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the biochemical, endocrine, anthropometric and environmental&#xD;
           characteristics of individuals with the &quot;thrifty&quot; phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the signaling pathways in skeletal muscle that are dysregulated in individuals&#xD;
           with the &quot;thrifty&quot; phenotype through mRNA expression profiling in skeletal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the role of environmental factors such as inactivity and caloric intake vs.&#xD;
           intrinsic (genetic) factors in the &quot;thrifty&quot; phenotype.&#xD;
