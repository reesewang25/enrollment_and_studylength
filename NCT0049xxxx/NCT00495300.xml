    <textblock>
      This protocol will collect blood samples and medical information from patients who have had a&#xD;
      bone marrow transplant using cells from an unrelated donor identified through the National&#xD;
      Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). The NMDP has two programs in which patients can participate: the&#xD;
      Research Database Program and the Research Sample Repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have received a bone marrow transplant at the NIH or other institution from an&#xD;
      unrelated donor affiliated with the NMDP may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the NMDP Research Database program will have medical information about their&#xD;
      disease and their transplant sent to the NMDP before and after the transplant and once a year&#xD;
      for the rest of their life. The information will be used to help determine how well&#xD;
      transplant recipients recover from their transplant, how recovery after a transplant can be&#xD;
      improved, how access to transplant for different groups of patients can be improved and how&#xD;
      well donors recover from collection procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the NMDP Research Sample Repository program will have a small blood sample&#xD;
      drawn from a vein in the arm just before they start taking medicines for the conditioning&#xD;
      regimen to prepare them for the transplant. The blood samples will be used to look at ways to&#xD;
      improve how patients are matched with their donors, to determine and evaluate the factors&#xD;
      that affect transplant outcome, and to help develop methods to improve tissue matching&#xD;
      between donors and recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has entered into a Transplant Center Participation&#xD;
      Agreement with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). This agreement allows any NIH&#xD;
      investigator with an NIH Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol to secure&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) or cord blood units from the NMDP/CIBMTR registry for the&#xD;
      purpose of transplanting patients who have no suitable matched related donors. As part of&#xD;
      this agreement, the NMDP/CIBMTR Research Program requires that blood samples as well as&#xD;
      baseline and outcome data (mainly demographic, quality of life, and clinical data) be&#xD;
      collected and maintained in accordance with the NMDP/CIBMTR IRB approved protocols. The goal&#xD;
      of the NMDP/CIBMTR Research Program is to improve the safety and effectiveness of unrelated&#xD;
      donor HSC transplantation for both the donors and recipients, and to have a comprehensive&#xD;
      source of data that can be used to study unrelated donor HSC transplantation. The NMDP/CIBMTR&#xD;
      is the sole custodian of the data in the Research Database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to incorporate all the NMDP/CIBMTR requirements for&#xD;
      securing data and blood samples on recipients whose transplant was facilitated by NMDP/CIBMTR&#xD;
      here at NIH as well as TED (Transplant Essential Data) level data submission for Allogeneic&#xD;
      recipient patients and their donors. This protocol will include patients at the NIH that have&#xD;
      enrolled in an NIH IRB approved protocol to receive related donor transplants as well as&#xD;
      matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSC transplants or cord blood transplants facilitated by the&#xD;
      NMDP/CIBMTR. It may also include patients that have undergone a MUD transplant at another&#xD;
      approved transplant center but need to receive additional blood products from the donor while&#xD;
      at NIH after completing a transplant center transfer. As of 03/02/2020, all newly enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will only have TED level data submission to NMDP.&#xD;
