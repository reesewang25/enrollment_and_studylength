    <textblock>
      IPT/SP was adopted in 2005 by The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Burkina Faso to replace&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis with CQ in pregnancy. The new strategy is being implemented but no delivery&#xD;
      approach was defined and presumably IPT/SP will only be delivered to pregnant women&#xD;
      presenting at ANC visits. It would be of extreme importance to ensure a better coverage and&#xD;
      higher compliance to make the new strategy effective. In order to obtain a more efficient&#xD;
      IPT/SP programme with a good level of compliance and coverage, several delivery approaches&#xD;
      beside ANC should be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study site will be in Pissy health district covering both peri-urban Ouagadougou city and&#xD;
      rural areas. Participants include pregnant women irrespective of gravidity residing in the&#xD;
      study area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective comparative study of 3 different approaches of delivering IPT/SP&#xD;
      in the catchment areas of rural health facilities. The approaches will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Passive health centre based delivery approach (PHC). IPT/SP will be delivered to&#xD;
           pregnant women presenting to the health centre for ANC visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Joint, with an advanced strategies delivery approach (JAS). In addition to passive&#xD;
           delivery at health centres, the pregnant women will be reached during preventive&#xD;
           activities the health staff carry out regularly in villages, such as immunization,&#xD;
           health promotion, and even ANC visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Community based distribution delivery approach (CBD). In addition to passive delivery at&#xD;
           health centres, the pregnant women will be reached by traditional birth attendants&#xD;
           (TBAs) or representatives of village women's associations (RWAs). Each approach will be&#xD;
           implemented in a zone constituted by the catchment area of a number of health centres to&#xD;
           achieve the required sample size. The zones will be randomly assigned to a delivery&#xD;
           approach. The main outcomes to be measured are: a) the coverage of IPT, b) compliance,&#xD;
           c) infection prevalence, d) Hb level, e) difficulties and constraints of each approach,&#xD;
           f) the acceptability to population and health staff and g) the performance of each&#xD;
           approach to deliver IPT /SP. to be able to identify a significant increase in coverage&#xD;
           of 10%, each group should be composed of n = 3841 pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross sectional surveys will be carried out at the beginning, during and at the end of the&#xD;
      study period. The study will be carried out over 24 months from June 2007.&#xD;

      Pregnant women are more susceptible to malaria than non-pregnant women, in particular during&#xD;
      the first pregnancies. Malaria infection in pregnant women may cause anaemia, illness and&#xD;
      abortion or stillbirth. It may also cause low birth weight through placental infection. In&#xD;
      Africa the burden of malaria in pregnancy is highest in remote rural areas. IPT with&#xD;
      sulphadoxine - pyrimethamine (SP) has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing&#xD;
      pregnancy related malaria (anaemia, clinical cases and placenta infection), and to be&#xD;
      beneficial to both babies and pregnant women, and increasing ANC attendance. In many Sub -&#xD;
      Saharan African countries, IPT / SP is being adopted to replace chloroquine (CQ) as&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis was shown to be no longer efficacious. IPT/SP was adopted in 2005 by The&#xD;
      Ministry of Health (MoH) of Burkina Faso to replace chemoprophylaxis with CQ. The new&#xD;
      strategy is being implemented but no delivery approach was defined and presumably IPT/SP will&#xD;
      only be delivered to pregnant women presenting at ANC visits. Although the expected&#xD;
      compliance should be better than for the previous CQ weekly regime, it would be of importance&#xD;
      to ensure a better coverage and higher compliance to make the new strategy effective.&#xD;
      Therefore, in order to obtain a more efficient IPT / SP programme with a good level of&#xD;
      compliance and coverage, several delivery approaches beside use of ANC alone will be&#xD;
      explored. It is hypothesized that the IPT strategy using SP will be as inefficient as&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis with CQ if an effective delivery approach is not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective: to assess different IPT/SP delivery approaches in rural Burkina Faso with&#xD;
      the aim of improving coverage and compliance among pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To implement three approaches of IPT/SP delivery to pregnant women based on health&#xD;
           centre distribution, and in addition community based distribution either by health&#xD;
           services or by community members;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effects of the approaches on compliance to and coverage of IPT / SP and&#xD;
           their feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material &amp; Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be implemented in Burkina Faso. Malaria is endemic with seasonal&#xD;
      transmission and is responsible for considerable ill health among pregnant women. The study&#xD;
      site will be situated in the rural area of the Pissy health district which covers both the&#xD;
      western peri-urban zone of Ouagadougou city and adjacent rural areas. There are a total of 25&#xD;
      health facilities in the district (both rural and urban) and a reference hospital at&#xD;
      Ouagadougou. In 2004 the population of the district was approx. 542000 inhabitants. The&#xD;
      estimated number of pregnancies was 27000. There is generally low attendance for antenatal&#xD;
      care (ANC) and 15% of babies are born with LBW. In a study carried out in the Boromo rural&#xD;
      district, only 51% of pregnant women had 2 ANC visits before delivery (Coulibaly, personal&#xD;
      communication). HIV infection prevalence was found around 4% for the whole country (MoH,&#xD;
      2005) and there is no indication that it is different for the Pissy district catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will include pregnant women irrespective of gravidity residing in the&#xD;
      study area and reachable by the approach that is applied in the zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective comparative study of 3 different approaches of delivering IPT / SP in the&#xD;
      catchment areas of rural health facilities. The approaches will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Passive health centre based delivery approach (PHC). IPT/SP will be delivered to all&#xD;
           pregnant women presenting to the health centre either for ANC visit or for care seeking&#xD;
           consultation. Drugs will be administered as a directly observed treatment (DOT). Some&#xD;
           collation may be given to women as some of them refuse to take drugs because they have&#xD;
           not eaten before. This approach, which is the most likely to be applied by the MOH, will&#xD;
           serve as the control one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Joint methods, with an advanced strategies delivery approach (JAS). In addition to&#xD;
           passive delivery at health centres, the pregnant women will be reached during preventive&#xD;
           activities the health staff carry out regularly in villages, such as immunization,&#xD;
           health promotion, and even ANC visits. The women will be asked to present to the health&#xD;
           staff for treatment and IPT/SP administered as DOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Community based distribution delivery approach (CBD). In addition to passive delivery at&#xD;
           health centres, the pregnant women will be reached by traditional birth attendants&#xD;
           (TBAs) or representatives of village women's associations (RWAs). The IPT/SP is then&#xD;
           delivered also as DOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two community - directed approaches will be further developed through workshops with&#xD;
      health staff, communities, and resource persons to adapt them to the local situation. Each&#xD;
      approach will be implemented in a zone constituted by the catchment area of a number of&#xD;
      health centres to cover the required sample size. The zones will be selected in order to&#xD;
      avoid contamination between them and randomly assigned to a delivery approach. The main&#xD;
      outcomes to be measured are: a) the coverage of IPT (proportion of pregnant women who are&#xD;
      administered the treatment), b) the compliance (number of administered doses per pregnant&#xD;
      woman), c) the infection prevalence, d) the Hb rate, e) the most relevant difficulties and&#xD;
      constraints to each approach, f) the acceptability to population and health staff and g) the&#xD;
      performance of each approach to deliver IPT /SP. The sample size is calculated to measure a&#xD;
      difference between groups of 10% in IPT administration coverage. Assuming we require 80%&#xD;
      power (zβ = 0.84) of detecting a significant difference (P&lt;0.05; zα/2 =1.96) if the&#xD;
      intervention increases coverage by 10%, each group should be composed of n = 3841 pregnant&#xD;
      women. Assuming a design effect of 1.5, n = 5762 women. The 3 geographical zones will be&#xD;
      defined to each cover 5800 expected pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross sectional surveys will be carried out at the beginning, during and at the end of the&#xD;
      study period. The first will aim to ensure the study zones are comparable regarding the&#xD;
      outcomes a) b) c) and d) and later on for comparison between zones. Furthermore, SP will be&#xD;
      measured in urine using dipsticks for compliance measurement. An anthropological component&#xD;
      will assess part of main outcomes e) and f) in health staff, communities, and pregnant women.&#xD;
      Questionnaires, focus group discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews (IDI) will be used for&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey data collection. Data about pregnancy and IPT will be recorded from&#xD;
      personal ANC book to be credible. The sample sizes will be calculated to be representative of&#xD;
      the populations of different villages and zones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on IPT / SP delivery will be also collected from records hold by health centre and TBAs&#xD;
      / RWAs to measure main outcome e). Specific records different from the health centre's own&#xD;
      records will be opened at each IPT/SP delivery site, including TBAs / RWAs, to register&#xD;
      information on treated pregnant women. The information will be personal data (name, age,&#xD;
      village, marital status, and profession), data on the current and previous pregnancies (rank&#xD;
      of pregnancy, children, ANC visits, drugs given) and medical history (previous adverse&#xD;
      reactions to drugs, fever, and malaria attacks), and the administered IPT/SP doses. As usual,&#xD;
      the IPT / SP treatment received will be recorded in the women's personal ANC book as proof&#xD;
      for further use, including the cross sectional surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be regularly entered with Epi Info software and analysed using Stata&#xD;
      version 9. Qualitative data will be processed and reports produced. Proportions will be&#xD;
      compared by ANOVA and means by student t test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training sessions will be organized for caregivers to harmonize IPT administration (as it is&#xD;
      not yet in practice in Burkina Faso) and study implementation in each study zone. The PI will&#xD;
      undertake monthly supervision in each zone. During the preparation phase, more information&#xD;
      will be gathered to better understand the health district and centres organization and&#xD;
      functioning system regarding ANC and malaria prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period The study will be carried out over 24 months from June 2007.&#xD;
