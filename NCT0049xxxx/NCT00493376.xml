    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine whether tirapazamine damages cervical tumour DNA immediately after its&#xD;
           administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the blood flow and oxygen level of cervical tumour before and after&#xD;
           treatment with tirapazamine&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced cervical cancer can have a poor clinical outcome with standard&#xD;
      cisplatin and pelvic radiation therapy. It is well established that pre-treatment tumor&#xD;
      hypoxia is a significant prognostic factor in tumors and may be one of the most important and&#xD;
      modifiable mechanisms of radiation resistance in this group of tumours. Significant levels of&#xD;
      hypoxia are not present in all locally advanced cervical tumors. Hence measurement of the&#xD;
      pretreatment tumour oxygenation status is imperative, and can be assessed using various&#xD;
      means. Immunohistochemical staining of various intrinsic hypoxia markers to include Ca9,&#xD;
      Glut1, HIF-1 alpha on the pre-treatment tumours can be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tirapazamine, a bio-reductively activated hypoxic cell selective anti-tumour agent, has been&#xD;
      found to act synergistically with cisplatinum, resulting in a significantly higher cell kill&#xD;
      than expected based on additive action. We proposed to measure the cell killing effect of&#xD;
      tirapazamine with the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comet assay: Tirapazamine causes DNA damage that can predict for cell killing by&#xD;
           measuring DNA damage in cells from tumor biopsies using the alkaline comet assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of phosphorylation of histone gamma H2AX: It has been explored as a measure&#xD;
           of radiosensitivity in response to clinically relevant doses of radiation. The histone&#xD;
           gamma H2AX phosphorylation can be used to detect tirapazamine induced DNA double-strand&#xD;
           breaks and collapsed replication forks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence that the drug delivery may be impaired and in fact the drug may not&#xD;
      actually be reaching all of the hypoxic tumour cells. A recent study has shown that, in an&#xD;
      experimental setting, tirapazamine causes a decrease in vascular perfusion which can be&#xD;
      measured with contrast enhanced MRI. We propose to assess if this mechanism is operative in&#xD;
      human tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies have demonstrated that tumour vascular can increase during the course of&#xD;
      radiation therapy, consistent with re-oxygenation and that this is suggestive of a better&#xD;
      outcome. Tumours that become less hypoxic during the course of therapy have an increased&#xD;
      likelihood of response to the given treatment. However, response to tirapazamine may be&#xD;
      reduced. In order to assess both the vascular change that may occur directly because of&#xD;
      tirapazamine infusion, as well as any increase in tumour vascularity and perhaps increase in&#xD;
      tumour oxygenation during the course of therapy, we plan to assess these tumours during the&#xD;
      course of therapy. Assessment of tumour perfusion and vessel permeability after 10 radiation&#xD;
      treatments (on day 12) of chemo-radiation therapy will be performed via T1 weighted dynamic&#xD;
      contrast enhanced MRI (DCMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tirapazamine (a hypoxic cell cytotoxin and radiosensitizer) will result in increased DNA&#xD;
           damage and a better clinical outcome if:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the pre-treatment tumor demonstrates significant hypoxia&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. tirapazamine treatment results in increased DNA damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. tirapazamine acts, in part, by changing vascular perfusion in the tumour and that these&#xD;
           changes can be measured with dynamic contrast enhanced MRI.&#xD;
