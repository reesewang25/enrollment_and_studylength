    <textblock>
      There is much evidence that a reduction in dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure in&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals, however few have looked at effect of 'no added salt diet' and&#xD;
      modest salt intake on total restriction of sodium intake with especial attention to very&#xD;
      exact surrogate of urinary sodium excretion. Our study demonstrates that a modest reduction&#xD;
      in salt intake from regular level of 10 - 12 g per day to the recommended level of 5 - 6 g&#xD;
      per day lowers blood pressure by 12.1/ 6.8 mmHg at day time and 11.1/5.9 mmhg at night&#xD;
      time.However only 35% of patients reach to the goal of sodium restriction of diet(below 100&#xD;
      meq/dl in 24 hours urine.It means even modest salt restriction can dramatically decrease&#xD;
      blood pressure with no added salt diet.&#xD;

      Abstract Incidence of Hypertension as a major cardiovascular treat is increasing. The best&#xD;
      known diet for hypertensives is 'no added salt diet'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we evaluated the effect of 'no added salt diet' on hypertensive population with&#xD;
      high dietary sodium intake by measuring 24 hour urinary sodium excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method &amp; results: In this single center randomized study 80 patients (60 cases and 20&#xD;
      controls) not on any drug therapy for hypertension with mild to moderate hypertension were&#xD;
      enrolled. 24 hour holter monitoring of BP and 24 hour urinary sodium excretion were measured&#xD;
      before and after 6 weeks of 'no added salt diet'. There is no statistically significant&#xD;
      difference between age , weight , sex , Hyperlipidemia , family history of hypertension ,&#xD;
      mean systolic &amp; diastolic BP at day and night and mean urinary sodium excretion in 24 hour&#xD;
      urine of case &amp;control groups .78% of all patients had moderate to high salt intake .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 week of 'no added salt diet' systolic &amp; diastolic BP significantly decreased at day&#xD;
      (mean decrease: 12.1 /6.8 mmhg) and night (mean decrease: 11.1/5.9 mmhg ) which is&#xD;
      statistically significant between case &amp; control groups (P 0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary sodium excretion of 24 hour urine decreased 37.1meq/d Â± 39,67mg/dl which is&#xD;
      statistically significant in case &amp; control groups (p: 0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only 36% of patients after no added salt diet reach to pretreatment goal of 24 hour urinary&#xD;
      sodium excretion of below 100meq/dl (P:0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: despite modest effect on dietary sodium restriction, no added salt diet&#xD;
      significantly decreases systolic &amp; diastolic BP and should be advised to every hypertensive&#xD;
      patients. Trial registration research deputy-smums84-2384 Key words: blood pressure, No added&#xD;
