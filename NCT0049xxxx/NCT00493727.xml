  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at the effect of 30 days of treatment of 15 diabetics with proteinuria&#xD;
      with N-acetylcysteine ( Mucomyst ) at a dose of 1 gm twice a day by mouth. The primary&#xD;
      outcome that will be measured is change in the oxidant stress as measurable by changes in the&#xD;
      serum level of isoprostane, Glutathione peroxidase, aconitase and Total oxidant stress.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes measured will be changes in proteinuria and kidney function as measured by&#xD;
      spot urine pr/cr and estimated GFR by MDRD formula.&#xD;

      Mucomyst (Acetylcysteine) for amelioration of diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with Mucomyst over several months will reduce the oxidant stress and thereby reduce&#xD;
      the proteinuria and the progression of renal failure in patients with diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucomyst or Acetylcysteine has now been found to be beneficial in ameliorating radio-contrast&#xD;
      induced acute renal failure in several different studies (ref 1) The beneficial effects of&#xD;
      Mucomyst is most likely due to its antioxidative properties. Oxidative stress plays a major&#xD;
      role in diabetic complication especially in diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent in vitro study Acetylcysteine ameliorated the deleterious effects of albumin on&#xD;
      cultured renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Murine proximal tubular cells were treated&#xD;
      with albumin (30 mg/ml medium) for various lengths of time. The results showed that albumin&#xD;
      could activate Stat1 and Stat5 within 15 min in proximal tubular cells. The activation of&#xD;
      STATs was mediated mostly by Jak2 and required no protein synthesis. In addition, activation&#xD;
      of Stat1 occurred even after neutralization of IFN- . The activation of STATs was inhibited&#xD;
      by N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a precursor of glutathione and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#xD;
      scavenger, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed upregulation of&#xD;
      intracellular ROS after albumin overloading, suggesting that albumin per se could generate&#xD;
      ROS in proximal tubular cells. The activation of STATs occurred by way of the ROS generating&#xD;
      system, and especially through the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase system. Reduced activities of&#xD;
      glutathione peroxidase and catalase could also be responsible for the accumulation of&#xD;
      intracellular ROS. Hence, not only the ROS generating system, but also the ROS scavenging&#xD;
      system may contribute to the induction of ROS by albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine also may attenuate the course of hepatorenal syndrome, a renal&#xD;
      vasoconstrictive response of indeterminate nature that develops during advanced liver&#xD;
      failure. This effect, shown in experimental settings [9] and in a preliminary clinical report&#xD;
      [10], could imply a better preservation of liver function. However, direct renal protective&#xD;
      mechanisms may play a role also, considering the ubiquitous distribution of acylases that&#xD;
      catalyze the deacetylation of NAC [11]. Indeed, recent studies suggest that NAC may increase&#xD;
      intracellular glutathione and ameliorate renal ischemia-reflow injury [12-14], inferior vena&#xD;
      cava-occlusion [15] or kidney damage from cis-platinum [16], cyclosporine [17], and other&#xD;
      nephrotoxic insults [18, 19]. NAC has been reported recently to prevent radiocontrast&#xD;
      nephropathy in high-risk patients [20]. These studies, conducted in a clinical trial without&#xD;
      preliminary experiments in animals, underscore the safety of oral NAC administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above, the mechanism of NAC-related organ protection is primarily attributed to&#xD;
      scavenging oxygen free radicals, either directly, or through increasing intracellular&#xD;
      glutathione concentration [3, 4]. Indeed, decreased malonaldehyde production indicates an&#xD;
      attenuation of membrane damage from oxygen-free radicals [3], but other protective mechanisms&#xD;
      may play a role as well [21]. Improved local microcirculation may be a major potential&#xD;
      NAC-related organ-protective mechanism. NAC was reported to augment papillary flow [22] and&#xD;
      was found to improve renal vasodilation in response to acetylcholine [15]. Thus, perhaps some&#xD;
      of the protective effects of NAC can be attributed to improved glomerular hemodynamics or to&#xD;
      the prevention of hypoxic tubular damage via restoration of altered renal microcirculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAC ameliorates renal vasoconstriction, an effect that seems to be mediated by mechanisms&#xD;
      other than prostaglandins and nitric oxide&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAC had been safely used in a large group of ESRD patients for over one year ( 600 mg bid by&#xD;
      mouth ) in a prospective randomized trial . The group treated with NAC had reduction in&#xD;
      composite cardiovascular endpoints ( 18% vs 47%) ( Ref: Circulation2003,107: 992 . Tepel et&#xD;
      al )&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly in a RCt of Alzheimer patients NAC treatment for 6 months showed benefit in&#xD;
      cognitive tasks in the treatment group. ( Ref: Neurology2001, 23: 57: Adair et al )&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous injection of NAC prior to dialysis increased the dialysis clearance of&#xD;
      homocysteine and improved endothelial function in a group of ESRD patient ( Ref: Circulation&#xD;
      2003, 109: 369; Scholze et al )&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAC treatment was also found to have potentiating effect of the antihypertensive effects of&#xD;
      ACE inhibitors in hypertensive patients ( Blood pressure 2002, 11:235; Barrios et al )&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another RCT in an aging population, chronic treatment with NAC was seen to cause&#xD;
      significant decrease in plasma TNF-alpha and improved the muscle strength. ( Ref: J Mol MED&#xD;
      2003; 81: 118; Hauer et al.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with diabetes and proteinuria at any level will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Patients who are on dialysis and who have known allergy to Mucomyst will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will get Mucomyst 1000 mg by mouth twice a day for 30 days. Urine and serum will be&#xD;
      collected at the beginning, , at 15 and 30 days after starting Mucomyst and 30 days after&#xD;
      stopping Mucomyst. Portions of the blood and urine will be frozen and mailed to a special lab&#xD;
      to measure the chemicals that determine the level of oxidative stress. The particular&#xD;
      chemicals that will be tested for are isoprostane in urine and isoprostane, aconitase,&#xD;
      glutathione peroxidase and total serum antioxidant stress in the blood. The special tests&#xD;
      will be done by Dr. Valyathan's lab . Locally we will test blood and urine for proteinuria&#xD;
      and kidney Fx.&#xD;

      Collection of blood for different measures of oxidant stress: serum will be frozen to be sent&#xD;
      to Dr. Vallyathan's lab later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for renal function test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spot urine protein/cr (quantitative proteinuria) and also for measuring isoprostane&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the reduction in the measured oxidant stress markers in the serum&#xD;
      such as isoprostane, glutathione peroxidase, aconitase, and total oxidant stress. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome will be reduction in proteinuria and the change in kidney function during treatment&#xD;
      with Mucomyst.&#xD;
