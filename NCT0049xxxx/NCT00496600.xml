    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded, dose escalation study of patupilone in combination with RAD001 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced cancer to find the maximum tolerated dose of each drug. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to see what doses of RAD001 and patupilone are safe to use when the two drugs&#xD;
      are used at the same time. Other goals in this study are to learn about the effect of RAD 001&#xD;
      and patupilone on tumor growth; to find out what amount of RAD001 is present in the blood&#xD;
      when it is combined with patupilone; to learn about proteins in the blood that may predict or&#xD;
      show an effect of RAD001 or patupilone and to learn if any changes are seen in the tumor with&#xD;
      the type of test called a PET scan.Subjects will be assigned to a dosing group. The dose of&#xD;
      patupilone and RAD001 a subject gets depends on when they enter onto this study. The initial&#xD;
      subjects in the study will take the lowest doses of RAD001 and patupilone. At least 3&#xD;
      subjects will be treated in each dosing group starting with the smallest dose. If there are&#xD;
      few or easy to handle side effects, the next group of at least 3 people to enter in the study&#xD;
      will get the next higher dose. This continues until the highest dose of the study drug is&#xD;
      found that does not cause serious or hard to treat side effects. Both the subjects and the&#xD;
      study doctor will know which dose is assigned. In this study, RAD001 will be given as tablets&#xD;
      to take with water. RAD001 will be taken for either 7, 14, or 21 days of each 21 day cycle&#xD;
      depending on which dosing group is assigned. If taking RAD 001 and patupilone on the same&#xD;
      day, then RAD 001 will be taken with water however prior to receiving patupilone.Patupilone&#xD;
      will be given by an intravenous injection (through a vein) for 20 minutes on Days 1 or day 6&#xD;
      of the 21-day cycle. The patupilone dose will be based on height and weight. Blood tests&#xD;
      (approximately 1-3 teaspoons) will be done every week. Every six weeks a CT scan or MRI will&#xD;
      be done to assess the tumor size. Subjects will continue to receive RAD001 and patupilone as&#xD;
      long as the tumor is stable or shrinking, and not having too many side effects from&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint To identify the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of the combination of&#xD;
      patupilone and RAD001&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints To assess the toxicity of patupilone and RAD001 To determine if&#xD;
      concentrations of RAD001 are elevated in the presence of patupilone To evaluate tumor&#xD;
      response using standard imaging modalities (CT scan, x-ray, bone scan) To develop&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic markers that may predict or indicate response to mTOR inhibition or&#xD;
      patupilone treatment.&#xD;

    <description>RAD001 will be taken orally starting at a dose of 30 mg every week for the first cohort of patients, one hour prior to administration of patupilone. Patupilone will then be administered as an infusion, starting at 5 mg/m2 for the first cohort of patients. The dosage and scheduling of RAD001 and patupilone during each 21-day cycle will vary according to cohort assignment</description>
