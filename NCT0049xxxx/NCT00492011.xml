  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to determine the degree to which ramelteon, once daily (QD), can&#xD;
      reduce the insomnia symptoms associated with rapid, eastward travel across 5 time zones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circadian dysrhythmia, or jet lag, is defined as multiple biologic and psychologic stresses&#xD;
      created by rapid travel across multiple time zones. As more people are transported by jet&#xD;
      aircraft, the issue of jet lag becomes more important. What was an inconvenience during&#xD;
      travel for leisure is now a physiologic consequence for the travelers and crew.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jet lag is composed of a variety of unpleasant symptoms that vary with the number of time&#xD;
      zones crossed, the individual, and even the direction flown (east versus west). The most&#xD;
      typical symptoms include daytime sleepiness, fatigue, impaired alertness, and trouble&#xD;
      initiating and maintaining sleep. Other symptoms of circadian dysrhythmia are insomnia,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complaints, apathy, weakness, irritability, malaise, and loss of appetite.&#xD;
      Travel across time zones also has been associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, depression, and&#xD;
      impaired cognitive performance in individuals at risk. Decreased sport performance has been&#xD;
      noted in several studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to environmental and social cues, physical factors, such as age, hydration&#xD;
      status, and illness, could adversely affect the ability to entrain (adjust) quickly. The&#xD;
      stressors of flight, noise, vibration, decreased humidity, barometric pressure changes, and&#xD;
      decreased partial pressure of oxygen all contribute to crew and travelers health at the&#xD;
      destination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being out of synchronicity with the environment causes jet lag symptoms. Travel through time&#xD;
      zones places the body in a situation when it must sleep when not tired and awaken when the&#xD;
      internal cues are initiating sleep. The brain's internal clock is the suprachiasmatic nucleus&#xD;
      within the hypothalamus the body is in a constant state of circadian adjustment to remain&#xD;
      entrained to a given time zone. In addition to the subjective feeling of well being are&#xD;
      measurable changes associated with daily patterns. For example, core body temperature changes&#xD;
      throughout the day and decreases before falling asleep. Melatonin levels increase in the&#xD;
      evening and night and recede during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor 1 and melatonin receptor 2 agonist currently marketed in&#xD;
      the US for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep onset. Study&#xD;
      participation is anticipated to be about 2 weeks.&#xD;
