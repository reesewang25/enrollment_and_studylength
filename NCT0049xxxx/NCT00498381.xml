      Aim of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the level of IL-6 mRNA expression in peripheral blood monocytes between&#xD;
           normal subjects and patients with OSAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the activation of NF-B in peripheral blood monocytes between control&#xD;
           subjects and patients with OSAS; Check the correlation between level of L-6 mRNA&#xD;
           expression and activation of NF-kB&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the effect of CPAP on the activation of NF-kB and IL-6 in peripheral blood&#xD;
           monocytes in patients with moderate -severe OSAS&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has emerged in recent years as an important risk&#xD;
      factor for cardiovascular morbidity. The mechanisms responsible for developments of&#xD;
      cardiovascular sequelae in patients with OSA include hypoxia, hypercapnia, exaggerated&#xD;
      negative intrathoracic pressure and bursts of sympathetic activity provoking surges in blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate. Meanwhile, increase of inflammatory mediators, which included&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP), oxidative stress, adhesion molecules, vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) -1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and&#xD;
      tumor necrotic factor- (TNF-)), also involve in the development of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      in patients with OSAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our preliminary study, serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were higher in patients with&#xD;
      OSAS than control subjects and levels of both IL-6 and CRP were highly correlated with the&#xD;
      lowest pulse oxygen saturation. Hypoxia triggered the production of IL-6 through the&#xD;
      induction of NFB, which was demonstrated in ischemic heart disease and pancreatitis.&#xD;
      However, this mechanism has not been prooved in OSAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we conduct this study to prove our hypothesis (1) The mRNA expression of IL-6 in&#xD;
      peripheral blood monocytes was significantly higher in patients with OSAS than control&#xD;
      subjects (2) The activation of NF-k B in peripheral blood monocytes was more significant in&#xD;
      patients with OSAS than control subjects, and the level of NF- kB activation is associated&#xD;
      with the level of IL-6 mRNA expression (3) CPAP therapy could lower both the activation of&#xD;
      NF-kB and IL-6 mRNA expression in patients with moderate-severe OSAS.&#xD;
