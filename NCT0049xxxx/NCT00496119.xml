    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if proton beam therapy, with or without&#xD;
      photon beam radiation therapy, is effective in the treatment of skull base chordoma. The&#xD;
      safety of this treatment will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proton therapy is a kind of external beam radiation therapy where protons are directed to a&#xD;
      tumor site. Researchers are trying to determine what level of proton therapy gives the most&#xD;
      benefit without causing toxic side effects. Researchers will also be testing the treatment's&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor feels it is necessary, the proton beam therapy may be combined with standard&#xD;
      photon therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will receive proton beam therapy at The&#xD;
      University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), and possibly photon beam, no&#xD;
      sooner than 2 weeks after the last surgery to remove the tumor. You will receive proton beam&#xD;
      therapy once a day for about 35 treatments (7 weeks). Treatment will be given for 5 days in a&#xD;
      row each week (except for Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) at the MDACC Proton Center in&#xD;
      Houston. The whole process should take up to 1 hour each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The proton beam machine used to deliver treatment is&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for patient use. The doses being studied are experimental. About 15&#xD;
      participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MDACC.&#xD;

MRI (or CT in case MRI is contraindicated) of the skull base used to document the status of disease in the following categories: 1) stable disease, 2) progressive disease, 3) partial response/complete response. A post-operative MRI (or CT) obtained within 90 days of study registration serves as baseline with annual follow up till disease progression or death for any reason.</description>
