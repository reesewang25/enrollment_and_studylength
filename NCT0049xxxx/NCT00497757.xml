  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to establish chimerism and avoid graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      in patients who need a heart transplant.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the present time, heart transplant recipients must take anti-rejection medication to&#xD;
      prevent rejection of the donated heart. Even with this medication, chronic rejection is the&#xD;
      most common cause of late graft loss. The anti-rejection agents themselves are significantly&#xD;
      toxic, with side effects including kidney damage, infection and an increased incidence of&#xD;
      cancer. The goal of this study is to allow the patient to develop &quot;tolerance&quot; to the&#xD;
      transplanted heart while maintaining a competent immune system. Tolerance enables the&#xD;
      transplant recipient's body to recognize the transplanted organ as self rather than foreign&#xD;
      tissue. The recipient will not try to reject the donor heart and the need for anti-rejection&#xD;
      medication could be dramatically decreased or eliminated entirely. To accomplish this,&#xD;
      patients in this study will receive specially treated bone marrow taken from their heart&#xD;
      donor. Bone marrow transplant has been shown in animal studies and in humans to induce&#xD;
      tolerance following organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two factors limit the application of donor marrow transplant to induce tolerance: 1)&#xD;
      preparing the patient for transplant (conditioning); and 2) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
      Traditional conditioning destroys the recipient's immune system and requires that the marrow&#xD;
      transplant be successful because the patient is unable to fight off infection if the donor&#xD;
      cells do not survive. GVHD occurs when donor immune cells recognize the recipient's cells as&#xD;
      foreign tissue and attack them. Severe GVHD can result in death. This study utilizes a new&#xD;
      approach to conditioning which leaves the patient's immune system intact. The transplant&#xD;
      product is depleted of GVHD-producing cells but retains tolerance-promoting facilitating&#xD;
      cells, which are intended to ensure the donor and recipient cells coexists peacefully, a&#xD;
      state called mixed chimerism. The toxicity of conditioning and transplantation is&#xD;
      significantly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will determine the appropriate cell dose to safely establish mixed&#xD;
      chimerism following partial conditioning in heart transplant recipients. The study takes a&#xD;
      gradual approach to increasing the cell dose to achieve mixed chimerism. We believe this&#xD;
      study will provide a breakthrough in the approach to heart transplantation. Our goal is to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential of safely establishing mixed chimerism to induce tolerance following&#xD;
      heart transplant and reduce or eliminate the need for anti-rejection therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be between the ages of 18 and 70 years and meet the institution's&#xD;
             criteria for cardiac transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have acceptable negative results for infectious disease markers done&#xD;
             within two weeks of the bone marrow infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is receiving a first cardiac transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving a multi-organ transplant (i.e., heart/kidney) may be included at&#xD;
             the discretion of the PI and investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: These multi-organ subjects will have identical criteria with the exception of&#xD;
        adequate function of the affected organ to be transplanted (i.e., kidney). They are&#xD;
        included in the total of thirty subjects to be transplanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's panel reactive antibody (PRA) is &lt;40. If the patient is plasmapheresed prior&#xD;
             to the heart transplant, then the pre-transplant PRA will not be a consideration for&#xD;
             inclusion/exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have a negative crossmatch with the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine&#xD;
             test within 48 hours) before TBI and agree to use reliable contraception for one year&#xD;
             following transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically active bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation therapy at a dose that would preclude TBI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unable to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the procedures associated with the study (i.e., delivering TBI) would significantly&#xD;
             extend the cold ischemia time of the heart, the protocol will be abandoned and the&#xD;
             patient will receive a conventional heart transplant.&#xD;
