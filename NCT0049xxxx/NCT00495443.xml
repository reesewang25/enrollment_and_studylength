      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new laser system provides better safety&#xD;
      and efficacy than existing lasers in popular cosmetic procedures such as hair removal,&#xD;
      treatment of cosmetically disturbing vascular lesions and rhytides.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cosmetic lasers are a well-established, popular modality for removal of unwanted hair,&#xD;
      treatment of all types of vascular lesions, including hemangiomas, port wine stains, and a&#xD;
      variety of telangiectases as well as facial rhytides reduction. The existing lasers are based&#xD;
      on a wavelength that is specifically absorbed by the chromophore found in the target such as&#xD;
      hair follicle, where the energy is converted to heat resulting in a thermal injury. However,&#xD;
      the lasers for cosmetic treatments are not without limitations. A laser based long-term hair&#xD;
      removal treatment is based on thermal destruction of the hair shaft and follicle using&#xD;
      wavelengths that are specifically absorbed by the pigment melanin found in the hair follicle.&#xD;
      The heating of hair follicle is done through heat dissipation from the hair shaft. One of the&#xD;
      significant limitations of this approach is the fact that the epidermis through which the&#xD;
      light energy must penetrate is rich in melanin and therefore absorbs a major portion of the&#xD;
      energy, resulting in inadequate heating of the hair follicles. Similar problem exists when&#xD;
      targeting other chromophores such as hemoglobin or water. The purpose of the study is an&#xD;
      evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new laser based device.&#xD;
