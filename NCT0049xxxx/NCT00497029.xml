  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of a risk-based dental caries&#xD;
      prevention program conducted by dental personnel at an urban pediatric primary care clinic&#xD;
      serving largely low-income residents of Baltimore, Maryland, and to appraise this program as&#xD;
      a model for similar urban pediatric settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A demonstration caries prevention trial lasting 26 months was conducted with a total of 219&#xD;
      children aged 6 to 27 months of age. The &quot;prevention&quot; group consisting of children 6-15&#xD;
      months of age at their initial visit were compared at the end of the trial with a&#xD;
      &quot;comparison&quot; group at their initial visit. The comparison group was 12 months older than the&#xD;
      enrollment age of the prevention group (18-27 months) and had not received previous routine&#xD;
      professional dental care. Interventions were dental examination and periodic recalls,&#xD;
      caries-risk assessments, monitoring of oral mutans streptococci (MS) levels, application of&#xD;
      5.0% sodium fluoride varnish to teeth, dental health counseling to care-givers, referral for&#xD;
      dental treatment if indicated and periodic recalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures were: 1) number of decayed, missing, filled primary tooth surfaces, 2)&#xD;
      number of pre-carious lesions, 3) counts of oral MS and 3) care-giver responses to a&#xD;
      questionnaire about the child's diet and home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention group children at the last recall experienced fewer mean carious dental surfaces&#xD;
      (0.1 vs. 1.29, p&lt;0.014) and over 8-fold less MS (p&lt;0.013) than comparison group subjects at&#xD;
      the initial visit. The number of precarious lesions, however, were not significantly&#xD;
      different. In the absence of carious or precarious lesions, oral levels of MS was a reliable&#xD;
      indicator of caries risk status, particularly for low risk subjects (sensitivity, 0.64;&#xD;
      specificity, 0.98). Caregiver reports of dietary practices and presence or absence of visible&#xD;
      dental plaque also served as caries-risk determinants.&#xD;
