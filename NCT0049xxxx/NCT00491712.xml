    <textblock>
      The management of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a challenge for the ophthalmologist and&#xD;
      surgery is frequently needed to control IOP. The success rates of a drainage device is&#xD;
      usually lower in NVG than in other forms of glaucoma. Triamcinolone intra-vitreous injections&#xD;
      acetate has been used to treat macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy and central&#xD;
      retinal vein occlusion and also to control inflammation in ophthalmologic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we will compare the outcome and complications of Silicone Ahmed Valve in&#xD;
      GNV eyes with and without intra-vitreous triamcinolone injection.&#xD;

      The management of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a challenge for the ophthalmologist and&#xD;
      surgery is frequently needed to control intraocular pressure (IOP). The success rates of a&#xD;
      drainage device is usually lower in NVG than in other forms of glaucoma. Triamcinolone&#xD;
      intra-vitreous injections acetate has been used to treat macular edema secondary to diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion and also to control inflammation in&#xD;
      ophthalmologic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we will compare the outcome and complications of Silicone Ahmed Valve in&#xD;
      GNV eyes with and without intra-vitreous triamcinolone injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      49 Patients with clinically uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma were selected from the glaucoma&#xD;
      sector of Federal university of Sao Paulo. After retinal panfotocoagulation (RPF), patients&#xD;
      who still are uncontrolled are enrolled to the study. Patients were randomized to one of two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Silicone Ahmed Implant&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Silicone Ahmed Implant with intra-vitreous Triamcinolone injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NVG and uncontrolled IOP despite the use of maximum tolerated glaucoma&#xD;
      medication Patients over 18 years old. Patients who can understand and sign the inform&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Sclerites Uveitic NVG Previous psiquiatric condition Patients who can understand and&#xD;
      sign the inform consent form Visual acuity worse than hand motion Previous retina surgery&#xD;
      with buckle implant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery description A fornix-based conjunctival flap was created between two adjacent recti&#xD;
      muscles. Before placement of the tube implant body to the sclera, tube was irrigated with&#xD;
      saline solution to open the valve mechanism. The implant's polypropylene body was sutured to&#xD;
      sclera with 6.0 silk suture. The tube then trimmed and the anterior chamber was entered from&#xD;
      1mm posterior to corneoscleral limbus with 23-gauge needle. A human donor scleral flap was&#xD;
      placed over the tube and sutured to the sclera with 10.0 nylon suture. The conjunctiva was&#xD;
      sutured to the limbus. In the triamcinolone group, a intra-vitreous injection of 0,1mL&#xD;
      triamcinolone acetate (40mg/ml) was performed with a 30-gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up after surgery was in the 1st, 4th, 7th, 15th, 30th days and after that monthly or&#xD;
      whenever needed for clinical reasons.&#xD;
