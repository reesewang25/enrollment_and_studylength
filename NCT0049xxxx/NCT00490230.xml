      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess whether CL (caused by Leishmaniasis major) lesions treated with WR279396 improved the&#xD;
      cosmetic outcome compared with no treatment (natural healing)&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the cosmetic outcome of CL lesions treated with &quot;vehicle&quot; compared with no&#xD;
           treatment (natural healing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the cosmetic outcome of CL lesions treated with &quot;vehicle&quot; compared with&#xD;
           WR279396&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine whether CL lesions treated with vehicle improves the cosmetic outcome&#xD;
                (compared with natural healing)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine whether CL lesions treated with vehicle alone provides a cosmetic&#xD;
                outcome similar to WR279396&#xD;

    <description>The primary cosmetic outcome measure is the Clinical Scar Rating, based on a modified Vancouver Scar Score (mVSS). The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of persons judged to have either a &quot;superior (no scar)&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot; rating (see below).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Included are volunteers who participated in WRAIR 813 (HSRRB Log # 9768.1) and those&#xD;
             who participated in another CL study in/around the WRAIR 813 study site who had been&#xD;
             assigned to a &quot;no-treatment&quot; (natural healing) arm. All volunteers will have had&#xD;
             documented CL in the past that were treated with WR279396, vehicle, or no treatment&#xD;
             (natural history), have signed informed consent, and are willing to comply with study&#xD;
             assessments; age range: 5 to 75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For study subjects who were enrolled in WRAIR 813 in 2004 (WR279396 or vehicle&#xD;
             treated):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject or guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Willing to meet the requirements of the single clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior data in the clinical site data base documenting a diagnosis of CL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Each lesion for inclusion in this study conforms to WRAIR 813: ³ 1 cm in diameter&#xD;
                  and was primarily ulcerative (i.e., not verrucous or nodular)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The index lesion and others to be scored were proven parasitologically by Giemsa&#xD;
                  slide smear&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CL scars documented to be &gt; 360 days old (clock starts at time of diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No treatment of the lesions other than that received in the previous protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study subjects from the earlier studies to serve as &quot;no treatment&quot; controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject or guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Willing to meet the requirements of the single clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Prior data in the clinical site data base documenting a diagnosis of CL, and that&#xD;
                  the volunteer was assigned to the &quot;no treatment&quot; group&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Each lesion for inclusion in this study will conform to WRAIR 813: at the time of&#xD;
                  diagnosis, ≥1 cm in diameter and described as primarily ulcerative (i.e., not&#xD;
                  verrucous or nodular)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 1 lesion that was proven parasitologically by Giemsa slide smear for&#xD;
                  inclusion in the earlier study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CL scars documented to be &gt; 360 days old (clock starts at time of diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Never received any treatment of the lesions (natural healing) or applied any&#xD;
                  medication, such as herbal medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lesions present on the trunk or extremities, to match the WRAIR 813 study&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential volunteers without a prior documented diagnosis of CL&#xD;
