  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will address the key question of developing shared understanding and negotiating&#xD;
      mutually acceptable outcomes between people with asthma and healthcare professionals by&#xD;
      applying theoretical knowledge of self regulation and communication skills learning and&#xD;
      practice to asthma consultations. This study will facilitate integration of best practice&#xD;
      into normal care using the BTS/SIGN asthma guidelines as the basis for structured care. This&#xD;
      intervention has been show to be effective in the US. We aim to show that it can be effective&#xD;
      in the UK setting in a cluster randomised control trial. We aim to modify and evaluate the&#xD;
      intervention in such a way that it can be easily offered across UK primary care settings,&#xD;
      with the possibility of significant benefits for patients. The intervention is based on the&#xD;
      principle of empowering patients to manage their condition themselves, is consistent with the&#xD;
      aims of Asthma UK, and, for this reason, we believe that Asthma UK may wish to be associated&#xD;
      with this project.&#xD;

      This study involves training GPs and nurses to recognize that patients differ in terms of&#xD;
      asthma characteristics, such as symptoms and triggers, as well as personal attributes and&#xD;
      lifestyles. The programme teaches professionals to work with patients to improve their asthma&#xD;
      management; this involves helping people with asthma to observe themselves and their own&#xD;
      actions, and learn from these, to support self-help behaviours, integrating these into their&#xD;
      daily routines. The programme emphasizes good communication skills and working in partnership&#xD;
      with patients, as well as up-dating doctors and nurses in current best practice for treating&#xD;
      asthma. It is based on a programme successfully developed with American office based&#xD;
      paediatricians, which resulted in greater parent satisfaction with asthma visits to doctors,&#xD;
      and better asthma symptom control for patients. We wish to modify this American programme to&#xD;
      make it more suitable for UK doctors, nurses and patients. We have also included a component&#xD;
      into the programme to identify what exactly is effective in terms of how it impacts on&#xD;
      clinician attitudes, beliefs and behaviour before delivering it more widely. The success of&#xD;
      the project is evaluated not only by testing whether it improves the medical care and medical&#xD;
      outcomes of patients of the health professionals taking part, but also by measuring whether&#xD;
      patients are more satisfied with their consultations for asthma if their doctor or nurse has&#xD;
      taken part in the programme. UK (http://www.sign.ac.uk/) evidence-based guidelines recommend&#xD;
      helping those with asthma to control their symptoms and improve their quality of life through&#xD;
      provision of education and individualised, written action plans. Our aim is to carry out a&#xD;
      prospective, cluster randomised trial in general practices in Aberdeen and Glasgow, Scotland,&#xD;
      to assess the impact of an educational intervention targeted at training practice nurses and&#xD;
      general practitioners (GPs) in patient-centred asthma care; specifically in how to help&#xD;
      patients develop asthma self regulation skills. The intervention is modified from a programme&#xD;
      successfully implemented with American office based paediatricians, found to be effective in&#xD;
      an US paediatric asthma population in terms of clinical outcomes and parent satisfaction (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients seen by doctors and nurses in primary care who have been&#xD;
      trained in developing patient self regulation skills will have better asthma-related quality&#xD;
      of life, control and clinical outcomes, and be more satisfied with the clinical consultation,&#xD;
      than a control group of patients attending doctors and nurses who have not received training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One nominated GP and one nominated practice nurse from eight intervention practices will&#xD;
      receive training modified from the Clark-Evans programme of asthma training. GPs and practice&#xD;
      nurses nominated by eight control practices will deliver care as usual during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be targeted for recruitment when they present with symptoms or signs relating&#xD;
      to poorly controlled asthma to the nominated GPs or Practice nurses. Questionnaire data will&#xD;
      be collected from a baseline cohort, until 20 datasets per practice (16) have accrued (320 in&#xD;
      total). Questionnaire data will then be collected from 20 patients per practice presenting in&#xD;
      the same circumstances to the nominated GPs and Practice nurses in the intervention practices&#xD;
      (160 in total). Questionnaire data will also be collected from 20 patients per practice&#xD;
      presenting in the same circumstances to the nominated GPs and Practice nurses in the control&#xD;
      practices, who will deliver care as usual (160 in total). The post training cohorts (control&#xD;
      and intervention) will have follow up questionnaires at 3 and 12 months after the index&#xD;
      consultation. Routinely available data will be collected for all patients with evidence of&#xD;
      poorly controlled asthma before and after training. A total of 320 patients (160 to each arm)&#xD;
      from a total of 16 practices (ie. 20 patients per practice) will ensure 90% power in the&#xD;
      baseline and post-intervention cohorts at the 5% significance level (randomisation is by&#xD;
      practice so this sample size calculation was inflated to correct for the intracluster&#xD;
      correlation coefficient (ICC)) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures will be the Mini AQLQ (2) and the Medical Interview Satisfaction&#xD;
      Scale (MISS-21) (3). Secondary measures will be: Patients' Perception of their Involvement&#xD;
      Questionnaire (4), the Asthma Control Questionnaire, (ACQ) (5). A theory of planned behaviour&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to examine how specific components of the training package&#xD;
      influenced GP and practice nurse attitudes, behavioural intentions and self-efficacy. This&#xD;
      will identify how and why the training worked, and inform further modifications of the&#xD;
      programme to aid generalizability across UK settings.&#xD;
