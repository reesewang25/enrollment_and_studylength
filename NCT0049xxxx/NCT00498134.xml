  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the World. In China, gastric&#xD;
      cancer exceeds all other cancer mortality except lung cancer. Helicobacter pylori infection&#xD;
      is an important cause of gastric cancer. We have previously started a randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial in Changle in 1994 to address the issue of whether&#xD;
      eradication of H. pylori alone is able to prevent or reduce the risk of gastric cancer. The&#xD;
      project involved 1600 subjects and is still ongoing. On the other hand, our laboratory&#xD;
      research indicated that an abnormally high expression of an enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 was found&#xD;
      in gastric cancer and inhibition of this enzyme by a new drug (specific cyclooxygenase-2&#xD;
      inhibitor) could kill the cancer cells. The same drug is approved now for use in treatment of&#xD;
      hereditary colon cancer syndrome (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, FAP), in the same rationale&#xD;
      of tumour suppressive property of this drug. We are now initiating a second chemoprevention&#xD;
      study to assess the addition of this specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor together with&#xD;
      eradication of H. pylori on prevention or reduction of the risk of gastric cancer and to&#xD;
      assess whether the combination can reverse pre-cancerous lesions in the stomach in the&#xD;
      high-risk population. The proposed site is Shangdong, China with very high prevalence of&#xD;
      pre-cancerous lesions in asymptomatic H. pylori carriers. We plan to recruit 1500 H. pylori&#xD;
      positive subjects for this randomized placebo-controlled study. H. pylori carriers will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive treatment for the infection or placebo, followed by specific COX-2&#xD;
      inhibitor or placebo for 3 years. The results will have significant impact on prevention of&#xD;
      gastric cancer on a national scale and worldwide.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject demonstrates a willingness to participate in the study as indicated by written&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subject is at least 45 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject indicates a willingness to abstain from the use of all NSAIDs (including&#xD;
             over-the-counter products) and aspirin for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subject of childbearing potential has been using an effective means of&#xD;
             contraception for 1 week prior to the preliminary visit. She also has agreed to remain&#xD;
             abstinent, or to use oral birth control pills or single-barrier contraception (partner&#xD;
             using condom or subject using diaphragm, contraceptive sponge or IUD) beginning at the&#xD;
             preliminary visit and continuing till the end of the study. Women who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal or status post-hysterectomy or tubal ligation are exempt from this&#xD;
             requirement. (Postmenopausal is defined as no menses for the previous 1 year. If&#xD;
             cessation of menses is within 18 months, FSH must be documented as elevated into the&#xD;
             postmenopausal range before entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is judged to be in stable health based on medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and routine laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        According to medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has a bleeding diathesis or requires anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension. (Note: Subjects with medically controlled&#xD;
             hypertension [diastolic blood pressure &lt;95 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure &lt;165 mm Hg]&#xD;

             subjects with malignancy successfully treated &gt;10 years prior to screening, where, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator and treating physician, there has been no evidence of&#xD;
             recurrence from the time of treatment through the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             of the syndrome of nasal polyps, angioedema, and bronchospastic reactivity) to&#xD;
             aspirin, paracetamol, or other NSAIDs. NOTE: Subjects with a history of idiosyncratic&#xD;
             allergic reaction (e.g., rash) to a single NSAID in the past but who tolerated at&#xD;
             least 2 other NSAID medications without hypersensitivity reactions may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject is expected to need chronic NSAID treatment during the trial and/or subject&#xD;
             has been taking NSAIDs (including salicylates or other aspirin-containing compounds)&#xD;
             on a chronic basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has had ongoing or is expected to require treatment with any of the following:&#xD;
             Ticlopidine, clopidrogel, or regular doses of aspirin, including &quot;low-dose&quot; aspirin,&#xD;
             e.g., to prevent complications of vascular disease. Subjects may not discontinue an&#xD;
             established course of anti-platelet therapy in order to enter this study.&#xD;
