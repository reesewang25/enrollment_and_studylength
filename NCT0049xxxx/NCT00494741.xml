      The Mycophenolate Steroid Sparing (MYSS) study demonstrated that, in the setting of a&#xD;
      maintenance immunosuppressive regimen without steroids, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and&#xD;
      azathioprine (AZA) provided the same efficacy in preventing acute rejection episodes and&#xD;
      allograft dysfunction in kidney transplant recipients. Induction therapy with basiliximab&#xD;
      combined with low-dose thymoglobulin (RATG), through a transient depletion/inhibition of T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, allows further reducing the need for maintenance immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study is to assess whether under this induction strategy MMF and AZA are&#xD;
      equally effective in preventing acute rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), even&#xD;
      after cyclosporine (CsA) withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hundred-twenty-four kidney transplant recipients from deceased donors given induction&#xD;
      therapy with two 20 mg basiliximab injections 4 days apart and a seven-day course of RATG&#xD;
      (0.5 mg/kg/day), will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to 3-year treatment with low-dose&#xD;
      MMF or AZA, added-on CsA maintenance therapy. At 1 year, rejection-free patients with no&#xD;
      evidence of tubulitis at kidney biopsy will withdraw CsA and will have a kidney biopsy 3 year&#xD;
      post-transplant for evaluating the presence and severity of CAN. Should the cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of acute rejection exceed 15% during CsA withdrawal the study will be stopped.&#xD;
      Should the incidence differ by &gt;30% between the two treatment arms, all patients will be&#xD;
      given the most effective treatment and the follow up will be continued. A final biopsy will&#xD;
      be repeated 4 years post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients are expected to be effectively maintained on single drug immunosuppression,&#xD;
      which implies less steroid- and CsA- related complications and treatment costs. MMF is&#xD;
      expected to prevent CAN more effectively than AZA. However, should AZA be more or as&#xD;
      effective compared to MMF, at study end all patients could be shifted to AZA, that is 15-fold&#xD;
      less expensive than MMF. Extended to clinical practice, these findings should translate in&#xD;
      improved patient care and major cost-savings for the Health Care System.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The introduction of triple-therapy regimens that include a calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor, steroids, and azathioprine (AZA) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) greatly reduced&#xD;
      the risk of acute rejection in renal transplantation. However, the long-term use of both&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors and steroids is associated with serious toxicities that ultimately&#xD;
      impact patient and graft survival. Minimisation of chronic immunosuppression is therefore of&#xD;
      paramount importance to improve patient and graft survival. Thus, the quest for strategies&#xD;
      inducing specific immune hyporesponsiveness or even tolerance - ideally via short-term&#xD;
      interventions that would target only the pathogenic immune response and leave the protective&#xD;
      host immune response unimpaired - has provided a &quot;holy grail&quot; for transplant immunologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently found that induction therapy with basiliximab and lower (about one fourth) than&#xD;
      conventional doses of Rabbit Anti-human Thymocyte Globulin (RATG), combined to low-dose CsA&#xD;
      and MMF maintenance therapy, allowed ineffective prevention of acute rejection without&#xD;
      steroids. Of note, unlike induction protocols with &quot;standard&quot; RATG doses, the above regimen&#xD;
      was extremely well tolerated, avoided the risk of acute cytolysis reactions, reduced the&#xD;
      incidence of immuno-hemolytic anemia and the need for red blood cell transfusions. Moreover,&#xD;
      this approach did not increase the risk of CMV reactivations or lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      disorders, even as compared to standard triple immunosuppressive regimens without induction&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses of CsA employed in the above protocol were about half the doses currently used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. However, even these very low doses have been reported to have a&#xD;
      significant toxicity that, in the long-term, may adversely affect the graft function and&#xD;
      survival. Thus, implementing innovative immunosuppressive strategies allowing to early and&#xD;
      safely withdraw calcineurin inhibitor therapy might have major clinical implications in term&#xD;
      of improved kidney function and long term survival. This would also avoid the adverse effects&#xD;
      of chronic CsA therapy on arterial blood pressure, lipid profile and blood glucose that,&#xD;
      altogether, remarkably increase the overall cardiovascular risk in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose, induction therapy with basiliximab plus low-dose RATG might help inducing a&#xD;
      condition of reduced immuno-responsiveness that might allow to sequentially withdraw steroids&#xD;
      and CsA without adversely affect the outcome of the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence that MMF suppresses the production of anti-HLA antibodies, inhibits the recruitment&#xD;
      of mononuclear cells into the allograft, as well as the proliferation of arterial smooth&#xD;
      muscle cells, has been taken to suggest that MMF might play an important protective effect&#xD;
      against the development and progression of CAN. Thus, an immunosuppressive regimen based on&#xD;
      low-dose MMF as sole antirejection drug not only would avoid chronic toxicity of steroids,&#xD;
      and calcineurin inhibitors, but would also limit the risk of CAN, the main cause of allograft&#xD;
      loss in the long-term. On the other hand, however, the Mycophenolate Steroid Sparing (MYSS)&#xD;
      trial found that AZA was as effective as MMF in preventing acute allograft rejection in&#xD;
      CsA-treated kidney transplant recipients, even after steroid withdrawal. Since acute&#xD;
      allograft rejection is one of the strongest predictor of CAN, these findings can be taken to&#xD;
      suggest that, in the long-term, AZA might share with MMF also a similar protective effect&#xD;
      against the development of CAN. Moreover, it must be emphasized that chronic CsA&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity is a major component of CAN. Thus, the prevalence and severity of CAN may be&#xD;
      reduced in patients on CsA-free immunosuppressive regimens. In this clinical setting, the&#xD;
      benefits of MMF against the development of CAN might not appreciably exceed those of AZA.&#xD;
      Should this be the case, AZA might confer the same benefits of MMF, but at remarkably lower&#xD;
      costs since, at equivalent doses, AZA is about 15 times less expensive than MMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the above, MMF or AZA monotherapy would avoid or limit most of the&#xD;
      complications of chronic immunosuppressive regimens including steroids and calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitors, such as metabolic, osteomuscular and cardiovascular diseases, cancer and&#xD;
      opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS Primary To compare the incidence of CAN 3 years post-transplantation in patients&#xD;
      receiving induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG and randomized to maintenance&#xD;
