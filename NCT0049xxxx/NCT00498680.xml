    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, 3-arm parallel trial on 45 males with ED that were never exposed&#xD;
      to PDE5i therapy (naïve patients) will be enrolled.In each group, every patient will receive&#xD;
      three treatment regimes (Viagra®50mg &amp; Levitra®10mg, Viagra®100mg, Levitra®20mg), in&#xD;
      different sequences of administration in such a manner that eventually each patient will&#xD;
      receive all regimes in a double- blinded fasion.Safety will be evaluated at pre- screening by&#xD;
      measuring hourly vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate)for 4 consecutive hours after taking&#xD;
      half-dose combination. Any decrease in blood pressure of 20 mmhg below baseline will exclude&#xD;
      the subject from the study. Effcacy will be evaluated by questionnaires (IIEF, Quality of&#xD;
      erection questionnaire, grade of erection scale, Sear, QVS and Sexual Encounter Profiles for&#xD;
      each sexual event). Non-parametric statistical analysis of the collected data Comparing the 3&#xD;
      groups will be performed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, 3-arm parallel trial on 45 males with ED that were never exposed&#xD;
      to PDE5i therapy (naïve patients) will be enrolled. Recruitment will be performed via&#xD;
      advertisement or by offering newly diagnosed naïve ED patients visiting the clinic to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, every patient will receive three treatment regimes (Viagra®50mg &amp;&#xD;
      Levitra®10mg, Viagra®100mg, Levitra®20mg), in different sequences of administration, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1) 15 naïve patients will start with Viagra®100mg, continue with Levitra®20mg and end&#xD;
      the study with combined Viagra®50mg &amp; Levitra®10mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2) 15 naïve patients will start with combined Viagra®50mg &amp; Levitra®10mg, continue with&#xD;
      Levitra®20mg and end the study with Viagra®100mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3) 15 naïve patients will start with Levitra®20mg, continue with Viagra®100mg and end&#xD;
      the study with combined Viagra®50mg &amp; Levitra®10mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: - Relationship with the same partner for at least 3 month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ranging between 35-65 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sexually active, (minimal frequency of one sexual encounter per 2 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IIEF ED domain score 22 and below. Exclusion criteria: - Subjects with premature&#xD;
           ejaculation as their main sexual complaint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with severe cardiovascular disease in the past 6 months, including cardiac&#xD;
           failure, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke or transient ischemic attack,&#xD;
           symptomatic or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with Contraindications to PDE5i therapy. Namely patients receiving treatment&#xD;
           with nitrate based medication or patients that for various reasons cannot take PDE5&#xD;
           inhibitors (severe hepatic diseases- cirrhosis or ALT (Alanine aminotransferase)&gt;2x&#xD;
           upper limit of normal), renal impairment (creatinine clearance &gt; 30ml/min) or known&#xD;
           hereditary degenerative retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa. ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g protease inhibitors&#xD;
           ritonavir and saquinavir, ketoconazole, itrakonazole, miconazole, nefazodone,&#xD;
           claritromycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and cimetidine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects mentally unfit for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY &amp; ELIGIBILITY VISIT. After a thorough explanation of the nature of the study and its&#xD;
      protocol and after understanding and signing the informed consent form. In this visit, each&#xD;
      subject will start the study by measuring basic blood pressure levels and pulse rate. Under&#xD;
      our supervision the subject will take the combined half dose as suggested. Blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring and pulse rate every half- hour at the clinic will be performed for 4 hours&#xD;
      (according to the pharmacokinetic properties of the medications) . Any recordings of 20 mmhg&#xD;
      below baseline will exclude the subject from the study. If no significant effect on blood&#xD;
      pressure will be noted, the subject will be eligible for inclusion in the study, and will be&#xD;
      invited for the FIRST visit 7 days later. ( a washout period of one week is sufficient to&#xD;
      eliminate any effect of one-time dosing of the combined half dose treatment). Each included&#xD;
      patient in the coming 6 visits will respond to the following pre-set sexual function and&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaires (Hebrew validated):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The full IIEF (International Index Erectile Function) standard Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The SEAR (Self-Esteem And Relationship) questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. QVS (Quality of Sexual Life) questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of erection questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Grade of erection scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, documentation of side-effects will be done and a physical examination (blood&#xD;
      pressure and pulse rate) will be done. A 24 hour mobile phone dedicated to patient inquiries&#xD;
      will be provided to each patient during the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: The subject will be offered, at random, for 4 attempts at home, either a combination&#xD;
      dose regime (Viagra®50mg &amp; Levitra®10mg, 4 tablets each) or 4 tablets of Viagra®100mg single&#xD;
      dose or 4 tablets of Levitra® 20 mg. The subject will also receive 6 SEP (Sexual Encounter&#xD;
      Profile) diaries to fill out at home after each sexual attempt. After 4 attempts the subject&#xD;
      will return for visit 2, will respond to the same questionnaires and an additional EDITS&#xD;
      (Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction) questionnaire. A new visit will be&#xD;
      rescheduled for 2 weeks later to allow a washout period. At visit 3 they will receive the 2nd&#xD;
      regime and 4 new SEP diaries, and after 4 attempts will return to visit 4, fill out the same&#xD;
      4 questionnaires. Again, a new visit will be rescheduled for 2 weeks later to allow a washout&#xD;
      period. On visit 5 they will return to receive the third treatment regime. Again, they will&#xD;
      receive 4 SEP diaries to fill out after each sexual attempt at home. At their final visit&#xD;
      (visit 6), in addition to the other 4 questionnaires, the patients will be required to&#xD;
      respond to a preference questionnaire regarding the preferred regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approximate timeline for performing the study for every patient is 1/2 a year from&#xD;
      recruitment. The estimated timeline for completion of the study is 16 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Only on inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** Washout period 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric statistical analysis of the collected data from the questionnaires will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
