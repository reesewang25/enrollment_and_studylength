  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if nimotuzumab provides a benefit in this type of cancer when given&#xD;
      in combination with irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long any good effects last.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How bad any side effects are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is to assess the Objective Response Rate (ORR) that the combination of&#xD;
      irinotecan and nimotuzumab will produce in patients with irinotecan-refractory metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence of Grade 2 or greater acneiform rash or infusion reaction,&#xD;
           allergic reaction or anaphylactoid reaction AEs in patients with irinotecan-refractory&#xD;
           metastatic colorectal cancer following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess Progression-Free Survival (PFS), defined as time from date of randomization&#xD;
           until date of disease progression (clinical or radiological) or death due to any cause,&#xD;
           for the two nimotuzumab schedules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the rates and durations of Stable Disease (SD) following weekly or 2-weekly&#xD;
           nimotuzumab schedules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the Time to Disease Progression (TTP) following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab&#xD;
           schedules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate ORR in patients who are identified as having &quot;primary&quot; irinotecan resistance&#xD;
           following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate Overall Survival (OS) following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the two dosing schedules of nimotuzumab with respect to objective response&#xD;
           rates and safety;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall safety and toxicity profiles of these two dose regimens of&#xD;
           nimotuzumab;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate trough levels and accumulation of nimotuzumab in serum of patients receiving&#xD;
           the drug on weekly or 2-weekly regimens.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient will receive nimotuzumab every 2 weeks plus irinotecan. Nimotuzumab will be given&#xD;
      at a dose of 400 mg once every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Irinotecan will be given at the same&#xD;
      dose and schedule as the last dose and schedule given during the most recent pre-study&#xD;
      irinotecan containing therapy. If the tumour does not show signs of further growth after 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment, the patient will continue receiving nimotuzumab 400 mg every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      up to 18 months or as long as they are getting a benefit from the drug.&#xD;
