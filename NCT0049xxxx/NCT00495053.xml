  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a new product that uses human gene&#xD;
      transfer (called hMaxi-K) when it is given to patients with overactive bladder. Human gene&#xD;
      transfer is a new type of therapy that is the process of placing genetic material (DNA or&#xD;
      RNA) into a person. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety parameters&#xD;
      occurring subsequent to administration of a single intravesical instillation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different dose groups of hMaxi-K will be tested in this study: 5000 and 10000 micrograms.&#xD;
      A 15000 microgram group was planned; however, the study was terminated before participants&#xD;
      were dosed. hMaxi-K will be given as a single administration into the bladder through a&#xD;
      catheter. Each women's participation in the study will last for up to 24 weeks (followed by&#xD;
      an additional 18-month follow-up period).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The safety parameters to be monitored include: adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, and physical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a single intravesical instillation of&#xD;
      hMaxi-K compared to the control group. Efficacy parameters that will be evaluated are: mean&#xD;
      number of micturitions per 24 hours, mean number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours,&#xD;
      mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours, overall maximum bladder capacity, number of&#xD;
      uninhibited contractions during the cystometry procedure, participant rating of urgency&#xD;
      score, participant rating of perceived bladder condition severity, participant assessment of&#xD;
      response to treatment, participant rating of Quality of Life (Kings Health Questionnaire),&#xD;
      SF-12 Health Survey, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ-SF), and&#xD;
      pad weight measurement of accidental bladder leaks.&#xD;

          -  Current history of neurological bladder dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A life expectancy of less than 12 months&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Latex allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stress urinary incontinence as determined by observation of the participant coughing&#xD;
             while standing with a full bladder and/or response of 2 or 3 on the following Stress&#xD;
             Urinary Incontinence question: Do you experience leakage when laughing, coughing,&#xD;
             lifting heavy objects or other types of discreet, moderately intense activities?&#xD;
             0=NONE: No leakage. 1=MILD: Minimal leakage on rare occasions during these types of&#xD;
             activities; easily tolerated; do not use pads for this. 2=MODERATE: Enough leakage&#xD;
             that it requires occasional use of pads and may interfere with usual activity and&#xD;
             tasks. 3=SEVERE: Extreme leakage and discomfort that stops all activity and tasks and&#xD;
             requires the use of pads on all occasions&#xD;
