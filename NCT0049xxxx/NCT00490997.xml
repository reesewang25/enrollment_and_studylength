      The objective of this study is to compare Ketamine-Propofol with Ketamine-only in a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomised, controlled trial in a paediatric emergency department. We believe&#xD;
      that the combination of these two agents will provide a new and more effective option for&#xD;
      procedural sedation in paediatric emergency department patients. The hypothesis of the study&#xD;
      is that paediatric emergency department patients requiring procedural sedation for an&#xD;
      isolated orthopaedic injury with Ketamine-Propofol will have reduced total sedation time,&#xD;
      time to recovery, complications and improved satisfaction scores compared to patients&#xD;
      receiving Ketamine alone.&#xD;

      Purpose: Procedural sedation has become an essential skill for emergency physicians, allowing&#xD;
      for completion of painful procedures in a safe, comfortable and efficient manner. The ideal&#xD;
      sedative agent would allow for an effective level of sedation, rapid onset and offset,&#xD;
      absence of hemodynamic or respiratory compromise, and lack of post procedural side effects. A&#xD;
      variety of agents have been studied for paediatric procedural sedation, however no currently&#xD;
      used agent meets all of these criteria (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Ketamine and Propofol are two agents that have been well studied and are commonly&#xD;
      utilized as single agents for sedation. Ketamine is a dissociative agent that has amnestic&#xD;
      and analgesic qualities. It has the unique property of allowing for deep sedation with&#xD;
      minimal effects on the patient's respiratory drive. Ketamine use does not cause hypotension&#xD;
      and in fact can have a positive effect on blood pressure. Ketamine has been extensively&#xD;
      studied in paediatric sedation and has been found to be a safe and effective (2,3,4). Side&#xD;
      effects associated with Ketamine use include post procedural nausea and vomiting, and&#xD;
      unpleasant emergence phenomena such as agitation or hallucinations. Ketamine sedation can&#xD;
      result in prolonged recovery times compared to other sedative agents and has a low rate of&#xD;
      respiratory depression, apnea and laryngospasm (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent that has been popular for use in adult and paediatric&#xD;
      procedural sedation for over a decade. The agent's rapid onset of effect and short duration&#xD;
      of action allow for efficient sedation and recovery. Propofol has antiemetic properties and&#xD;
      post-procedural side effects are rare. Caution must be used with Propofol, as it can be&#xD;
      associated with significant respiratory depression and/or hypotension (1). The prolonged use&#xD;
      of Propofol in children can produce acidosis, but this is not a problem for single use for an&#xD;
      acute painful procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have demonstrated that the combination of Ketamine and Propofol for&#xD;
      sedation is safe and effective, with most of the data in adults or in adult-child studies&#xD;
      with small number of children (5,6). The combination of the two agents appears to reduce side&#xD;
      effects of each medication used alone, and allows for a rapid recovery time. A prospective&#xD;
      case series of Canadian emergency department patients given Ketamine-Propofol for procedural&#xD;
      sedation has recently been published (5). In this study, 22% of the patients were children.&#xD;
      However, to date there has been no targeted research published comparing Ketamine-Propofol&#xD;
      head to head with any other presently utilized sedation regimen in a paediatric emergency&#xD;
      department setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective &amp; Hypothesis: The objective of this study is to compare Ketamine-Propofol with&#xD;
      Ketamine-only in a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial in a paediatric emergency&#xD;
      department. We believe that the combination of these two agents will provide a novel and more&#xD;
      efficacious option for procedural sedation in paediatric emergency department patients. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is paediatric emergency department patients requiring procedural&#xD;
      sedation for an isolated orthopaedic injury with Ketamine-Propofol will have reduced total&#xD;
      sedation time, time to recovery, complications and improved satisfaction scores compared to&#xD;
      patients receiving Ketamine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: This study will be a prospective, double-blind, randomised, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial with an expected enrolment of approximately 140 patients from June-October&#xD;
      2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 2 * (Z1-α/2 + Z1-β)2 * σ2 / ∆2&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 2 * (1.96 + 0.84)2 * 202 / 102&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 2 * 7.84 * 400 / 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 62.7 or 63 per group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the calculation above, 63 children are needed in each group to have an 80% chance of&#xD;
      detecting a clinically meaningful difference in total sedation time of 10 minutes between the&#xD;
      groups, assuming an alpha of 0.05, and a standard deviation of 20 minutes. We have added an&#xD;
      additional 7 patients (10%) to each group to account for potential drop-outs. Written,&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from a parent/guardian for all children that meet the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Additionally, all children over the age of eight will also be asked for&#xD;
      their assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: After giving informed consent, eligible patients will be assigned to either&#xD;
      the Ketamine-Propofol group or Ketamine-placebo group through random allocation. Sealed&#xD;
      envelopes containing a randomized assignment to either Ketamine-Propofol or Ketamine-only&#xD;
      group will be prepared by an individual unconnected with the study using a web-based random&#xD;
      number generator, balanced to ensure equal allocation to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Ketamine-only group will receive an intravenous dose of 1.0 mg/kg Ketamine&#xD;
      and patients in the Ketamine-Propofol group will receive an intravenous dose of 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      Ketamine and 1.0 mg/kg Propofol at time zero. Two minutes after the initial dose of sedative&#xD;
      agent, and every 2 minutes thereafter, the attending physician will assess the patient's&#xD;
      level of sedation using the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Sedation Scale (Appendix A). If&#xD;
      the attending physician determines the level of sedation is not adequate (Sedation score ≥&#xD;
      3), additional study drugs (Ketamine group: 0.25 mg/kg Ketamine; Ketamine-Propofol group: 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg Propofol) will be administered every 2 minutes until adequate sedation is achieved&#xD;
      (deep conscious sedation = Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Sedation Scale Score &lt; 3). Once a&#xD;
      sedation score &lt; 3 is achieved, the procedure will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sedation will be performed under continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring based on current&#xD;
      hospital guidelines under the care and surveillance of a pediatric emergency department&#xD;
      registered nurse and physician. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory&#xD;
      rate and oxygen saturation will be monitored continuously and recorded every 2 minutes, with&#xD;
      the exception of blood pressure, which will be recorded every 4 minutes. The assisting&#xD;
      registered nurse will also record information regarding time of last liquid and solid intake&#xD;
      and body weight on the hospital's standard procedural sedation and analgesia record form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate, standardized datasheet (Appendix B) will be used to collect the time when the&#xD;
      study drug was first administered, the time when the procedure began, the time the procedure&#xD;
      was completed and the time to recovery. Upon completion of the procedure, a recovery score&#xD;
      based on a modified Aldrete Scale, will be recorded by a research associate blinded as to the&#xD;
      intervention used every 2 minutes until full recovery, defined as a minimum cumulative score&#xD;
      of 8. The attending physician will be asked to document any complications (including&#xD;
      hypotension, apnea, hypoxia, laryngospasm and pain on injection) that occurred during the&#xD;
      procedure and if any interventions were necessary. The nurse caring for the patient will also&#xD;
      record any adverse events (nausea, vomiting, agitation) that occurred during recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome will be total sedation time, defined as the time that&#xD;
      the first study drug was injected until the patient is fully recovered with a minimum&#xD;
      recovery score ≥ 8. Secondary outcomes will include time to recovery; patient, nurse, and&#xD;
      physician satisfaction; complications and adverse events. The patient, nurse and physician&#xD;
      will be asked to individually assess their level of satisfaction with the sedation procedure&#xD;
      using a 7-point Likert scale (Appendices C-E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses Strategy: The independent samples t-test will be used to compare differences in mean&#xD;
      total sedation time and recovery time between the Ketamine and Ketamine-Propofol groups. The&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare differences in satisfaction levels (measured on an&#xD;
      ordinal scale) between groups. Differences in proportions of complications during the&#xD;
      procedure and adverse events during recovery will be assessed by the Chi-Square test between&#xD;
      groups. A p value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectation: The expectation of the study is paediatric emergency department patients&#xD;
      requiring procedural sedation for an isolated orthopaedic injury with Ketamine-Propofol will&#xD;
      have reduced total sedation time, time to recovery, complications and improved satisfaction&#xD;
      scores compared to patients receiving Ketamine alone.&#xD;
