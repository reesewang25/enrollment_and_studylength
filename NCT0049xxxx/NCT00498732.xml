      Specific Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To verify the differentially expressed genes and pathways between normal and OSA&#xD;
           patients, and OSA patients before and after CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Genes with changes in expression of more than two-fold between normal and OSA patients&#xD;
           as well as OSA patients before and after CPAP treatment were thought as confirmed and&#xD;
           were selected for further validation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate the confirmed genes with the clinical presentations and CPAP effects in&#xD;
           another 50 OSAS subjects to validate the altered gene expressions and pathways involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To investigate the correlation of genes confirmed from RT-PCR (identified gene), another&#xD;
           50 OSAS subjects are included in the study. We analyze the correlation between&#xD;
           identified gene and the clinical manifestations and CPAP effect in these 50 OSAS&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a cell model to investigate the differentially expressed genes and the&#xD;
           putative biological pathways involved in OSA syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the functions of genes identified in the first and second year (gene of&#xD;
      interest), we establish a cell model with human monocyte cell line U937. We investigate the&#xD;
      function of gene of interest through overexpress or knockdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The objectives of this project are to confirm the gene profiled from comparing&#xD;
      normal and OSA patients as well as OSA patients before and after CPAP treatment, to&#xD;
      investigate the correlation between altered gene expression and clinical presentations and&#xD;
      CPAP effects of the OSAS and to identify and confirm corresponding pathway. This study will&#xD;
      enhance our understanding of the individual constitution on widely different clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and therapeutic variations. All these efforts will also help us to interpret&#xD;
      its molecular mechanisms and develop prediction and diagnosis strategies of OSAS. The&#xD;
      long-term objectives are to develop therapeutic strategy other than CPAP of OSAS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized with recurrent collapse of upper&#xD;
      airway during sleep and resulted in hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, which resulted in&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders and neurocognitive dysfunctions. The&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications attributed to OSAS included hypertension, coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, heart failure and stroke. The mechanisms responsible for developments of&#xD;
      cardiovascular sequelae included repeated episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia, exaggerated&#xD;
      negative intrathoracic pressure and bursts of sympathetic activity provoking surges in blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate. Increase of inflammatory mediators, which included C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, oxidative stress, adhesion molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor and&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, were thought to involve in the developments of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases in patients with OSAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To clarify the exact mechanisms of OSAS and the linkage to cardiovascular complications, in&#xD;
      our previous study, we used oligo microarray to genome-wide profile the gene expression&#xD;
      patterns in OSAS patients and the changes of gene expressions before and after four-week CPAP&#xD;
      treatment. The oligo-microarray data were processed with CRSD database and two-way&#xD;
      hierarchical clustering method. The results showed the gene expression patterns were&#xD;
      different between control subjects and OSA patients and CPAP treatment also altered the gene&#xD;
      expression patterns. Totally 27 genes and four pathways were identified as target genes and&#xD;
      pathways from comparing the gene pattern changes before and after CPAP treatment, which&#xD;
      included apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, cell adhesion and activation and metabolism.&#xD;
      To continue analyzing the gene pattern changes before and after CPAP treatment, we propose&#xD;
      this three-year project to achieve the following goals: (1) To verify the differentially&#xD;
      expressed genes and pathways between normal and OSA patients, and OSA patients before and&#xD;
      after CPAP treatment. (2) To correlate the confirmed genes with the clinical presentations&#xD;
      and CPAP effects in another 50 OSAS subjects to validate the altered gene expressions and&#xD;
      pathways involved. (3) To establish a cell model to investigate the differentially expressed&#xD;
      genes and the putative biological pathways involved in OSA syndrome. The information obtained&#xD;
      by this approach is very useful to understand the pathogenic mechanism of OSA that leads to&#xD;
      systemic complications and further therapeutic intervention may therefore be possible.&#xD;

        From patients who were referred to sleep lab for suspect sleep apnea, we selected 50 male&#xD;
        patients with age&gt; 18 y/o. with severe OSAS, which were confirmed with by overnight PSG.&#xD;
        All were free from neurologic events, chronic pulmonary disease, active infection and&#xD;
        substance abuse. Female patients and patients under 18 y/o were excluded. All 50 subjects&#xD;
        were treated with 4-week CPAP. All study subjects were admitted, on the day of baseline&#xD;
        measurement and four weeks after CPAP use, for clinical evaluation, blood sampling and PSG.&#xD;
        And all anti-hypertensive therapy was remained unchanged during the 4-week follow-up&#xD;
        period. Changes of parameters, before and after CPAP treatment, were compared between two&#xD;
        groups.&#xD;
