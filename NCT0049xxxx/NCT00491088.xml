      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To prove our hypothesis that in severe OSA patients without daytime sleepiness, CPAP&#xD;
           worked as effectively as in severe OSA patients with daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using sham CPAP as the optimal placebo, we conduct a randomized double-blind placebo&#xD;
           controlled trial to assess the CPAP effect in severe OSA patients without daytime&#xD;
           sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish a model to predict the CPAP effect We use the parameters of five aspects,&#xD;
           including changes of polysomnographic parameters, improvement of sleepiness, fatigue and&#xD;
           QOL, sympathetic activity, inflammatory mediators and metabolism, to establish a model&#xD;
           to predict CPAP effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease, which affects 4% middle-aged men and 2%&#xD;
      women. Daytime sleepiness is one of the symptoms of OSA which drive patients to seek medical&#xD;
      help. Sleepiness in OSA has been reported to be raised by microarousal, altered sleep&#xD;
      structure and somnogenic cytokine and modifications in body metabolism. The assessments of&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness included objective measures, like multiple sleep latency test and&#xD;
      subjective measures, like Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment for patients&#xD;
      with severe OSA. CPAP could improve daytime wakefulness, blood pressure and quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL). Several studies tried to identify factors predicting the CPAP effect and most&#xD;
      concluded CPAP was not effective for patients with high apnea-hypopnea index but not sleepy.&#xD;
      All of them determine the CPAP effect in terms of daytime function, lowering of blood&#xD;
      pressure and QOL. None of these studies evaluate the CPAP effects in terms of improvement of&#xD;
      sympathetic hyperactivity, inflammatory mediators and metabolic abnormalities. Therefore, we&#xD;
      assumed patients whose daytime functions didn't improve after CPAP treatment still possibly&#xD;
      got benefit from altering factors contributing to cardiovascular consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous study showed that CPAP effect in OSA patients without sleepiness was as well as&#xD;
      in patients with sleepiness, except that plasma level of norepinephrine and 24hr mean&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure could be lowered more in patients with sleepiness. However, without&#xD;
      optimal placebo and randomization, the actual role of CPAP in treating non-sleepy OSA&#xD;
      patients still couldn't be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently sham CPAP was developed, which mimicked all the characteristics of a true CPAP&#xD;
      except for the null pressure applied to the upper airway of the patient. Moreover, sham CPAP&#xD;
      doesn't influence sleep efficiency, arousals, or apnea-hypopnea index. Therefore, in this&#xD;
      project, using sham CPAP as a placebo, we propose a randomized double-blind placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of CPAP in severe OSA patients without daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness. We also establish a model to predict the CPAP effect. The results would change&#xD;
      the current practice of managing severe OSA patients without daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
