      TDSM will study the physiology of testosterone in women ages 21-60 who have had surgical&#xD;
      menopause (uterus and both ovaries removed). Testosterone is commonly thought of as a &quot;male&#xD;
      hormone&quot; thus being that it is the male's primary hormone. Women produce testosterone in much&#xD;
      smaller amounts and despite this, testosterone still plays a significant role. Fifty percent&#xD;
      of a women's testosterone is made in her adrenal glands (glands that sit on top of the&#xD;
      kidneys) and fifty percent is made in her ovaries. When a woman has her ovaries removed it is&#xD;
      thought that her testosterone levels decrease rapidly and significantly. This study will be&#xD;
      examining testosterone's role in sexual function, general well being, muscle performance,&#xD;
      cognitive function, carbohydrate metabolism and muscle and fat distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is 14 months long with weekly to monthly visits. The subjects will be placed on the&#xD;
      estrogen patch for the duration of the study. They will also be given weekly injections of&#xD;
      testosterone or placebo for 6 months. During the testosterone treatment phase the women will&#xD;
      be separated into 5 groups. The groups include a dose of testosterone that is very low, low,&#xD;
      medium, high and placebo. A placebo looks and feels similar to testosterone; however it does&#xD;
      not have testosterone in it. We use this to test if the subject is having a response to the&#xD;
      testosterone itself or the thought of receiving testosterone. Neither the subject nor the&#xD;
      investigators will know the dose until the end of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In healthy women the primary hormones produced by the ovaries are estrogens and progesterone,&#xD;
      but they also produce testosterone both before and after menopause. Although normal blood&#xD;
      levels of testosterone in women are much lower than in men, testosterone is thought to have&#xD;
      important physiologic effects in women, particularly on muscle function, body composition,&#xD;
      sexual function and cognitive function. When women require bilateral oophorectomy (removal of&#xD;
      ovaries), they subsequently have a significant drop in serum testosterone levels. They also&#xD;
      frequently experience a decreased sense of well being, and decreased sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While treatment with testosterone and other androgens has been widely promoted for women with&#xD;
      low serum levels, there is little available data on the effects of such treatment&#xD;
      particularly when given in physiologic doses (doses resulting in normal blood levels for&#xD;
      women). Studies that have demonstrated benefits of testosterone in women have often used&#xD;
      doses of testosterone which resulted in higher than normal serum testosterone levels. At such&#xD;
      doses, testosterone and other androgens can produce virilizing side effects such as increased&#xD;
      facial and body hair, acne, increased size of the clitoris and changes in the voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known whether physiologic testosterone replacement can provide the benefits seen&#xD;
      with higher doses in women with androgen deficiency without the limiting, virilizing side&#xD;
      effects. It has been assumed that testosterone dose-response relationships are different in&#xD;
      women than in men, and that clinically significant effects on psycho-sexual function, body&#xD;
      composition, muscle performance, cognitive function, and other health-related outcomes can be&#xD;
      achieved at testosterone doses and concentrations that are substantially lower than those&#xD;
      required to produce similar effects in men; however, these assumptions have not been tested&#xD;
      rigorously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to establish testosterone dose-response&#xD;
      relationships in surgically menopausal women with low testosterone concentrations for a range&#xD;
      of androgen-dependent outcomes, including sexual function, fat-free mass, thigh muscle&#xD;
      strength and leg power, several domains of neurocognitive function, plasma lipids,&#xD;
      apolipoproteins and lipoprotein particles, and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine the range of testosterone doses and subsequent plasma&#xD;
      testosterone concentrations that are associated with improvements in sexual, physical and&#xD;
      neurocognitive functions and that can be safely administered to women without significant&#xD;
      adverse effects on hair growth, voice, sebum production, clitoral size, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Testosterone administration in surgically menopausal women with low testosterone&#xD;
           concentrations is associated with dose- and concentration-dependent improvements in&#xD;
           sexual function and sexual activity scores, specific domains of cognitive function,&#xD;
           fat-free mass, thigh muscle strength, and leg power.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testosterone dose-response relationships are different for different androgen dependent&#xD;
           processes. While some domains of sexual function are normalized by testosterone&#xD;
           concentrations at the upper end of the normal range for healthy, young women,&#xD;
           significant gains in fat-free mass, thigh muscle strength and power would require higher&#xD;
           testosterone doses than those required to induce changes in sexual function.&#xD;
