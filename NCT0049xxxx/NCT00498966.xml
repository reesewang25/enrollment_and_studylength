      This is a Phase II study. Patients with kidney carcinoma will be considered in two groups.&#xD;
      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure clinical benefit defined as tumor response or progression-free survival for&#xD;
           more than 12 weeks in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the kidney who have failed&#xD;
           or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of perifosine in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the kidney&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study. Patients with kidney carcinoma will be considered in two groups.&#xD;
      Patients in group A will have previously failed a VEGF receptor inhibitor but not an mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitor, while patients in group B will have failed both a VEGF receptor inhibitor and an&#xD;
      mTOR inhibitor. Evaluation of each group will be performed separately. The goals of this&#xD;
      study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure clinical benefit defined as an objective tumor response using RESIST or&#xD;
           progression-free survival for more than 12 weeks in patients with metastatic carcinoma&#xD;
           of the kidney who have failed or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety of perifosine in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the kidney&#xD;
           who have failed or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase/duration of treatment: All patients will be treated with daily perifosine at&#xD;
      100 mg PO daily until tumor progression (by the RECIST criteria) or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Once radiological disease progression has been documented by the treating physician, the&#xD;
      patient will go off study. Patients are encouraged to have two measurements for confirmation&#xD;
      of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Phase: All patients will be followed-up for SAEs until at least 30 days after&#xD;
      discontinuation of perifosine. All patients who are discontinued from perifosine for any&#xD;
      reason other than disease progression will continue to have tumor assessments until the&#xD;
      patient has documented disease progression or has begun other therapies.&#xD;
