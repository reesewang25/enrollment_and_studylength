      1. What are the characteristics of joint replacement patients (DRGs 209 &amp; 210) served in&#xD;
           IRFs and SNFs? How are they similar or different?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How are the interventions and processes of care for joint replacement patients different&#xD;
           in IRFs and SNFs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What specific interventions or combinations of interventions in IRFs and SNFs make the&#xD;
           biggest difference in outcomes for joint replacement patients taking into account&#xD;
           patient differences?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Which joint replacement patients do better in an IRF and which do better in a SNF?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the relative cost-effectiveness of IRF and SNF care for joint replacement&#xD;
           patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Are comorbidities among joint replacement patients an adequate indicator of additional&#xD;
           medical need during the rehabilitation process? Can a severity-of-illness measure serve&#xD;
           as a better indicator of medical need? Are patients with greater medical needs served&#xD;
           better in an IRF or a SNF?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Can we design a more efficient course of rehabilitation interventions for joint&#xD;
           replacement patients in IRFs and SNFs to reduce the length of stay and costs?&#xD;

      1. What are the characteristics of joint replacement patients (DRGs 209 &amp; 210) served in&#xD;
           IRFs and SNFs? How are they similar or different?&#xD;
&#xD;
           We need to know if there are systematic differences among joint replacement patients&#xD;
           served in both settings and take these into account when evaluating outcomes and cost&#xD;
           effectiveness as outlined below. See also Question 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How are the interventions and processes of care for joint replacement patients different&#xD;
           in IRFs and SNFs?&#xD;
&#xD;
           How can we best characterize the differences in the care received in an IRF vs. a SNF?&#xD;
           What makes the care in an IRF and a SNF different? What do they do similarly and what do&#xD;
           they do differently? Consider all interventions, e.g., nursing services, physician&#xD;
           interventions, physical and occupational therapies, nutritional support, medications,&#xD;
           passive motion exercises, weight-bearing exercises. Also consider timing, intensity,&#xD;
           frequency, and duration of therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What specific interventions or combinations of interventions in IRFs and SNFs make the&#xD;
           biggest difference in outcomes for joint replacement patients taking into account&#xD;
           patient differences?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The relevant outcomes for this study include: (1) the onset of complications during the&#xD;
           course of treatment, (2) change in severity of illness from admission to discharge, (3)&#xD;
           discharge destination (including unscheduled discharges to acute care), and (4) change&#xD;
           in functional status from admission to discharge. We will consider (5)&#xD;
           rehospitalizations or readmissions in the first 3-6 months following discharge from&#xD;
           post-acute care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Which joint replacement patients do better in an IRF and which do better in a SNF?&#xD;
&#xD;
           How can we best characterize the differences between patients who do better in one&#xD;
           setting or the other? How can these characterizations assist in developing post-acute&#xD;
           placement criteria and in characterizing the patient mix that should be used in defining&#xD;
           an IRF pursuant to the 75% rule?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the relative cost-effectiveness of IRF and SNF care for joint replacement&#xD;
           patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
           For which patients is it more cost-effective to be placed in an IRF and which patients&#xD;
           in a SNF taking into account outcomes both at discharge and rehospitalizations during&#xD;
           the first 3-6 months following discharge?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Are comorbidities among joint replacement patients an adequate indicator of additional&#xD;
           medical need during the rehabilitation process? Can a severity-of-illness measure serve&#xD;
           as a better indicator of medical need? Are patients with greater medical needs served&#xD;
           better in an IRF or a SNF?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Do comorbidities or a severity of illness indicator have better predictive validity in&#xD;
           terms of service utilization, costs, and outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Can we design a more efficient course of rehabilitation interventions for joint&#xD;
           replacement patients in IRFs and SNFs to reduce the length of stay and costs?&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are 21 years of age or older,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a hip or knee replacement of any type for any reason, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted from any source.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be included in the study's database, the above enrollment criteria need to be met. In&#xD;
        addition, patients also must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a minimum rehabilitation length of stay (LOS) of 3 days, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have complete admission and discharge FIM data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Joint replacements such as shoulder and ankle replacements since the rehabilitation&#xD;
             for these patients is quite different. For most study patients, the joint replacement&#xD;
             will be their first, but with the aging of the population, revisions are becoming more&#xD;
             common. According to the MedPAC-RAND report, 4.8% of IRF and 6.3% of SNF joint&#xD;
             replacement patients had a revision.&#xD;
