    <textblock>
      Nephropathy of type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      world-wide and is associated with a dramatic excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Two randomized trials found that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of ESRD by about 30%, but have no appreciable effects on cardiovascular mortality. Available&#xD;
      data suggest that ACE inhibitors might be similarly renoprotective and even more&#xD;
      cardioprotective, but large scale trials on ACE inhibitors, alone or combined with ARBs, in&#xD;
      overt nephropathy of type 2 diabetes are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the effects, at comparable blood pressure control (systolic/diastolic&#xD;
      &lt;130/80 mmHg), of dual renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) blockade by half dose of benazepril and&#xD;
      valsartan combination therapy as compared to single RAS blockade by benazepril or valsartan&#xD;
      alone at full dose, 20 mg and 160 mg respectively, on ESRD and cardiovascular events in&#xD;
      high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy, defined as serum creatinine&#xD;
      &gt;1.8 mg/dl and &lt; 3.2 mg/dl and spot morning urine albumin to creatinine ratio &gt;1000mg/g for&#xD;
      the patients without previous ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy and &gt;500mg/g for the patients&#xD;
      with previous ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy and no specific contraindications to the study&#xD;
      drugs. The relationships between renal and cardiovascular outcomes will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      102 patients will be treated for at least 3 years. At comparable blood pressure control, the&#xD;
      study is expected to show a more effective reduction in ESRD and cardiovascular events with&#xD;
      combined than with single drug ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. As compared to ARB, ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy is expected to have a similar effect on ESRD, but a superior&#xD;
      cardioprotective effect. Applied to clinical practice, the findings should help reducing&#xD;
      renal and cardiovascular complications, and related treatment costs, of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Nephropathy of type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD). Currently, more than 50% of patients on renal replacement therapy in the US are&#xD;
      diabetics. The yearly incidence of diabetics progressing to ESRD and the proportion of ESRD&#xD;
      patients with diabetes is progressively increasing due to the progressively increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two large, multinational trials in overt nephropathy of type 2 diabetes found that&#xD;
      interruption of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin II receptor blockers&#xD;
      (ARBs) reduces the incidence of ESRD by about 30%, but has no appreciable effects on&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality. On the basis of these findings, ARB therapy has become standard&#xD;
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. However, despite ARB treatment,&#xD;
      about 7% of patients continue to progress to ESRD and 7% continue to die every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large-scale randomized trials evaluating the nephro- and cardio-protective effects of RAS&#xD;
      inhibition with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in overt nephropathy of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes are missing. However, studies in patients with type 1 diabetic nephropathy showed&#xD;
      that ACE inhibitor therapy may decrease progression to ESRD by 40% and cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality by about 50%. Similar studies in non diabetic chronic nephropathies. consistently&#xD;
      found a 40-50% reduction in the risk of progression to ESRD with ACE inhibitors as compared&#xD;
      to non-RAS inhibitor therapy. Moreover, a meta-analysis of studies including type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients with different degree of renal involvement showed that ACE inhibitors and ARBs&#xD;
      sheared a similar renoprotective effect, but only ACE inhibitors significantly decreased the&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent trial in non diabetic nephropathies found that combined RAS inhibition with ARBs and&#xD;
      ACE inhibitors decreases progression to ESRD by 50% as compared to ARB or ACE inhibition&#xD;
      alone. Evidence that combined therapy more effectively than ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy&#xD;
      alone reduces albuminuria or proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, suggests that a&#xD;
      similar renoprotective effect could be achieved also in overt nephropathy of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Indeed, short-term proteinuria reduction is a strong predictor of slower progression of renal&#xD;
      disease and reduced cardiovascular mortality in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized trial powered to detect a reduced incidence of ESRD or cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      with combined ARB and ACE inhibition as compared to ACE inhibition or ARB alone would require&#xD;
      several thousands of patients. However, identifying high risk patients who may benefit the&#xD;
      most of nephro- and cardio-protective therapy would allow to design an adequately powered&#xD;
      trial with remarkably less patients. By using a Bayesian decision-tree analysis we&#xD;
      identified, among patients included in the RENAAL study, a subgroup of high risk patients&#xD;
      with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dl or more and spot morning urine albumin to&#xD;
      creatinine ratio &gt;1000mg/g or more. Of note, over 3.5 year follow-up, 70% of these high-risk&#xD;
      patients progressed to ESRD despite ARB therapy. Thus, the incidence of ESRD was three-fold&#xD;
      higher in high-risk patients (20%) than in the whole study group (6.8%). High risk patients&#xD;
      with these clinical characteristics are therefore the ideal target for randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials aimed to evaluate the effect of novel nephro- and, possibly, cardio-protective&#xD;
      treatments in overt nephropathy of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, whether dual more than single drug RAS blockade reduces the need for renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy in high risk patients with type 2 diabetes and whether ACE inhibitors shear with ARBs&#xD;
      a similar or even superior beneficial effect in this typology of patients is worth&#xD;
      investigating. This could be of clinical relevance in these terms: 1. Effective prevention of&#xD;
      ESRD in people with type 2 diabetes is expected to translate in a remarkable reduction in&#xD;
      costs for renal replacement therapy by chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation; 2. A&#xD;
      better definition of the cost/effectiveness profile of different study treatments may help&#xD;
      optimizing the allocation of available resources in order to achieve more effective&#xD;
      prevention at lower costs. 3. The definition of individual risk profiles may allows&#xD;
      identifying subjects at increased risk that may benefit the most of intensified treatment,&#xD;
      which should translate in a further optimization of the use of available resources at&#xD;
      population level. Moreover, in addition to verify whether dual RAS blockade by combined ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor and ARB treatment more effectively than single drug RAS blockade may prevent&#xD;
      progression to ESRD, the present study will offer the opportunity to compare the&#xD;
      renoprotective effects of equivalent doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Primary To evaluate whether, at comparable blood pressure control, dual RAS blockade&#xD;
      with combined therapy with halved doses of benazepril (10 mg/day) and valsartan (160 mg/day)&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of ESRD more effectively than single drug RAS blockade by full doses of&#xD;
      valsartan (320 mg/day) given alone in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes and overt&#xD;
      nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether, at comparable blood pressure control, dual RAS blockade with&#xD;
           combined therapy with halved doses of benazepril (10 mg/day) and valsartan (160 mg/day)&#xD;
           reduces the incidence of ESRD more effectively than single drug RAS blockade by full&#xD;
           doses of benazepril (20 mg/day) given alone in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
           and overt nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether, at comparable blood pressure control, the effects of benazepril and&#xD;
           valsartan therapy are similar or whether, alternatively, one of the two treatments&#xD;
           offers a superior protective effect against the progression to ESRD in the above study&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of the three study treatments on the incidence of fatal and&#xD;
           non-fatal cardiovascular events, doubling of baseline serum creatinine, GFR decline and&#xD;
           proteinuria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationships, in the study group as a whole and within each treatment&#xD;
           group, between renal outcome variables (ESRD, doubling serum creatinine, GFR decline,&#xD;
           proteinuria) and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, between achieved blood&#xD;
           pressure or metabolic control and renal and/or cardiovascular outcome variables and&#xD;
           between achieved proteinuria reduction or residual follow-up proteinuria and renal&#xD;
           and/or cardiovascular outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This will be a multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Open label, Blinded End point&#xD;
      (PROBE) trial of 3-year treatment with halved doses of benazepril (10 mg/day) and valsartan&#xD;
      (160 mg/day) given in combination, or full doses of both benazepril (20 mg/day), or valsartan&#xD;
      (320 mg/day) given alone in 102 consenting patients &gt;40 year old, with type 2 diabetes (WHO&#xD;
      criteria), serum creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dl and &lt; 3.5 mg/dl, spot morning urine albumin to&#xD;
      creatinine ratio &gt;1000mg/g for the patients without previous ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy&#xD;
      and &gt;500mg/g for the patients with previous ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy and no specific&#xD;
      contraindications to the study drugs. Primary efficacy variable will be ESRD and primary&#xD;
      comparison will be between the benazepril plus valsartan and valsartan alone groups. The&#xD;
      analysis will have an 80% power to detect (p=0.05, two-side test) a 50% difference in ESRD&#xD;
      incidence.&#xD;
