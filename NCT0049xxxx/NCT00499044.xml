      The investigators will compare the test-retest reliabilities of two cognitive batteries in&#xD;
      people with schizophrenia: Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Cognitive Assessment System&#xD;
      (&quot;CDR&quot;) and MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (&quot;MCCB&quot;). The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      there will be a statistically significant difference in the test-retest reliabilities between&#xD;
      MCCB and CDR. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that each of the two batteries will&#xD;
      better measure certain areas of cognition. The investigators also hypothesize that scores&#xD;
      from both batteries will correlate with quality of life scores, and that there will be a&#xD;
      significant difference between the correlations of MCCB and CDR. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize there will be a significant difference in patients' self-reported tolerability&#xD;
      and satisfaction of the MATRICS versus CDR assessments. Lastly, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that there will be a significant difference in the MATRICS versus CDR batteries with respect&#xD;
      to an administrator-rated score of practicality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 32 subjects will enroll in the study. Following consent and eligibility&#xD;
      screening (visit 1) and baseline clinical assessment and training in the use of the CDR&#xD;
      battery (visit 2), subjects will be randomized into one of two groups for visits 3 and 4. One&#xD;
      group will complete the CDR and then MCCB in visit 3, as well as the Tolerability Scale for&#xD;
      each battery. The other group will complete the batteries in reverse order during visit 3.&#xD;
      Each group will complete both batteries again in reverse order for visit 4. Randomization&#xD;
      will be done in blocks of 2. After completion of every 4 subjects, study administrators will&#xD;
      complete the Practicality Scale for each battery.&#xD;

      The National Institute of Mental Health's Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve&#xD;
      Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) program was a collaboration between members of academia,&#xD;
      industry, and the government, with the goal of furthering the development of drugs for the&#xD;
      treatment of the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. The program led to the creation of the&#xD;
      MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), which measures functioning across various&#xD;
      cognitive domains, such as attention, working memory (verbal and nonverbal), learning (verbal&#xD;
      and visual), reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. Its measurements are based&#xD;
      on timed paper and pencil, computerized, and orally administered tests, as well as spatial&#xD;
      tests using geometric cubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) is a United Kingdom-based company that has developed another&#xD;
      battery of assessments capable of measuring cognitive function in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Its Computerized Cognitive Assessment System consists of performance tasks&#xD;
      that measure reaction time, numeric and spatial working memory, word and picture recall and&#xD;
      recognition, and episodic secondary memory. CDR is a single, unified battery that can be&#xD;
      stored and administered using a laptop computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive assessments are important in establishing the efficacy of medications and other&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions for improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this cognitive functioning is correlated with patients' ability to operate in&#xD;
      the real world. This study aims to examine the test-retest reliabilities of the CDR and&#xD;
      MATRICS cognitive batteries, and thereby gauge their value for use in studies of cognitive&#xD;
      functioning in people with schizophrenia. The investigators hypothesize that for patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia there will be a significant difference in the test-retest reliabilities&#xD;
      between the two batteries. Additional aims are to investigate the extent to which MCCB and&#xD;
      CDR measure functioning in specific cognitive domains and to investigate patient tolerability&#xD;
      and overall practicality of each battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (1.5 hours): Baseline Measures and Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical chart to confirm DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective&#xD;
           disorder (depressed type) and medical/psychiatric stability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary drug test to exclude current use of PCP, cannabis, alcohol, cocaine,&#xD;
           amphetamine, methamphetamine, and opiates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (2 hours): Clinical Assessment and Training&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Rating Scales: Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Brief&#xD;
           Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Quality of Life Scale (QLS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDR training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4 (2.5 hours each): Patients are randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: CDR battery followed by MATRICS battery (with short break in between);&#xD;
           Tolerability Scale after each battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 (two weeks after Visit 3): MATRICS battery followed by CDR battery (with short&#xD;
           break in between); Tolerability Scale after each battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: MATRICS battery followed by CDR battery (with short break in between);&#xD;
           Tolerability Scale after each battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 (two weeks after Visit 3): CDR battery followed by MATRICS battery (with short&#xD;
           break in between); Tolerability Scale after each battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a screening visit and chart review to assure the clinical&#xD;
      appropriateness and safety of their participation. Subjects are free to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any stage without giving a reason.&#xD;
