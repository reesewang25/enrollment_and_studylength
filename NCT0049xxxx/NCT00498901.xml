      RATIONALE: Aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, prevent the formation of estradiol, a&#xD;
      female hormone. Giving letrozole together with goserelin, leuprolide, or surgery may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment in women with hormone-dependent breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving letrozole together with goserelin or&#xD;
      leuprolide works in treating premenopausal estrogen receptor-positive patients with stage IV&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure overall response rate (ORR) in premenopausal women treated with an aromatase&#xD;
           inhibitor (AI) and ovarian suppression (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure time to treatment failure (TTF) in premenopausal women treated with an AI and&#xD;
           OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure time to progression (TTP) in premenopausal women treated with an AI and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure time to death in premenopausal women treated with an AI and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) in premenopausal women treated with an AI and&#xD;
           OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of an AI and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether ORR, TTP, and CBR are similar to what is seen in postmenopausal&#xD;
           women treated with an AI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether ORR, TTP, and CBR are similar to what is seen in premenopausal&#xD;
           women treated with tamoxifen and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if levels of estrogen (i.e., estradiol or estrone) are adequately&#xD;
           suppressed in premenopausal women on an AI and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo surgical ovarian suppression (OS) or medical OS with luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (i.e., goserelin or leuprolide acetate,&#xD;
      intramuscularly once monthly for 3 months and then every 2 months thereafter for the duration&#xD;
      of study therapy). Beginning on day 14 after initiation of LHRH-agonist therapy or surgery,&#xD;
      patients receive oral letrozole once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopausal status is tested periodically during study by measuring serum estradiol levels.&#xD;
      Patients not converting to a menopausal state after the first month of study therapy, receive&#xD;
      a higher dose of LHRH and undergo repeat estradiol testing in the second month. If the&#xD;
      patient continues to be premenopausal, they are then considered for bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy or removed from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter.&#xD;
