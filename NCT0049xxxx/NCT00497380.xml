  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle catabolism is a major problem in cancer patients undergoing surgery as it negatively&#xD;
      affects post-operative recovery. Recent evidence exists that protein metabolic changes are&#xD;
      already apparent in cancer before muscle wasting is being present. In line, patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer, generally characterized by a normal nutritional status, were recently found to&#xD;
      be arginine deficient. Arginine deficiency in cancer can be explained by: 1) Reduced arginine&#xD;
      availability, due to exhaustion of endogenous (muscle) sources of arginine 2) Enhanced&#xD;
      arginine catabolism, due to conversion of arginine by arginase, which is abundant in tumors.&#xD;
      Protein is the most important endogenous source of arginine. Arginine deficiency will lead to&#xD;
      a negative feedback loop in cachexia by promoting protein breakdown in an attempt to restore&#xD;
      plasma arginine levels. We hypothesize that pre-operative arginine supplementation in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients diminishes the occurrence of muscle wasting after surgery by 1) normalizing&#xD;
      arginine availability pre-operatively, resulting in conservation of protein, 2) diminishing&#xD;
      the catabolic effects of surgery by supplying exogenous arginine for the post-operative&#xD;
      response, 3) enhancing the anabolic capacity to feeding through supplying substrate for&#xD;
      protein synthesis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the present proposal, the effects of surgery and cancer will be examined by comparing&#xD;
      subjects undergoing breast surgery because of malignancy vs. prophylactic reasons (aim 1).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the effects of one-week pre-operative protein feeding with or without enrichment&#xD;
      with arginine on post-operative protein metabolism (aim 2) will be investigated in the cancer&#xD;
      group. Variables of interest are: 1. Whole-body and skeletal muscle protein metabolism, whole&#xD;
      body arginine turnover and de-novo arginine production rate, and the anabolic capacity to&#xD;
      feeding(assessed by stable isotope methodology). 2. Body weight, muscle mass and functional&#xD;
      status, score for well-being (assessed by Profile of Mood State and Mini Mental State).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we propose that a nutritional supplement that is high in protein&#xD;
      content and enhanced in arginine will be more effective than a typical commercial nutritional&#xD;
      supplement in diminishing the catabolic effects of surgery in subjects with cancer, thereby&#xD;
      optimizing their quality of life. If this is found to be the case, this would provide the&#xD;
      basis for reformulating the nutritional composition in accord with the effects of cancer and&#xD;
      surgery on protein metabolism.&#xD;
