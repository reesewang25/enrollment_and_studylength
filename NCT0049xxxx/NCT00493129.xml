      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess the response rate of ONTAK in Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety of ONTAK in SM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the time to progression and duration of response following treatment with&#xD;
           ONTAK.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Denileukin diftitox has been used for the treatment of a variety of disorders, in particular,&#xD;
      malignant lymphoma, another blood-related disease. Denileukin diftitox is believed to be able&#xD;
      to specifically attach to and kill malignant mast cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests&quot;. These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the&#xD;
      study. You will have blood (around 2 teaspoons) and bone marrow samples collected. To collect&#xD;
      a bone marrow sample, an area of the hip bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of&#xD;
      bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. These samples will be used for tests to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis of the disease. Women who are able to have children must have a&#xD;
      negative blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible, you will receive denileukin diftitox as an injection by vein&#xD;
      once a day for 5 days in a row. This will be repeated every 3 weeks (1 cycle). You will&#xD;
      receive treatment on an outpatient basis. Treatment will continue as long as there is&#xD;
      evidence that therapy is affecting the disease and is beneficial to you. If the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off the study and&#xD;
      your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment you will have blood (around 1 teaspoon) collected twice during every 3-week&#xD;
      period. You will also have bone marrow samples collected every 3 months during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, blood and bone marrow samples will be collected every 3 months&#xD;
      until the disease gets worse or you start a different therapy. The blood and bone marrow&#xD;
      samples will be used to look at response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Denileukin diftitox has been approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of skin T-cell lymphoma and is commercially available. The use of denileukin&#xD;
      diftitox in this study is investigational. You will be provided denileukin diftitox free of&#xD;
      charge. Up to 25 participants will take part in this study. All be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
