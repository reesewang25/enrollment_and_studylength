      Autosomal-Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary renal&#xD;
      disease, characterized by the progressive development of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney&#xD;
      leading to progressive loss of renal function and eventually to renal failure. It is&#xD;
      responsible for 8% to 10% of the cases of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western&#xD;
      countries. ADPKD progression is largely dependent on the development and growth of the cysts&#xD;
      and secondary disruption of the normal tissue. Renoprotective interventions in ADPKD - in&#xD;
      addition to achieve maximal reduction of arterial blood pressure and proteinuria and to limit&#xD;
      the effects of additional potential promoters of disease progression such as dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      chronic hyperglycemia or smoking - should also be specifically aimed to correct the&#xD;
      dysregulation of epithelial cell growth, secretion, and matrix interactions characteristic of&#xD;
      the disease. Genetically in the ADPKD three different genes are implicated (PKD1 85% of the&#xD;
      cases, PKD2 15% and probably PDK3 not yet identified). PKD1 gene encodes a protein named&#xD;
      polycystin-1 (PC1). Defect in PC1 lead to aberrant activation of the enzyme mTOR in the&#xD;
      epithelial cells of the renal tubules which eventually leads to abnormal proliferation of&#xD;
      these cells and cysts generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus (Rapamycin) is an immunosuppressant mostly used for the management of kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients. This drug by very specifically and effectively inhibiting mTOR, exerts&#xD;
      antiproliferative and growth inhibiting effects and could be extremely important for the&#xD;
      inhibition of cyst progression in ADPKD. Animal models of ADPKD have shown that short-term&#xD;
      treatment with sirolimus resulted in dramatic reduction of kidney size, prevented the loss of&#xD;
      kidney function, and lowered cyst volume density. Similarly, retrospective observations from&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients have documented that sirolimus treatment reduced kidney volumes&#xD;
      by 25%, whereas there was no effect in patients not given the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these findings provide the basis for designing a prospective study in ADPKD patients&#xD;
      aimed to document the efficacy of sirolimus treatment in preventing further increase or even&#xD;
      reducing the total kidney volume and the renal volume taken up by small cysts, eventually&#xD;
      halting kidney disease progression. It is a 6 month treatment with sirolimus compared to&#xD;
      conventional therapy in adult patients with ADPKD and normal renal function or mild to&#xD;
      moderate renal insufficiency.&#xD;

      Introduction Autosomal-Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common&#xD;
      hereditary renal disease, responsible for 8% to 10% of the cases of end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) in Western countries. The disease is characterized by the progressive development of&#xD;
      fluid-filled cysts in the kidney. The renal cysts originate from the epithelia of the&#xD;
      nephrons and are lined by a single layer of cells that have a higher rate of cellular growth&#xD;
      and proliferation. At comparable levels of blood pressure control and proteinuria, patients&#xD;
      with ADPKD have faster decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than those with other&#xD;
      renal diseases and do not seem to benefit to the same extent of ACE inhibitor therapy. Thus,&#xD;
      renoprotective interventions in ADPKD - in addition to achieve maximal reduction of arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure and proteinuria and to limit the effects of additional potential promoters of&#xD;
      disease progression such as dyslipidemia, chronic hyperglycemia or smoking - should also be&#xD;
      specifically aimed to correct the dysregulation of epithelial cell growth, secretion, and&#xD;
      matrix interactions characteristic of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADPKD shows genetic heterogeneity, with at least three different genes implicated: the PKD1&#xD;
      gene (85% of the cases), the PKD2 (15% of the cases), and probably a PDK3 gene (not yet&#xD;
      identified). PKD1 gene was identified more than a decade ago, the development of treatment&#xD;
      strategies has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the function of polycystin-1&#xD;
      (PC1), the protein encoded by the PKD1 gene. However, a new function of PC1 has been recently&#xD;
      identified, which suggests a possibility for future treatment options. Indeed, it has been&#xD;
      reported that PC1 tail interacts with tuberin, the product of the TSC2 gene. The main&#xD;
      function of tuberin is to inactivate the Ser/Thr kinase mTOR which, in turn, promotes&#xD;
      phosphorylation of two proteins, S6-kinase and 4E-BP1. mTOR activity has been linked to&#xD;
      increased cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and changes in differentiation. Researchers&#xD;
      have subsequently shown that in ADPKD experimental animal models cyst lining epithelial cells&#xD;
      exhibited very high mTOR activity, and hypothesized that PC1 normally suppresses mTOR&#xD;
      activity and that defects in PC1 (and in other proteins) lead to aberrant mTOR activation. Of&#xD;
      interest, all these proteins are localized to primary cilia or renal epithelial cells or to&#xD;
      the basal bodies from which cilia emanate. This finding has led to the view that loss of&#xD;
      cilia function leads to cysts formation in the kidney. The finding that mTOR is&#xD;
      inappropriately activated in polycystic kidney disease mouse models suggests that mTOR&#xD;
      activation may be a consequence of the loss of cilia function. If mTOR is such a converging&#xD;
      point, it would be worthwhile as possible drug target for treatment of renal cystic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant mostly used for the management of kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients. This drug by very specifically and effectively inhibiting mTOR, exerts&#xD;
      antiproliferative and growth inhibiting effects that might serve preventing uncontrolled&#xD;
      tubular cell proliferation and could be extremely important for the inhibition of cyst&#xD;
      progression in APKD. Interestingly, studies in rat models of ADPKD have shown that short-term&#xD;
      treatment with sirolimus resulted in dramatic reduction of kidney size, prevented the loss of&#xD;
      kidney function, and lowered cyst volume density. Similarly, retrospective observations from&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients have documented that sirolimus treatment reduced kidney volumes&#xD;
      by 25%, whereas there was no effect in patients not given the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these findings provide the basis for designing a prospective study in ADPKD patients&#xD;
      aimed to document the efficacy of sirolimus treatment in preventing further increase or even&#xD;
      reducing the total kidney volume and the renal volume taken up by small cysts, eventually&#xD;
      halting kidney disease progression. As an additional aim of the present study, we will assess&#xD;
      the safety profile of sirolimus, when given to ADPKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The general aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 6 month treatment&#xD;
      with sirolimus (on the top of the best available therapy) as compared to conventional therapy&#xD;
      in adult patients with ADPKD and normal renal function or mild to moderate renal&#xD;
      insufficiency. In particular we will compare the change over baseline of the total kidney&#xD;
      volume volume in sirolimus and conventional treatment ADPKD groups during 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This will be a randomized, longitudinal, open, cross-over study with a baseline&#xD;
      evaluation and 6 month treatment period with sirolimus given in addition to conventional&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive therapy to appropriately control blood pressure, in ADPKD patients (n=16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus Patients will be given sirolimus starting at the oral daily dose of 3 mg, with&#xD;
      periodical whole blood level measurements. The daily dose will be adjusted to keep sirolimus&#xD;
      concentration within 10-15 ng/ml. Drug levels will be assessed at day 5 after starting&#xD;
      treatment and every two weeks for the first month; subsequently sirolimus concentrations will&#xD;
      be monitored at monthly intervals (or 5 days after drug dose adjustments) until the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Therapy There is no specific therapy for ADPKD patients. Conventional treatment&#xD;
      relates usually to the administration of antihypertensive drugs for patients with high blood&#xD;
      pressure. Thus, for the present study, no major change in antihypertensive treatment should&#xD;
      be introduced throughout the whole study period unless deemed clinically necessary (the&#xD;
      reason of the changes should be, however, clearly explained in the CRF). Only small changes&#xD;
      in the doses of the ongoing treatments are recommended in order to maintain the same level of&#xD;
      blood pressure control (target systolic/diastolic blood pressure &lt;130/80 mnHg). This approach&#xD;
      is aimed to minimize the confounding effect of any change in concomitant treatments on some&#xD;
      efficacy variables (such as urinary protein excretion rate).&#xD;
