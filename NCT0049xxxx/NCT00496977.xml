    <textblock>
      The trial is a randomised trial comparing annual CT screening for lung cancer with no&#xD;
      screening in 4104 smokers and former smokers between the age of 50 and 70 years. The goals&#xD;
      are: 1) to evaluate if annual CT screening can reduce lung cancer mortality by more than 20 %&#xD;
      (in collaboration with the NELSON trial in the Netherlands, 2) to evaluate psychological&#xD;
      effects of screening including the effects of false positive diagnoses, and 3) to evaluate&#xD;
      possible effects on smoking behaviour. The trial is funded in full by the Danish Ministry of&#xD;
      Interior and Health.&#xD;

      The trial is a parallel randomized controlled trial comparing either a yearly low dose CT&#xD;
      scan or no screening. It is scheduled to enroll 4000 smokers and former smokers, and the&#xD;
      study is scheduled to last 5 years, i.e. an initial (prevalence) screening is followed by 4&#xD;
      annual (incidence) screenings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the following investigations are done: A prospective, longitudinal questionnaire&#xD;
      assessment of enrolled participants who have received a false positive diagnosis. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will focus on the consequences of receiving a false positive diagnosis. Answers&#xD;
      from enrolled subjects who have received a false positive diagnosis will be compared to their&#xD;
      own &quot;baseline&quot; responses, and responses from subjects who have received a negative result of&#xD;
      their own low-dose CT scans All participants will annually be questioned regarding smoking&#xD;
      habits, their motivation for cessation of smoking and will be advised to refrain from smoking&#xD;
      to assess the effect of participation in a screening protocol for lung cancer on cessation of&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic consequences of screening for lung cancer will be assessed by longitudinal&#xD;
      registration of costs and benefits (e.g. morbidity, hospitalization, GP consultations etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the value of PET scanning when screening for lung cancer.&#xD;
