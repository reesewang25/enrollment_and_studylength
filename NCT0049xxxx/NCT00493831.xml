  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, open-label, clinical trial is to establish the feasibility&#xD;
      and validity of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) biomarkers for use in studies designed to&#xD;
      evaluate harm reduction strategies of smoking. This will be accomplished by measuring&#xD;
      selected markers in EBC believed related to the pathogenesis of lung disease before and after&#xD;
      a smoking cessation intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty subjects will be accrued in three groups based on smoking habit: 10-20, 20-30 and &gt;30&#xD;
      cigarettes/day. Eligibility criteria include male and female cigarette smokers â‰¥19 years of&#xD;
      age, who are able to give informed consent, able to exhale into Eco Screen instrument for&#xD;
      15-20 minutes. All must be willing to make a serious quit attempt and be willing to use&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded if any of the following are present: regular use of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication; presence of any inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract&#xD;
      including moderate or worse COPD (FEV1 &lt; 80% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.7). Subjects&#xD;
      with normal lung function who meet criteria for diagnosis of chronic bronchitis will be&#xD;
      excluded. Subjects with stable medical conditions, excluding inflammatory lung disease, will&#xD;
      be permitted to participate, providing anti-inflammatory therapies are not used regularly and&#xD;
      providing there has been no change in their clinical status in the two months prior to&#xD;
      beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering into the study, subjects will establish a quit date and will be treated with&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products based on individual preference and will receive&#xD;
      smoking cessation counseling. They will then be seen at 12 visits over the course of 25&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations will include vital signs, interval smoking history, food frequency questionnaire,&#xD;
      exhaled carbon monoxide, blood drawn for chemistry and CBC, peripheral blood harvested and&#xD;
      serum aliquoted and saved for future biochemical analysis, urine sample for isoprostane,&#xD;
      pregnancy test for females, and exhaled breath condensate. Some visits may also include&#xD;
      spirometry with and with out bronchodilators, 24 hour urine collections for NNAL and NNAL-glc&#xD;
      quantification, health status assessed using St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue, the Leicester Cough&#xD;
      Questionnaire, the Clinical COPD Questionnaire and smoking related symptoms assessed using&#xD;
      the Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale.&#xD;
