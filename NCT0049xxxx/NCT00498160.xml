  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to establish chimerism and avoid graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      in patients with kidney failure allowing a reduction or cessation of immune-suppressive&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the present time, kidney transplant recipients must take anti-rejection medication to&#xD;
      prevent rejection of the donated kidney. Even with this medication, chronic rejection is the&#xD;
      most common cause of late graft loss. The anti-rejection agents themselves are significantly&#xD;
      toxic, with side effects including kidney damage, infection and an increased incidence of&#xD;
      cancer. The goal of this study is to allow the patient to develop &quot;tolerance&quot; to the&#xD;
      transplanted kidney while maintaining a competent immune system. Tolerance enables the&#xD;
      transplant recipient's body to recognize the transplanted organ as self rather than foreign&#xD;
      tissue. The recipient will not try to reject the donor kidney and the need for anti-rejection&#xD;
      medication could be dramatically decreased or eliminated entirely. To accomplish this,&#xD;
      patients in this study will receive specially treated bone marrow taken from their kidney&#xD;
      donor. Bone marrow transplant has been shown in animal studies and in humans to induce&#xD;
      tolerance following organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two factors limit the application of donor marrow transplant to induce tolerance: 1)&#xD;
      preparing the patient for transplant (conditioning); and 2) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
      Traditional conditioning destroys the recipient's immune system and requires that the marrow&#xD;
      transplant be successful because the patient is unable to fight off infection if the donor&#xD;
      cells do not survive. GVHD occurs when donor immune cells recognize the recipient's cells as&#xD;
      foreign tissue and attack them. Severe GVHD can result in death. This study utilizes a new&#xD;
      approach to conditioning which leaves the patient's immune system intact. The transplant&#xD;
      product is depleted of GVHD-producing cells but retains tolerance-promoting facilitating&#xD;
      cells, which are intended to ensure the donor and recipient cells coexists peacefully, a&#xD;
      state called mixed chimerism. The toxicity of conditioning and transplantation is&#xD;
      significantly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will determine the appropriate cell dose to safely establish mixed&#xD;
      chimerism following partial conditioning in living donor or deceased donor kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients. The study takes a gradual approach to increasing the cell dose to achieve mixed&#xD;
      chimerism. We believe this study will provide a breakthrough in the approach to kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. Our goal is to evaluate the potential of safely establishing mixed chimerism&#xD;
      to induce tolerance following kidney transplant and reduce or eliminate the need for&#xD;
      anti-rejection therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be between the ages of 18 and 65 years and meet the institution's&#xD;
             criteria for renal transplantation for end-organ failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is receiving first renal transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is receiving a renal transplant only&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The crossmatch is negative between donor and recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine&#xD;
             test is acceptable) within 48 hours of initiating total body irradiation (TBI) and&#xD;
             agree to use reliable contraception for 1 year following transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The subjects do not need to be local residents in order to be eligible for this&#xD;
        trial, but must be willing to reside in the area, or within a four hour drive, for the&#xD;
        first three months of the protocol so that we can monitor them closely in the early post&#xD;
        transplant period. As long as there is insurance or funding that will cover the cost of the&#xD;
        transplant and any research related complications, it is not necessary for the subjects to&#xD;
        be US citizens to participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically active bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or serologic evidence of viral infection which would preclude the recipient&#xD;
             from receiving a kidney transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation therapy at a dose which would preclude TBI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive crossmatch between donor and recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence for immunologic memory against donor&#xD;
&#xD;
