      The objective of this randomized control trial is to compare the effectiveness of Stress&#xD;
      Inoculation Training (SIT), a well researched psychological treatment for Post Traumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorder (PTSD), to that of the non-specific standard care provided in primary care&#xD;
      settings, called Supportive Counseling (SC), on individuals who were exposed to the September&#xD;
      11, 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, or the immediate aftermath of this attack. Both&#xD;
      SIT and SC interventions will each be provided in one 2-hour session with eight weeks of&#xD;
      daily systematic web-based follow up to promote self-help. The primary hypothesis of this&#xD;
      study is that SIT will reduce the level of PTSD in participants relative to SCand to the&#xD;
      pre-treatment levels.&#xD;

      Because resources are often scarce in the aftermath of disasters, a useful mental health&#xD;
      intervention is one that is effective, feasible, rapidly available, and efficiently delivered&#xD;
      to the largest proportion of affected individuals possible. In terms of treating PTSD in&#xD;
      other trauma contexts, there is considerable evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      procedures are effective at reducing the array of PTSD symptoms. Overall, the available&#xD;
      evidence points to the theoretical and empirical justification for using Prolonged Exposure&#xD;
      (PE) and Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), two components of CBT, with patients presenting&#xD;
      with PTSD. A practical limitation of available studies is that they are limited to&#xD;
      individually administered therapy contexts that typically require between 8 and 12 sessions&#xD;
      delivered in a specialty mental health care-setting. The labor-intensive nature of these&#xD;
      therapies represents a significant obstacle to provision of therapy to potentially thousands&#xD;
      of individuals suffering PTSD in the context of mass violence events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aim of this project is to evaluate an abbreviated format of SIT that aims to&#xD;
      provide effective self/stress-management skills to individuals with PTSD. The rationale&#xD;
      behind this intervention is that with appropriate and intensive therapist input during a&#xD;
      single session of therapy, supplemented systematically with self-paced and self-directed&#xD;
      homework, promoted, prompted, and monitored via a specialized web-site and augmented by&#xD;
      therapist feedback and guidance delivered via the web, primary care patients with PTSD&#xD;
      stemming from mass violence can benefit from the strategies that have demonstrated efficacy&#xD;
      in reducing PTSD symptoms. Survivors of the Pentagon attack on 9/11 who present at primary&#xD;
      care clinics that serve the Pengaton are randomly assigned to SIT or a supportive counseling&#xD;
      control group. Patients' compliance and symptoms are monitored on the web and via clinical&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
