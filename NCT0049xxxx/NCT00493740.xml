    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to examine the cephalic phase insulin response (CPIR) and&#xD;
      pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release as indicators of the cephalic phase occurrence and&#xD;
      magnitude to palatable food stimulus (chocolate cake) in oncology patients before and after&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment as compared to healthy controls . This may enlighten our understanding&#xD;
      of the etiology of taste dysfunction and anorexia during chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food stimulation of gastric and pancreatic secretion is classically divided into cephalic,&#xD;
      gastric and intestinal phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cephalic phase refers to a simultaneous activation of gastrointestinal motility, gastric acid&#xD;
      and pancreatic enzyme secretion ,as well as, release of hormones from the endocrine pancreas&#xD;
      which occurs through activation of vagal -efferents as a result of food-related sensory&#xD;
      stimuli such as taste and smell prior to nutrient absorption and which coincides with a&#xD;
      thermogenic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the cephalic phase secretions, cephalic phase insulin release (CPIR) has received the most&#xD;
      attention, but pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and glucagon responses have also been studied.&#xD;
      While the magnitude of cephalic phase insulin release is relatively small (25% above&#xD;
      baseline), pancreatic polypeptide increases 100% above baseline. The large magnitude of the&#xD;
      PP response makes it a sensitive indicator of vagal activation to food stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most experiments, subjects are either exposed to visual and olfactory stimulation by&#xD;
      seeing and smelling the food stimulus or are required to perform a modified sham-feed, i.e.&#xD;
      to taste, chew and then expectorate the food stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, cephalic phase are thought to be preparatory responses before ingestion of food.&#xD;
      Because of their small magnitude, the physiological significance of the cephalic phase&#xD;
      hormonal responses has been largely discounted. However, there is evidence that experimental&#xD;
      prevention of CPIR lead to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Therefore, CPIR may contribute&#xD;
      to glucose homeostasis /regulation. Moreover CPIR may be an indicator of hunger and could be&#xD;
      important for understanding eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with these hormonal secretion ,an increase in energy expenditure has been also&#xD;
      observed .This thermogenic response to food is even greater with sham feeding than with&#xD;
      normal feeding and is paralleled by changes in RQ showing enhanced carbohydrate oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disorders of taste are prevalent symptom in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The literature&#xD;
      suggests that 36% to71% of patients report a distressing change in taste which often have a&#xD;
      negative impact on quality of life and nutrition. It is unknown whether the cephalic phase of&#xD;
      oncology patients may also be disturbed.&#xD;
