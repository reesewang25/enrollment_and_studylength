      The middle ear is an airspace located behind the eardrum that consists of two connecting&#xD;
      compartments. The compartment directly behind the eardrum is called the tympanum and contains&#xD;
      the three small bones of the middle ear, the hammer, anvil and stapes, that function to&#xD;
      transfer eardrum movements to the inner ear so that you can hear. Behind the tympanum is the&#xD;
      mastoid cavity which is a larger airspace subdivided into small air cells of unknown&#xD;
      function. For normal hearing, it is important that the air pressure in the middle ear is&#xD;
      similar to that of the environment so that the eardrum can move freely in response to sounds.&#xD;
      The air pressure of the environment is not constant and is affected by changes in weather&#xD;
      conditions (high and low pressure systems that move through the area) and by changes in&#xD;
      elevation above sea level (the fullness in your ears that can be noticed when you ride in an&#xD;
      elevator or in an airplane). The air pressure in the middle ear also changes because middle&#xD;
      ear gas is constantly leaking from that airspace to the blood that flows through the walls of&#xD;
      the middle ear. These effects (changing environmental air pressures and changing middle ear&#xD;
      air pressure) are independent and cause the middle ear and environmental pressures to be&#xD;
      different from each other. Periodically and during swallowing or yawning, any existing&#xD;
      difference between middle ear and environmental air pressure is reset to zero by the opening&#xD;
      of a biological tube (the Eustachian tube) that connects the middle ear to the back of the&#xD;
      nose. This allows gas flow between the middle ear and the environment which increases or&#xD;
      decreases middle ear pressure to the level in the environment at that time. Most people&#xD;
      cannot open their Eustachian tubes at will and the number of automatic openings varies from&#xD;
      infrequent to often in a population. Whether or not a person's usual frequency of Eustachian&#xD;
      openings is good enough to keep the middle ear pressure the same as environmental levels&#xD;
      depends on how fast gas is lost from the middle ear by gas leakage (diffusion) to blood. For&#xD;
      example, in ears with very slow rates of gas loss, the Eustachian tube does not need to open&#xD;
      very frequently to keep the middle ear at environmental pressure. Some researchers believe&#xD;
      that the mastoid compartment functions to control the rate of gas loss to blood, with larger&#xD;
      mastoid volumes associated with lesser rates of middle ear gas loss. In this experiment, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to test this by measuring mastoid and tympanum volumes using Computer&#xD;
      tomography (CT) and the rate of blood to middle ear gas transfer using a technique that&#xD;
      involves breathing air that contains laughing gas (Nitrous Oxide=N2O) and measuring middle&#xD;
      ear pressure change using tympanometry (a technique that involves putting an ear plug into&#xD;
      the ear canal and measuring the pressure). From past studies in patients undergoing short&#xD;
      surgical or dental procedures, the investigators know that breathing gas mixtures that&#xD;
      contain N2O will increase the blood levels of that gas, cause gas to go from blood to the&#xD;
      middle ear and increase middle ear pressure. The investigators predict that the rate of&#xD;
      change in middle ear pressure while breathing a gas mixture containing 25% N2O and the normal&#xD;
      oxygen level (20%) of air will be less for those ears with larger mastoid volumes. If the&#xD;
      investigators prediction is correct, they will be able to explain why ears with larger&#xD;
      mastoid volumes are better able to keep their pressure like that of the environment even if&#xD;
      the Eustachian tube does not open often.&#xD;

      The middle ear (ME) pressure balance is an important contributor to the maintenance of ME&#xD;
      health. ME pressure is a measure of the number of contained gas moles and processes that add&#xD;
      or remove gas moles from the relatively fixed volume ME cavity change its pressure. Three&#xD;
      routes for ME gas exchange have been identified; 1) passive, gradient-dependent species&#xD;
      exchange with the local blood via diffusion across the ME mucosa; 2) passive,&#xD;
      gradient-dependent species exchange with the ambient environment via diffusion across the&#xD;
      tympanic membrane, and 3) bolus exchange of mixed gases between the nasopharynx and ME during&#xD;
      transient openings of the Eustachian tube. Total ME pressure and the trajectory of ME&#xD;
      pressure under specified conditions depend on the relative rates of species gas exchanges&#xD;
      across these pathways. The ME airspace can be subdivided into two compartments, the anterior&#xD;
      tympanum and the posterior mastoid air cell system (MACS). Theory suggests that the&#xD;
      transmucosal gas exchange rate for the ME (transMEM) may be different for the tympanum and&#xD;
      the MACS and this possibility has important implications with respect to the role of the MACS&#xD;
      in ME pressure regulation and protection from ME disease. This study measures the rate of&#xD;
      inert gas exchange across the mucosa of the two ME compartments in adults. These data will be&#xD;
      fitted to a model of gas exchange parameterized based on the relative surface areas and&#xD;
      volumes of the two compartments, and the hypothesis that volume gas exchange across the MACS&#xD;
      mucosa is less than that for the tympanum will be tested. The results will be used to reject&#xD;
      or confirm one mechanism by which large MACS volume protects from otitis media under certain&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
