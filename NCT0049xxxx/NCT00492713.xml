      Dark chocolate is one of the richest sources of polyphenols though it has been hypothesised&#xD;
      that the bioavailability of epicatechin from milk chocolate was reduced compared to dark. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure is to compare plasma polyphenol levels after consumption of 3&#xD;
      chocolates (2 milk, 1 dark) while the secondary outcome measures are to characterise the time&#xD;
      course of polyphenols in the blood and to investigate individual variation in Tmax and Cmax&#xD;
      for use in future studies.&#xD;

      Dark chocolate is one of the richest sources of polyphenols, for example, a standard 40g&#xD;
      portion of dark chocolate contains 400-800 mg of polyphenols, compared to red wine (170 mg&#xD;
      /100ml) or an apple (200 mg/piece). Cocoa polyphenols, most notably the catechins, can exist&#xD;
      in both lipid and water-based environments (amphipathic), meaning they can spare both&#xD;
      lipophillic and hydrophilic vitamins. There have been a number of human trials conducted&#xD;
      using chocolate or cocoa and measuring various endpoints. Most have been conducted with dark&#xD;
      chocolate. An article in Nature found that the bioavailability of epicatechin from milk&#xD;
      chocolate was substantially reduced compared to dark, and even dark taken with a glass of&#xD;
      milk (Serafini et al 2003). The hypothesis was that the milk proteins bind to polyphenols,&#xD;
      making them unavailable. Subsequent studies have not been able to reproduce this, but none&#xD;
      have been conducted using solid chocolate as the first study, all have been done using a&#xD;
      drink matrix, which may completely alter the binding interactions of the polyphenols and&#xD;
      protein. Previous bioavailability trials with dark chocolate have shown a 12 fold increase in&#xD;
      plasma epicatechin 2 hours after consumption of 80g of chocolate containing 557 mg total&#xD;
      polyphenols (137 mg epicatechin) (Rein et al 2000) with a concurrent increase in plasma total&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity and a decrease in TBARS. Another study showed an increase in epicatechin&#xD;
      2 hours after administering 25g of chocolate chips containing 220 mg flavanols and&#xD;
      procyanidins, with a concurrent increase in prostacyclin/leukotriene ratio and reduction in&#xD;
      platelet-related hemostasis (Holt et al 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a blinded, three arm crossover trial. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is to compare plasma polyphenol levels after consumption of 3 chocolates (2 milk, 1 dark)&#xD;
      while the secondary outcome measures are to characterise the time course of polyphenols in&#xD;
      the blood and to investigate individual variation in Tmax and Cmax for use in future studies.&#xD;
      All volunteers will try all chocolate types with a similar taste &amp; appearance (though milk&#xD;
      and dark are likely to still be distinguishable for the volunteer, not the investigator).&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo medical screening, anthropometry, physical activity and dietary&#xD;
      assessments before randomisation for the order of consumption. Bloods are to be taken as a&#xD;
      time course for the next 24 hours, as is urine.&#xD;
