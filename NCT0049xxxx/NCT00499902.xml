  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a safe and effective bolus dose of&#xD;
      intra-arterial/intra-thrombus alfimeprase in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) 3 to 9 hours from&#xD;
      symptom onset.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently approved drug therapy for AIS is limited by the need to treat within 3 hours of&#xD;
      symptom onset. Alfimeprase acts to degrade fibrin directly and is inactivated locally by&#xD;
      circulating alpha-2 macroglobulin. This study will determine whether treatment with&#xD;
      alfimeprase facilitates rapid restoration of arterial blood flow with avoidance of&#xD;
      symptomatic hemorrhagic conversion in subjects with AIS within 3 to 9 hours of symptom onset.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    CO Phase 2 data did not show sufficient improvement in cath opening at higher&#xD;
    dose/concentration evaluated. Nuvelo ended further clinical dev of alfimeprase.&#xD;
