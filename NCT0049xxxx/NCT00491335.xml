      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of lung cancer is quite high among people with the human immunodeficiency (HIV)&#xD;
      virus. Frequent smoking may explain that cancer increase, given that 50% to 70% of&#xD;
      HIV-infected people are current smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research suggests that other factors may be involved as well. Smoking habits, such as&#xD;
      smoking earlier in life or smoking more cigarettes a day than others do, may have a role.&#xD;
      Also, HIV-infected smokers seem to have a greater risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD). The association of HIV and COPD is important, because COPD itself is linked&#xD;
      to an increased risk of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1,600 subjects from the study known as ALIVE (AIDS Linked to the Intra-Venous&#xD;
      Experience), which began in 1988 in Baltimore, Maryland, will be given a detailed&#xD;
      questionnaire on smoking behaviors and lung cancer risk factors. They will also have&#xD;
      spirometry testing, to evaluate lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better characterize smoking habits and compare tobacco use among HIV-infected and&#xD;
      uninfected drug users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare serum cotinine levels and spirometry results, as a marker of tobacco use and a&#xD;
      marker of damage to lung function, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who are in the ALIVE cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing a questionnaire on smoking history. Questions include age when smoking began,&#xD;
           periods of quitting smoking, average number of cigarettes per day for specific periods,&#xD;
           amount of each cigarette smoked, depth of inhalation, type of cigarette, nicotine&#xD;
           dependence, use of other smoked [Note: I would not mention that these drugs are illegal]&#xD;
           drugs, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, past medical history, and recent&#xD;
           respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry testing. Patients are asked to breathe as deeply as possible and then rapidly&#xD;
           exhale into a tube. The forced expiration volume in 1 second reflects the average flow&#xD;
           rate during the first second, and it can be used to determine the degree of pulmonary&#xD;
           obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples. Tests measure levels of cotinine, a chemical made by the body from&#xD;
           nicotine. African American males, who constitute the majority of the ALIVE cohort,&#xD;
           participate in this test. Results would show how much tobacco smoke has recently entered&#xD;
           the body. For this test, researchers plan to evaluate 240 current tobacco smokers and&#xD;
           100 participants who report no recent cigarette use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer incidence is substantially elevated among people infected with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although frequent smoking may partly explain this increase,&#xD;
      recent work suggests other factors may also be involved. To better characterize smoking&#xD;
      habits and lung cancer risk in HIV-infected people, the investigators propose a&#xD;
      cross-sectional pilot study of HIV-infected and uninfected injection drug users in the ALIVE&#xD;
      cohort in Baltimore, Maryland. A detailed questionnaire on smoking behaviors and other lung&#xD;
      cancer risk factors will be administered to all ~ 1600 cohort subjects. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will measure serum cotinine (a marker of recent smoking intensity) for a sample&#xD;
      of 340 African American males from the cohort, stratified on the amount of cigarette use, HIV&#xD;
      status, and CD4 count. Spirometry will be performed on the entire group of 1600 subjects, to&#xD;
      assess for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Differences between HIV-infected and&#xD;
      uninfected subjects in smoking habits, exposure to tobacco, or lung damage will identify&#xD;
      areas for future investigation.&#xD;
