  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label study to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerance of FCRx cell therapy in&#xD;
      adult recipients within 12 months after kidney transplantation from a living donor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research study which involves the use of a combination of an Enriched Hematopoietic Stem Cell&#xD;
      Infusion (stem cells, produced by the bone marrow, generate the cells that form the blood&#xD;
      elements, help fight infection and assist in clotting) and kidney transplantation from the&#xD;
      same donor to try to avoid the need for long-term anti-rejection drug therapy. The desired&#xD;
      result of this study is to allow the body to develop &quot;tolerance&quot; to the transplanted kidney.&#xD;
      Tolerance means that the body would see the transplanted kidney as part of the patient and&#xD;
      not try to get rid of, or reject it. To prevent rejection, drugs called immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agents must be taken on a daily basis. The purpose of this study is to determine if this&#xD;
      procedure is safe and to try to substantially reduce or even eliminate the need for&#xD;
      anti-rejection medications.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be between the ages of 18 and 65 years and meet the institution's&#xD;
             criteria for renal transplantation for end-organ failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meets the transplant criteria by the study site and both the recipient and donor have&#xD;
             been accepted as candidates for standard of care living kidney donation and&#xD;
             transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is receiving a renal transplant only&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The crossmatch is negative between donor and recipient. An initial crossmatch will be&#xD;
             performed prior to stem cell mobilization to determine if subject can proceed with the&#xD;
             apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential recipients who are women of child bearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test (urine test is acceptable) within 48 hours prior to receiving&#xD;
             Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and agree to use reliable contraception&#xD;
             for 1 year following FCRx infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential donors who are women of child bearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test (urine test is acceptable) within 48 hours prior to receiving G-CSF&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of donor-specific antibody presently or historically&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) less than or equal to 20&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The subjects do not need to be local residents in order to be eligible for this&#xD;
        trial, but must be willing to reside in the area, or within a four-hour drive, for the&#xD;
        first month of the protocol so that they can be monitored closely in the early&#xD;
        post-transplant period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically active bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or serologic evidence of viral infection which would preclude the recipient&#xD;
             from receiving a kidney transplant or FCRx infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation therapy at a dose which would preclude Total Body Irradiation (TBI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive crossmatch between donor and recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence for immunologic memory against donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;35 or &lt;18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serologies for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
