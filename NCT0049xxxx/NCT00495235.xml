      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if there is a link between insulin&#xD;
      resistance (or pre-diabetes) and endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the association between insulin resistance and endometrial cancer in women in&#xD;
      Harris County, Texas. 2. To assess the effect of body mass index (BMI) on the association&#xD;
      between insulin resistance and endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the association between polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and endometrial&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the relationship between known reproductive risk factors, menstrual risk&#xD;
           factors, family history and endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the molecular changes associated with insulin resistance and PCOS on normal&#xD;
           endometrium and tumor tissue.&#xD;

      This study will be comparing women who have had endometrial cancer (cases) to women who have&#xD;
      not had endometrial cancer (controls) in Harris County, Texas to better understand the risk&#xD;
      factors for getting endometrial cancer. Insulin resistance is a condition of pre-diabetes.&#xD;
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition associated with irregular periods, obesity,&#xD;
      infertility, and/or difficulty in getting pregnant. Both insulin resistance and PCOS are&#xD;
      believed to increase a woman's risk of getting endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that asks about your&#xD;
      medical history, weight history, family history, reproductive history, and birth&#xD;
      control/hormone use. The questionnaire should take about 20 minutes to complete, and you will&#xD;
      need to complete it only once. You will have your height and weight measured, and about 4&#xD;
      teaspoons of blood will be drawn to test for insulin resistance (or pre-diabetes). You will&#xD;
      be required to fast, not eat or drink anything except water, for 8 hours before having this&#xD;
      blood sample drawn. If you are premenopausal and still have both your ovaries, you will have&#xD;
      an additional 4 teaspoons of blood drawn to test for PCOS. You will complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire during your first visit or at home and will bring it back with you when you&#xD;
      come back for your fasting blood test appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have been diagnosed with endometrial cancer and have had surgery to remove your&#xD;
      uterus, you will also be asked to give permission to use a piece of your leftover tumor and&#xD;
      surrounding normal tissue to test for markers of insulin resistance and PCOS. This will be&#xD;
      from tissue that was removed during your surgery and will not require another biopsy or&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not be required to come back for any follow-up as part of this study. However, you&#xD;
      will be asked to fill out a form that asks if you would be willing to be called in the future&#xD;
      to participate in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. A total of 700 women will take part in this multicenter&#xD;
      study, 350 women with endometrial cancer and 350 women without endometrial cancer. A total of&#xD;
      up to 350 women will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.&#xD;
