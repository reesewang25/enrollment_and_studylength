  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate E7107 in patients with solid tumors. This is an&#xD;
      open label, dose-escalation study of E7107. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the single&#xD;
      agent will be established by determining the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities during&#xD;
      the first three weeks of therapy (Cycle 1). Patients in this study will be treated at&#xD;
      multiple dose levels, starting at 0.6 mg/m^2. Patients will receive E7107 as a 30-minute&#xD;
      intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 every 21 Days.&#xD;

    <description>E7107 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a starting dose of 0.6 mg/m^2 to the first cohort of patients. The same dose will be given on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Dose escalation will not occur until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. The selection of subsequent dose levels will be performed according to an accelerated design.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Surgery and radiotherapy must have been completed at least four weeks prior to study&#xD;
             entry, and prior chemotherapy and other anti-cancer therapy, excluding bisphosphonates&#xD;
             at a steady dose level, must have been discontinued 2 to 3 weeks previously. All acute&#xD;
             toxicities related to these treatments must have resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Aged ≥ 18 years&#xD;

          5. Written informed consent prior to any study specific screening procedures, which will&#xD;
             include mandatory consent to provide a blood sample specifically for pharmacogenomic&#xD;
             analysis, with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time&#xD;
             without prejudice. Tumor biopsy for pharmacogenomic (PG) analysis will be voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Anticipated life expectancy &gt; three months.&#xD;
