      The study's primary goal is to assess the safety of the SAF (Self Adjusting File) device for&#xD;
      root canal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's secondary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the SAF device for root canal&#xD;
      treatments&#xD;

      Endodontic treatment (root canal treatment) is conducted when the dental pulp is inflamed or&#xD;
      when it becomes necrotic and infected. The main cause for both these cases is dental caries&#xD;
      and they represent sequential stages of the same disease with inflammation preceding the&#xD;
      necrosis and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanically, both conditions are treated in a rather similar manner, by &quot;cleaning and&#xD;
      shaping&quot;, using endodontic files and irrigation solutions. This mechanical process is aimed&#xD;
      to thoroughly disinfect the root canal by removing all tissue remnants while enlarging the&#xD;
      diameter of the root canal, to remove all canal irregularities that may harbor bacteria.&#xD;
      During this process an inner layer of dentin has to be removed from all the surface of the&#xD;
      root canal. A second goal of root canal treatment is to allow adequate sealing of the canal&#xD;
      space by a root canal filling, in order to prevent future bacterial contamination. For teeth&#xD;
      with inflamed vital pulps, once this stage is completed the root canal may be sealed. When&#xD;
      necrotic infected root canals are involved, this stage greatly reduces the bacterial load in&#xD;
      the canal but an additional stage of disinfection by medicaments, sealed in the canal until&#xD;
      the next appointment, may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAF file is an endodontic file designed to be operated by a Profin dental low-speed&#xD;
      hand-piece (W&amp;H, Burmoos / Salzburg, Austria), which converts rotation into a transline&#xD;
      reciprocal movement. The active part of the file is manufactured from a thin-walled tube of&#xD;
      medical grade nickel-titanium alloy. It has a cylindrical shape and can be compressed to&#xD;
      allow its insertion into thin root canal, due to its lattice-like structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAF file is an endodontic file of a revolutionary design. As any endodontic file it is&#xD;
      designed to remove dentin from the root canal walls and enlarge the canal. Its advantages&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it grinds the inner root canal wall, rather than machine-cut it,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it adapts itself to the cross section of the canal and enlarges it to a wider version of&#xD;
           its original form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It enlarges the canal; using one instrument which gradually expands in size, rather than&#xD;
           tediously using a sequence of instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Its hollow space allows for continuous irrigation and flushing out the ground material&#xD;
           rather than tediously stopping again and again to remove the instrument from the root&#xD;
           canal and flush it, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it is highly resistant to breakage&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tested device is an engine-operated endodontic file used for root canal treatment. It is&#xD;
      constructed from a medical grade nickel-titanium alloy and designed as a hollow tube made of&#xD;
      a delicate metal lattice, attached to a dental hand-piece. It is operated in root canals with&#xD;
      a continuous rinsing. The rinsing solution enters the hollow device through a special&#xD;
      irrigator attachment, flows through the root canal and emerges through the access cavity,&#xD;
      where it is collected using a dental suction tip.&#xD;
