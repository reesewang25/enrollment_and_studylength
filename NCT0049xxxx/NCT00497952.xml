    <textblock>
      While the cause of MS in not known, there is an autoimmune component that destroys nerve&#xD;
      cells. Autoimmunity is a condition where an individual's immune system attacks his/her own&#xD;
      cells. Bone marrow stem cell transplantation has been shown to halt autoimmunity. Stem cell&#xD;
      transplant can be performed using the patient's own cells, or donor cells. The general&#xD;
      consensus in the field is that donor transplant is most likely to halt disease progression.&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of a donor transplant procedure as a therapy&#xD;
      for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two factors limit the widespread application of traditional donor stem cell transplant: 1)&#xD;
      preparing the patient for transplant (conditioning); and 2) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
      Traditional conditioning destroys the recipient's immune system and requires that the marrow&#xD;
      transplant be successful because the patient is unable to fight off infection if the donor&#xD;
      cells do not survive. GVHD occurs when donor immune cells recognize the recipient's cells as&#xD;
      foreign tissue and attack them. Severe GVHD can result in death. This study utilizes a new&#xD;
      approach to conditioning which leaves the patient's immune system intact. The transplant&#xD;
      product is depleted of GVHD-producing cells but retains tolerance-promoting cells, called&#xD;
      facilitating cells, which are intended to ensure the donor and recipient cells coexists&#xD;
      peacefully. The toxicity of conditioning and transplantation is significantly reduced. The&#xD;
      end result is a marrow system that contains recipient and donor cells, a state called mixed&#xD;
      chimerism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will determine the appropriate cell dose to safely establish mixed&#xD;
      chimerism following partial conditioning in patients with RRMS. The study takes a gradual&#xD;
      approach to increasing the cell dose to achieve mixed chimerism. Each patient will receive a&#xD;
      cell dose one unit above the dose received by the most recent safely transplanted patient. We&#xD;
      believe this study will provide a breakthrough in the treatment of MS. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the potential of safely establishing mixed chimerism to interrupt the&#xD;
      autoimmune process and end the devastating effects of MS.&#xD;
