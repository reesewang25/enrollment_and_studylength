      Specific Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify specific SNPs of HIF-1 gene related to cardiovascular disease in OSA&#xD;
           patients (CVD-OSA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assay the functional activity of high risk SNPs of HIF-1 on the transcription of VEGF&#xD;
           gene&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To confirm that the serum level of VEGF in CVD-OSA patients with high risk SNPs of HIF-1&#xD;
           are higher than CVD-OSA patients without&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome(OSAS) is characterized with recurrent collapse of upper&#xD;
      airway during sleep and results in hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. The repeated episodes of&#xD;
      hypoxia and sympathetic hyperactivity result in cardiovascular complications, including&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease and heart failure. Our data showed&#xD;
      among 309 consecutively-admitted OSA patients, 54% patients had cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypoxia in OSA is characterized as chronic and intermittent, which leads to sophisticated&#xD;
      adaptive mechanisms, like activations of transcriptional factors and critical signaling&#xD;
      pathways. HIF-1 is a central component of transcriptional factors involved in hypoxia-induced&#xD;
      transcription of specific genes. There are two subunits of HIF-1 transcription factor, which&#xD;
      interact with the consensus hypoxia response element in the target genes. The HIF-1 alpha&#xD;
      activity is regulated by proline hydroxylation modification and ubiquitination, which is&#xD;
      oxygen-tension dependent. HIF-1 alpha target genes encode proteins that increase oxygen&#xD;
      delivery, such as vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF). Our oligo-microarray study showed&#xD;
      both HIF and VEGF expression in OSA patients was 1.3 times of control group, which decreased&#xD;
      to 46% and 57% respectively after one-month CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIF-1 alpha polymorphism could result in increased HIF-1 alpha activity and microvessel&#xD;
      density. In clinical observation, HIF-1 polymorphism has been reported to be associated with&#xD;
      high altitude adaptation, formation of coronary collaterals in CAD and phenotype of cancer.&#xD;
      These findings were possibly explained with effect of HIF on modulation of VEGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several genetic polymorphisms were reported to be associated with OSA, which included TNF&#xD;
      alpha, angiotensin converting enzyme and haptoglobin. Only hepatoglobin phenotype is proved&#xD;
      to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in OSA. In most studies, the patient number is&#xD;
      less than suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that HIF-1 gene polymorphism was associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in OSA. And by using large-scale of study population(1000 OSA&#xD;
      patients), we examined all regions of the HIF-1 alpha to detect single-nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms(SNPs), evaluated the pattern of linkage disequilibrium to compose haplotypes in&#xD;
      the gene, and performed association studies in OSA patients with and without cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease to achieve the following 3 objectives:(1)To identify specific SNPs of HIF-1 alpha&#xD;
      gene related to cardiovascular disease in OSA patients (CVD-OSA).(2)To assay the functional&#xD;
      activity of high risk SNPs of HIF-1 alpha on the transcription of VEGF gene.(3)To confirm&#xD;
      that the serum level of VEGF in CVD-OSA patients with high risk SNPs of HIF-1 are higher than&#xD;
      CVD-OSA patients without. The findings are expected to stratify the risk of OSA patients to&#xD;
      specific outcome, or response to specific therapy.&#xD;
