      This study will examine how the areas in the brain are connected when they are controlling&#xD;
      two finger movements at the same time. It will look at how people use what they see to help&#xD;
      guide two different movements. This ability, which is important in everyday life, can be a&#xD;
      problem for patients with neurological problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy right-handed volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images&#xD;
      of body organs and tissues. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong&#xD;
      magnetic field. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner, wearing&#xD;
      earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur during the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo functional MRI (fMRI). This is a standard MRI that is done while the&#xD;
      subject performs skilled finger tasks in response to instructions they see on a screen.&#xD;
      Researchers localize brain areas which show activity changes while the tasks are performed.&#xD;
      Before the test session begins, subjects complete a questionnaire and have an opportunity to&#xD;
      practice the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects control the position of one or two cursors on a screen using one or two fingers.&#xD;
      They perform tracking or pointing tasks according to what they see on the screen. During the&#xD;
      single-task experiment only one task is presented on the screen. During the dual-task&#xD;
      experiment, two tasks are presented on the screen. Subjects perform either the single-task or&#xD;
      dual-task experiment, but not both. The fMRI lasts about 90 minutes, with subjects asked to&#xD;
      lie still during the scan for up to 9 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the fMRI, subjects are scheduled for a research electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
      and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). The test is done while the subject performs tasks so that&#xD;
      researchers can learn about the timing of changes in activity in certain brain regions during&#xD;
      performance of the same tasks done for the fMRI.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a block design BOLD-fMRI, we want to investigate the connectivity in brain regions when&#xD;
      two motor responses are performed in the same time. The designs will be replicated using EEG&#xD;
      and MEG to understand the time course of the activated brain network better. It will allow us&#xD;
      to map the brain processes involved in sensorimotor integration and attentional sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 individuals subdivided in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  110 adult healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  25 patients with Parkinson Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  25 patients with Focal Hand Dystonia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two experiments will be performed using MEG, EEG and fMRI techniques. Both experiments will&#xD;
      use visuo-motor control tasks. Two motor responses (given by two fingers of the dominant&#xD;
      hand) will be simultaneously performed. Experiment 1 will use single motor tasks; Experiment&#xD;
      2 will use dual motor tasks. In both experiments, the attention demands will vary with the&#xD;
      execution mode of the motor outputs (competitive or cooperative). In competitive tasks, the&#xD;
      visual stimuli will be used to perform two independent motor outputs. In cooperative tasks,&#xD;
      the visual stimuli will be used to perform two coupled motor outputs. The effect of the&#xD;
      execution mode on brain connectivity will be isolated comparing competitive and cooperative&#xD;
      tasks. The sensory information must be associated to the motor command to perform a given&#xD;
      motor task: this process is called sensorimotor integration. With both experiments, we will&#xD;
      be able to dissociate the network connectivity linked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sensorimotor integration demands for focused attention in a single task,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sensorimotor integration demands for divided attention in a dual motor task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects have been properly trained to perform the tasks, they will undergo fMRI&#xD;
      scanning MEG and EEG recording. Subjects will perform the tasks presented pseudo-randomly&#xD;
      during six sets of 5-minute sessions. We will record their muscular activity via EMG surface&#xD;
      electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are the task-dependent functional connectivity (for fMRI) between areas&#xD;
      and coherence (for MEG and EEG) of cerebral sources relative to performance of the tasks. The&#xD;
      force control of two fingers in the same time would elicit blood oxygen level dependent&#xD;
      (BOLD) signal and electrical brain activity variations in the network involved in manual&#xD;
      dexterity. We are interested in studying the connectivity between the homologous motor areas&#xD;
      of the two hemispheres, and between prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex, to understand&#xD;
      sensorimotor integration processes during competitive and cooperative dual tasks. As a second&#xD;
      measure, we are interested in analyzing coherence between MEG-EMG and EEG-EMG signals.&#xD;
