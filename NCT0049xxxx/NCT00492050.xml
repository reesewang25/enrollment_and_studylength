    <textblock>
      The main goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Velcade Â® (bortezomib) given&#xD;
      with rituximab can help to control WM. This drug combination will allow researchers to&#xD;
      collect your stem cells in case it is possible to transplant the stem cells as treatment if&#xD;
      your WM gets worse. Researchers will also look at the safety and tolerability of this drug&#xD;
      combination followed by treatment with other drug combinations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib is designed to block a protein that plays a role in cell function and growth,&#xD;
      which may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is designed to attach to cancer cells, which may cause them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and cladribine are designed to interfere with the&#xD;
      multiplication of cancer cells, which may slow or stop their growth and spread throughout the&#xD;
      body. This may cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is designed to decrease inflammation. It is also used to treat certain forms of&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests&#xD;
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. The tests may be&#xD;
      performed within 28 days of starting the study drug. You will have a physical exam, including&#xD;
      measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate),&#xD;
      height, and weight. Your medical history will be recorded. You will be asked to fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding any neuropathy (nerve problems) you may have. The questionnaire will&#xD;
      take about 1 minute to complete. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that&#xD;
      measures the electrical activity of the heart). You will also have blood (about 4-5&#xD;
      teaspoons) drawn one time and urine collected (over 24 hours) to check the status of your WM.&#xD;
      This blood is also used to screen for hepatitis. You will have an x-ray of your chest. You&#xD;
      will have computed tomography (CT) scans of your abdomen and pelvis to see which part of your&#xD;
      body is involved with WM. If your chest x-ray is positive, you will also have a CT scan of&#xD;
      your chest. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 2&#xD;
      teaspoons) or urine pregnancy test before starting the study. You will also have a bone&#xD;
      marrow aspiration and biopsy. To collect a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, an area of the hip&#xD;
      bone will be made numb with an anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone will be&#xD;
      withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to participate in this study, you will begin taking the study&#xD;
      drugs. You will be given two 35-day cycles of bortezomib and rituximab. Bortezomib will be&#xD;
      given through a needle in a vein over 3-5 seconds on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Rituximab will&#xD;
      also be given through a vein on Days 8 and 22. The first rituximab infusion (by vein) usually&#xD;
      takes 6-8 hours. Later infusions are generally shorter, taking about 4 hours to complete.&#xD;
      While you are receiving bortezomib/rituximab (for 2-3 months), valacyclovir (an anti-viral&#xD;
      drug) is taken by mouth, once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, before each dose of bortezomib, you will have blood (about 2 teaspoons each&#xD;
      time) drawn for routine tests. Your vital signs will be measured. You will be asked about any&#xD;
      side effects you may have experienced. You will also be asked to answer the questionnaire&#xD;
      about any neuropathy you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells are the cells from which all blood cells develop. If you respond to the first 2&#xD;
      cycles of bortezomib/rituximab, you will then have some of your stems cells collected. You&#xD;
      will have to sign a separate consent form that describes this procedure and its risks. After&#xD;
      the stem cell collection, 1 cycle of cladribine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab will be&#xD;
      given. Cladribine will be given through a vein once a day over 2 hours on Days 1-5.&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide is taken by mouth, twice a day on Days 1-5, and rituximab is given through a&#xD;
      vein once a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not respond to the first cycle of bortezomib/rituximab, you will be taken off the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you respond to the first but do not respond to the second cycle of bortezomib/rituximab,&#xD;
      you will receive a third cycle. The bortezomib/rituximab will be given in the same manner as&#xD;
      your first 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you respond to the third cycle of bortezomib/rituximab, you will have some of your stems&#xD;
      cells collected. After the stem cell collection, 1 cycle of cladribine, cyclophosphamide, and&#xD;
      rituximab will be given. Cladribine will be given through a vein once a day over 2 hours on&#xD;
      Days 1-5. Cyclophosphamide is taken by mouth, twice a day on Days 1-5, and rituximab is given&#xD;
      through a vein once a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not respond to the third cycle of bortezomib/rituximab, you will be given a&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen containing the drugs rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and&#xD;
      doxorubicin, together with dexamethasone. This combination is known as modified R-Hyper-CVAD.&#xD;
      Rituximab will be given through a vein over about 4 hours on Day 1 only. Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      will be given through a vein every 12 hours on Days 1-4. Doxorubicin and vincristine will be&#xD;
      given through a vein continuously over 24 hours on Days 1-4. Dexamethasone is taken by mouth&#xD;
      daily on Days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a partial response is seen with modified R-Hyper-CVAD, you will have some of your stem&#xD;
      cells collected. You will receive 1 cycle of cladribine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.&#xD;
      Cladribine will be given through a vein once a day over 2 hours on Days 1-5. Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      is taken by mouth, twice a day on Days 1-5, and rituximab is given through a vein once a week&#xD;
      for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 week before the start of each cycle of chemotherapy, you will have blood (about 4-5&#xD;
      teaspoons) drawn for routine tests and to see how your WM is responding. You may also need to&#xD;
      collect your urine over 24 hours, depending on if the first test was initially positive or&#xD;
      not. You will also have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs,&#xD;
      height, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your CT scans were positive initially, you will need to have them repeated after 2 cycles&#xD;
      of bortezomib/rituximab and then every 6 months. Once you have a partial response confirmed&#xD;
      by CT scans, you will not need to repeat the CT scans anymore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your disease does not respond to modified R-Hyper-CVAD, you will be taken off the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responding participants will be followed at least every 6 months for the first 36 months&#xD;
      (from the end of therapy). After that, you will be followed at least once a year unless the&#xD;
      disease gets worse and needs to be re-treated. For the follow-up evaluations, you will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, including measurement of vital signs. Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be&#xD;
      drawn for routine tests. Blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) and urine (over 24 hours) will be&#xD;
      collected to check the status of your WM. If the x-rays and/or CT scans done at the beginning&#xD;
      of the study were positive, you will have repeat x-rays and/or CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have not had a partial response, follow-up evaluations will be at least&#xD;
      every 3 months. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs. Blood&#xD;
      (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Blood (about 4-5 tablespoons) and&#xD;
      urine (over 24 hours) will be collected to check the status of your WM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off the study if you do not have a partial or complete response following 3&#xD;
      cycles of bortezomib/rituximab and 2 cycles of modified R-Hyper-CVAD. You will be taken off&#xD;
      the study if the disease gets worse after all planned therapy that the study doctor feels&#xD;
      requires repetition. You will be taken off the study if intolerable side effects occur. You&#xD;
      will be taken off the study if treatment with bortezomib is delayed for more than 2 weeks.&#xD;
      You will be taken off the study if you develop certain other illnesses, or if there are&#xD;
      certain changes in your health that the study doctor decides may make further treatment with&#xD;
      the study drugs to be unacceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are taken off the study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, a&#xD;
      physical exam, including measurement of vital signs, height, and weight will be performed.&#xD;
      You will be asked about any side effects that you may have experienced. You will be asked to&#xD;
      answer the questionnaire regarding any neuropathy you may have. Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of your WM. You will need to collect&#xD;
      your urine over 24 hours to see how your WM is responding. If your initial CT scans showed&#xD;
      lesions that appear to be caused by WM, you will have a CT scan repeated at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have had a partial or complete response at the end of all planned therapy, you will&#xD;
      need to return to the clinic for follow-up visits at least once every 6 months for the first&#xD;
      36 months (from the end of therapy). After that, you will have follow-up visits at least once&#xD;
      a year, unless the disease gets worse and re-treatment is necessary. At the follow-up visits,&#xD;
      you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs, height, and weight. You&#xD;
      will be asked about any side effects that you may have experienced. Blood (about 4-6&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of your WM. Depending on&#xD;
      the results of your original urine tests, you may need to collect your urine over 24 hours to&#xD;
      see how your WM is responding. If your initial CT scans showed lesions that appear to be&#xD;
      caused by WM, you will have CT scans and an x-ray of your chest repeated at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and rituximab&#xD;
      are commercially available and FDA-approved for treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.&#xD;
      Bortezomib, dexamethasone, cladribine, and the drug combinations used in this study have been&#xD;
      authorized for use in research only. Bortezomib has been FDA approved and it is registered in&#xD;
      Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior&#xD;
      therapy. Tests/procedures that are required for this study are considered to be part of your&#xD;
      routine medical care. Up to 38 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled&#xD;
      at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        <description>Partial response (PR) defined as at least &gt; 50 % reduction of serum monoclonal IgM concentration determined by protein electrophoresis, &gt; 50% decrease in adenopathy / organomegaly on physical examination or on CT scan, and no new symptoms or signs of active disease. Complete response (CR) defined as a disappearance of serum and urine monoclonal protein determined by immunofixation, absence of malignant cells in bone marrow determined by histologic evaluation, resolution of adenopathy/organomegaly (confirmed by computed tomography [CT] scan), and no signs or symptoms attributable to WM. Stable disease defined as neither grown nor shrunk; the amount of disease has not changed. Participants will be followed for &lt; 6 months after receiving bortezomib/rituximab or rituximab-modified hyper-CVAD to be considered unresponsive to therapy in accordance with the guidelines of the Consensus Panel of the Third International Workshop on Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.</description>
