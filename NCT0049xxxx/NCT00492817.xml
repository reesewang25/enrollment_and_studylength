  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if stereotactic body radiotherapy to&#xD;
      the spine using computerized tomography (CT)-on-Rails is safe and effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of metastatic spine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the safety and efficacy of using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to&#xD;
           treat spine and para-spinal tumors in a single session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document frequency and severity of pain, symptoms and symptom interference, as well as&#xD;
           quality of life before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document changes in neurological function at defined intervals compared to pre-treatment&#xD;
           neurological function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CT-on-Rails is a system that places the radiation treatment machine in the same room as the&#xD;
      CT scanner so that the CT scanner can help deliver radiation more precisely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a MRI of the spine within 1 month before registration on this study. You will&#xD;
      also fill out a health survey, a symptom inventory, and a Brief Pain Inventory within 1 week&#xD;
      before registration. Each of these surveys should take about 5 minutes to complete. You will&#xD;
      have a CT-simulation. The simulation is like a CT scan where a special body frame is used to&#xD;
      keep you from moving during scanning and later radiation treatment. However, no radiation is&#xD;
      delivered during the simulation. You will be asked questions about your medical history and&#xD;
      have a complete neurological exam during your first consultation, before registration. The&#xD;
      neurological exam involves testing upper and lower motor strength, sensation to light touch,&#xD;
      reflexes, a mental exam, and an evaluation of the way you walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation treatment will last between 2 and 2 1/2 hours and will be given on 1 day about 1 to&#xD;
      1 1/2 weeks after you had the simulation. You will have a device (similar to plastic wrap)&#xD;
      placed around you that will hold you still during the treatment. You will be checked for&#xD;
      level of pain and/or discomfort before starting each session of radiation, and you may take&#xD;
      pain medications before starting each session. All participants will be treated with&#xD;
      radiation therapy that is guided by the CT-on-Rails procedure. On the day of radiation, you&#xD;
      will also receive a CT scan using CT-on-Rails in the same treatment room, immediately before&#xD;
      the radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, a physician will be monitoring you for any side effects. If you experience&#xD;
      severe side effects, radiation treatment will be stopped, and you will be taken off study.&#xD;
      After treatment on this study ends, you will have telephone, mail, or facsimile (Fax)&#xD;
      follow-ups scheduled at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 weeks after radiation. You will be asked questions&#xD;
      about any side effects or pain you are experiencing and any other therapies you may have&#xD;
      started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow-up visits scheduled at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months and then every 6&#xD;
      months for the rest of your life. At all follow-up visits, you will be asked questions about&#xD;
      your medical history, have a neurological exam, and your neurologic function will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Any pain medication you are taking will be noted. You will be asked to have a MRI&#xD;
      of the spine at 3, 6, 9, 12,18, and 24 months, then once a year for the rest of your life.&#xD;
      You will also be asked to complete 3 questionnaires to evaluate your symptoms, pain, and&#xD;
      quality of life at each follow-up visit. Each questionnaire should take around 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The equipment used in this study are FDA-approved medical&#xD;
      devices and are commercially available. However, the way the devices are being used in this&#xD;
      study is experimental. Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled&#xD;
      at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>The validated Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), and SF-12v2 Health Survey used to assess changes in these indicators compared to pre-treatment baseline. Response determined by follow-up questionaires. Time to maximal pain relief will be the time from the first day of irradiation until the lowest pain score for average pain after radiotherapy. The &quot;worst pain score&quot; from BPI used as the marker for treatment success or failure.</description>
