      The goal of this study is to measure the amount of limb swelling (lymphedema) that sometimes&#xD;
      occurs after melanoma treatment, and to find out how people feel and react to the diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of melanoma.&#xD;

      If you choose to take part in this study, you will have measurements taken of your arms or&#xD;
      legs using a Perometer and a bioimpedance machine. The Perometer is a machine that painlessly&#xD;
      measures the fluid in your limb using two-directional infrared lights. These lights are&#xD;
      located in the frame of the machine that encircles the arm or leg during the measurement. The&#xD;
      bioimpedance is a machine that measures the fluid in your arm or leg by passing a very small&#xD;
      current through the body similar to an electrocardiogram (EKG). These very small currents are&#xD;
      located in electrodes that are placed on the hands and feet during the measurement. Both&#xD;
      machines are able to pick up changes in limb size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked to complete a set of questionnaires relating to any symptoms that you&#xD;
      may experience in your limbs and/or trunk (chest, stomach, and hip areas) during and&#xD;
      following your standard cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional questionnaires, along with your limb measurements, will be done at your&#xD;
      regularly-scheduled follow-up clinic visits, 3-6 months, 9-12 months, 15-18 months, 21-24&#xD;
      months and 27- 30 months. You will complete the additional questionnaires using a laptop&#xD;
      computer or a hardcopy. The measurements and questionnaires will take 45-60 minutes to&#xD;
      complete each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the data from this study may be sent to the University of Missouri for analysis. The&#xD;
      data that is sent will not have any personal identifiers. Researchers at University of&#xD;
      Missouri will not be able to link the data to the protected health information or personal&#xD;
      identity of any individual participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 350 patients will take part in this study. All&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
