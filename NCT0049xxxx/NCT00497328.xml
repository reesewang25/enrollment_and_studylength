&#xD;
      Treatment Groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomisation, the patient will receive one of the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine Group (NAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous infusion 154mEq/L of sodium chloride (0.9% normal saline) at a rate of&#xD;
           1mL/kg/hour from 12 hours before till 6 hours after cardiac catheterization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral NAC 1200mg dissolve in 250ml of water twice a day the day before to the day after&#xD;
           the procedure (total 6 doses)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium Bicarbonate Group (SOB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous infusion154meq/L sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose in water at a rate of 3&#xD;
           mL/kg/hour for 1 hour immediately before radiocontrast injection. For patients weighing&#xD;
           more than 110 kg, the initial fluid bolus and drip will be limited to those doses&#xD;
           administered to a patient weighing 110 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous infusion154meq/L sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose in water at a rate of 1&#xD;
           mL/kg/hour during the contrast exposure and for 6 hours after the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination Group (COM: NAC and SOB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous infusion of 154 meq/l sodium bicarbonate at a rate of 3ml/kg/hour for 1 hour&#xD;
           before cardiac catheterization and 1 ml/kg/hour till 6 hours after procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral NAC 1200mg dissolve in 250ml of water twice a day the day before to the day after&#xD;
           the procedure (total 6 doses). All patients will be monitored regularly for pulmonary&#xD;
           congestion and hemodynamics compromise hourly after PCI for 6 hours and every 4 hour&#xD;
           thereafter for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subject will be enrolled in the study for 30 days. Assessments will be done on Day&#xD;
      1,2 and 3 (48 hours after PCI) and an end of study visit at Day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast used should be non-ionic low osmolality type (such as iohexol, iopamidol,&#xD;
      ioversol,iopromide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Day 3 serum creatinine level is increased to &gt;25% above the baseline level&#xD;
      (i.e.development of CIN), patient will continune to be monitored up to a week at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator until serum creatinine level improved or CIN resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Modification&#xD;
&#xD;
      All therapies will be discontinued should adverse-effects such as cardiac failure or&#xD;
      pulmonary congestion develop, although these are anticipated to be at low event occurrence&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCOMITANT MEDICATION Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), aminoglycocide,&#xD;
      cyclosporin, cysplatin will not be allowed within 48 hours prior to PCI and throughout the&#xD;
      study duration. Metformin should be withheld 48 hours before and 48 hours after PCI. ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors can be continued at the discretion of the doctor in charge. Concomitant&#xD;
      medications or treatments received during the study must be reported on the concomitant&#xD;
      medication case report form provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study End Points and Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is development of CIN, defined as an increase in serum creatinine&#xD;
      of 25% or more within 48 hours after PCI (the efficacy parameter). Post-contrast creatinine&#xD;
      will be assessed the mornings of days 1 and 2. The highest serum creatinine on post-contrast&#xD;
      days 1 or 2 will be used to calculate the change in serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Size Based on our own and other previous data1,2,4, we assumed the development of CIN&#xD;
      of 15% in NAC, 15 % in SOB and 5 % in COM. A group sample size of 210 patients would be&#xD;
      required to detect a statistically significant difference with a power of 90% and two-tailed&#xD;
      test size of 5% between COM and either of SOB or NAC; giving a total of 630 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Analysis Analysis will be by intention-to-treat. For the efficacy parameter, a&#xD;
      comparison will be made between COM and the average of SOB and NAC (the primary analysis).&#xD;
      Pair-wise comparisons may also be made between COM and each of SOB and NAC. Tests for&#xD;
      significance will be conducted using the chi-squared test for the primary endpoint. Relative&#xD;
      risks and their 95% confidence intervals will be presented for the primary analysis and,&#xD;
      although not powered to demonstrate equivalence, between SOB and NAC. Further analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted using logistic regression to adjust for potential risk factors. For binary&#xD;
      saftey outcomes (need for hemodialysis within 30 days and 30-day mortality) and adverse&#xD;
      events, the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used. T-tests or Wilcoxon-signed&#xD;
      rank tests will be used for continuous saftey outcomes (maximum change in serum creatinine&#xD;
      level within 30 days, length of hospital stay, maximum change in GFR within 30 days and peak&#xD;
      creatinine level within 48 hours and 30 days). A two-tailed significance level of p&lt;0.05 will&#xD;
      be used for all endpoints at the final analysis.&#xD;
