      The purpose of this study is to determine whether early recurrence after curative resection&#xD;
      of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be explained by either dissemination of cancer cells&#xD;
      during intraoperative tumour manipulation, post-operative systemic immune suppression,&#xD;
      alteration of biological properties of circulating cancer cells or a combination of these.&#xD;

      Prognostic relevance of circulating cancer cells and immunosuppression in resectable&#xD;
      pancreatic carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth commonest cause of death from cancer in men and&#xD;
           women, with 5-year survival for all stages of disease of less than 5%. The case-fatality&#xD;
           rate for pancreatic cancer is extremely high and virtually identical to the number of&#xD;
           new cases (World Health Organization. World cancer report. Lyon: IACR Press; 2003). Most&#xD;
           patients with cancer of the pancreas are diagnosed at an advanced stage and have a&#xD;
           median survival of 4 to 10 months, depending on the extent of disease and irrespective&#xD;
           the type of treatment modality. Overall, fewer than 5% of the patients have resection&#xD;
           with curative intent, though over 80% will develop cancer recurrence (Jemal A, Thomas A,&#xD;
           Murray T, Thun M. Cancer Statistics. CA Cancer J Clin 2002; 52: 23-47). The primary site&#xD;
           of metastatic disease in patients with pancreatic cancer is the liver and/or the&#xD;
           peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cancer recurrence is multifactorial and determined by patient-, tumour-, and&#xD;
           surgery-related factors. Any combination of several mechanisms have been proposed by&#xD;
           which cancer may recur following potentially curative resection (Coffey JC, Wang JH,&#xD;
           Smith MJF, Bouchier-Hayes D, Cotter TG,and Redmond HP. Excisional surgery for cancer&#xD;
           cure: therapy at a cost. Lancet Oncol 2003;4:760-68). Surgery may contribute to the&#xD;
           overall residual tumor burden by adding disseminated cancer cells during tumor&#xD;
           manipulation. Due to post-operative immunosuppression the patient may become more&#xD;
           susceptible to tumorigenesis and/or disseminated cancer cells may escape the immune&#xD;
           response more easily. Finally, surgical resection may alter biological properties of&#xD;
           cancer cells and lead to increased cellular proliferation and reduced cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cancer cell dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
           Solid markers are lacking to predict cancer recurrence or cancer progression before&#xD;
           being measurable with conventional or modern diagnostic imaging. Molecular techniques&#xD;
           such as the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique have&#xD;
           proven to be a highly sensitive method and a powerful tool in the study of cancer&#xD;
           metastasis (Raj GV, Moreno JG, Gomella LG. Utilization of Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
           Technology in the Detection of Solid Tumors. Cancer 1998; 82: 1419-42). The prognostic&#xD;
           relevance of circulating cancer cells in patients with pancreatic cancer is hardly&#xD;
           studied. In patients with breast cancer the number of circulating cancer cells&#xD;
           expressing EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) has proven to be an independent&#xD;
           predictor of progression-free and overall survival (Cristofanilli M, Budd GT, Ellis MJ,&#xD;
           Stopeck A, Matera J, Miller MC, Reuben JM, Doyle GV, Allard WJ, Terstappen LW, Hayes DF.&#xD;
           Circulating tumor cells, disease progression, and survival in metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
           N Engl J Med 2004; 351: 781-91). EpCAM is a marker present on most epithelial cell&#xD;
           tumours and frequently overexpressed in primary and metastatic adenocarcinoma including&#xD;
           pancreatic cancer (Rao CG, Chianese D, Doyle GV, Miller MC, Russell T, Sanders RA Jr,&#xD;
           Terstappen LW. Expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule in carcinoma cells&#xD;
           present in blood and primary and metastatic tumors. Int J Oncol 2005; 27: 49-57). Also,&#xD;
           other markers such as CEA, CK20, K-ras have been used to detect disseminated pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer cells. In patients with colorectal carcinoma circulating cancer cells in&#xD;
           peripheral or in mesenteric venous blood as detected by RT-PCR, using CEA and CK20 mRNA&#xD;
           transcripts, seem to represent a prognostic factor (Yamaguchi K, Takagi Y, Aoki S,&#xD;
           Futamura M, Saji S. Significant detection of circulating cancer cells in the blood by&#xD;
           reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction during colorectal cancer resection. Ann&#xD;
           Surg 2000; 232: 58-65. Guller U, Zajac P, Schnider A, Bösch B, Vorburger S, Zuber M,&#xD;
           Spagnoli GC, Oertli D, Maurer R, Metzger U, Harder F, Heberer M, Marti WR. Disseminated&#xD;
           single tumor cells as detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
           represent a prognostic factor in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. Ann&#xD;
           Surg 2002; 236: 768-76).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Molecular characteristics of metastatic cancer cells&#xD;
&#xD;
           The development of metastasis is a highly selective process favoring the survival of a&#xD;
           minor subpopulation of metastatic cells. To produce metastases, tumor cells from this&#xD;
           subpopulation must complete a sequence of interrelated steps. To produce clinically&#xD;
           relevant distant metastases, the successful metastatic cell must therefore exhibit a&#xD;
           complex phenotype that is regulated by transient or permanent changes at the gene level.&#xD;
           Many malignant tumors, including pancreatic cancer, contain heterogeneous subpopulations&#xD;
           of cells. This heterogeneity is exhibited in a wide range of genetic, biochemical,&#xD;
           immunological, and biological characteristics such as growth rate, antigenic and&#xD;
           immunogenic status, cell surface receptors and products, enzymes, karyotypes, cell&#xD;
           morphologies, invasiveness, drug resistance, and metastatic potential. It is likely that&#xD;
           specific tumor cells or colonies within the larger heterogeneous tumor specimen are the&#xD;
           forerunners of distant metastases. The overall efficiency of the whole metastatic&#xD;
           process itself is low. Although the absolute number of cancer cells required for&#xD;
           metastasis in humans is unknown, a positive relationship between the number of&#xD;
           circulating cancer cells and the subsequent development of metastases has been the&#xD;
           subject of several experimental studies (Fisher, E.R. and Fisher, B. Experimental study&#xD;
           of factors influencing development of hepatic metastases from circulating tumor cells.&#xD;

           intravascular tumor cells, tumor vessels and pulmonary metastasis. Cancer Res. 34:&#xD;
           977-1004, 1974. Weiss, L., Mayhew, E., Glaves, R.P. and Holmes, J.C. Metastatic&#xD;
           inefficiency in mice bearing B16 melanomas. Br. J. Cancer 45: 44-53, 1982. Topal B,&#xD;

           dissemination during curative surgery for colorectal liver metastases. Eur J Surg Oncol&#xD;
           2005; 31: 506-511).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The poor prognosis and lack of effective treatments for pancreatic cancer arise from&#xD;
           several causes. There are currently no effective biomarkers useful for early detection&#xD;
           of pancreatic cancer that tends to rapidly invade surrounding structures and undergo&#xD;
           early metastatic spreading. Moreover, pancreatic cancer is highly resistant to both&#xD;
           chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Currently, the molecular basis for these&#xD;
           characteristics is unknown. Gene expression profiles provide important information about&#xD;
           the molecular characteristics of the cancers and can be used to distinguish closely&#xD;
           related cancer subtypes. Gene profiling can also be used to develop candidate biomarkers&#xD;
           and to identify groups of genes involved in specific functional aspects of tumor&#xD;
           biology. Gene expression profiles that could distinguish between pancreatic tumors,&#xD;
           chronic pancreatitis and normal pancreatic tissue have been studied extensively using&#xD;
           different microarrays and microarray platforms. The differentially expressed genes in&#xD;
           pancreatic tumor tissues were found to be quite specific and highly reproducible among&#xD;
           platforms and studies (Crnogorac-Jurcevic T, Efthimiou E, Nielsen T, Loader J, Terris B,&#xD;

           2003; 63: 2649-57).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Peri-operative immunological changes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Suppression of the immune system is a feature of the post-operative stress response, in&#xD;
           which natural killer (NK) and lymphocyte activated killer (LAK) cells form an integral&#xD;
           component in immune anti-tumor surveillance. However, a tumor type-specific immune&#xD;
           reaction in pancreatic cancer or in patients undergoing surgery is lacking. Anti-tumoral&#xD;
           activities of NK and LAK cells are reduced immediately after surgery so the additive&#xD;
           effects of surgery may be sufficient to improve the ability of disseminated cancer cells&#xD;
           to evade the host immune response long enough for metastases to develop (Da Costa ML,&#xD;
           Finnegan N, Flynn M, Bouchier-Hayes DJ. Laparotomy and laparoscopy differentially&#xD;
           accelerate experimental flank tumourgrowth. Br J Surg 1998; 85: 1439-42.) (Da Costa ML,&#xD;
           Redmond HP, Bouchier-Hayes DJ. The effect of laparotomy and laparoscopy on the&#xD;
           establishment of spontaneous tumour metastases. Surgery 1998; 124: 516-26).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The suppressive immunological changes that follow surgical stress occur along a temporal&#xD;
           pattern. Depression of cellular immunity to tumor-associated antigen and depression of&#xD;
           delayed-type hypersensitivity are present for up to 3 weeks after surgery. In patients&#xD;
           with pancreatic cancer the prevalence of regulatory T cells (Treg) is increased in the&#xD;
           peripheral blood as well as in the tumour microenvironment. These Treg cells (CD4+25+)&#xD;
           are phenotypically similar to Treg cells from normal donors by coexpression of CD45R0&#xD;
           and CTLA-4 molecules as well as cytokine profile. Regulatory CD4+25+ lymphocytes&#xD;
           infiltrate tumor and regional lymph nodes, and suppress activation of CD8+ lymphocytes&#xD;
           and helper CD4+25- lymphocytes (Liyanage, U. K., T. T. Moore, H. G. Joo, Y. Tanaka, V.&#xD;
           Herrmann, G. Doherty, J. A. Drebin, S. M. Strasberg, T. J. Eberlein, P. S. Goedegebuure,&#xD;
           and D. C. Linehan. 2002. Prevalence of regulatory T cells is increased in peripheral&#xD;
           blood and tumor microenvironment of patients with pancreas or breast adenocarcinoma. J&#xD;
           Immunol 169:2756).&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, the oncological significance of changes in activities and numbers of NK, LAK,&#xD;
           Treg and dendritic cells still has to be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Aims / Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is the number of circulating cancer cells a determinant for cancer recurrence&#xD;
                and/or survival following potentially curative resection of pancreatic cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is the genetic profile of circulating cancer cells a determinant for cancer&#xD;
                recurrence and/or survival following potentially curative resection of pancreatic&#xD;
                cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is peri-operative immunosuppression correlated with cancer recurrence and/or&#xD;
                survival following potentially curative resection of pancreatic cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient selection and inclusion criteria: Potentially curable/ resectable pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Quantitative analysis of circulating cancer cells&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the present study peripheral venous blood samples will be obtained before the start&#xD;
           of surgery, at the end of surgery, on the first day after and on day 7 after surgery&#xD;
           through a central venous catheter. Tumour tissue samples and random liver tru-cut&#xD;
           biopsies will be obtained intra-operatively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR technique&#xD;
           (TaqManR), based on 3 different target markers (CEA, CK20 and EpCAM mRNA transcripts)&#xD;
           and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as control gene, will be used to detect and quantify&#xD;
           circulating cancer cells in the blood stream. Normalized copy numbers (NCN) will be&#xD;
           determined in each sample (analyzed in duplicate). RNA extraction from all samples will&#xD;
           be performed using RNeasy mini kit(Qiagen, BD Company). Sample preparation, cDNA&#xD;
           synthesis and PCR will be performed in separated rooms in order to prevent&#xD;
           cross-contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Genetic profiling of disseminated cancer cells&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of mRNA extracted from the primary pancreatic tumor&#xD;
           and from disseminated cancer cells before, during and the day after surgery. The focus&#xD;
           of this study is not to identify specific markers for diagnosis or for drug targets but&#xD;
           to find indications of metastasis through the study of gene expression in cancer cells&#xD;
           circulating in the bloodstream. Our main objective is to analyze expression profiles of&#xD;
           circulating pancreatic cancer cells. Changes will be analyzed in the expression of genes&#xD;
           representative of several different pathways frequently altered during the progression&#xD;
           of cancer such as tumor suppressors, oncogenes, signal transduction molecules, growth&#xD;
           factors and angiogenesis factors. Gene expression profile data will be obtained on&#xD;
           apoptosis, cell cycle, cell growth and differentiation, cell migration and motility,&#xD;
           signal transduction and other cancer-related genes. Latest developments in microarray&#xD;
           technology comprise the manufacturing of the complete genome and in designing new&#xD;
           amplification strategies to be able to analyze very small samples less than 1 ng total&#xD;
           RNA (Xiang CC, Chen M, Kozhich OA, Phan QN, Inman JM, Chen Y, Brownstein MJ. Probe&#xD;
           generation directly from small number of cells for DNA microarray studies. Biotechniques&#xD;
           2003; 34: 386-8, 390, 392-3. Schindler H, Wiese A, Auer J, Burtscher H. cRNA target&#xD;

           different amplification procedures. Anal Biochem 2005; 344: 92-101. Puskás LG, Zvara Á,&#xD;

           with slight ratio bias. Biotechniques 2002; 32: 1330-1341). In the present study the&#xD;
           number of cancer cells circulating in the blood stream is expected to be extremely&#xD;
           small. Therefore, linear RNA amplification (T7 RNA-polymerase) is used in order to&#xD;
           generate enough material for labeling and hybridization on the arrays. Two rounds of&#xD;
           amplification are performed routinely. This has been performed successfully and&#xD;
           reproducibly starting from as little as 700 cells isolated via Laser Capture&#xD;
           Microdissection (data unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Preparation of cell suspension microarrays to isolate circulating cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although most of the microarray challenges are known and under control, the present&#xD;
           study has an important specific challenge that is the isolation and enrichment of the&#xD;
           circulating cancer cells. Currently, the proportion of circulating cancer cells to other&#xD;
           nucleated blood cells (leucocytes) is unknown in patients suffering from pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer. Therefore, the first step will be to determine the number of cancer cells per ml&#xD;
           blood in pancreatic cancer patients and to determine the variability among different&#xD;
           patients. A second step is to develop an enrichment method to concentrate the cancer&#xD;
           cells without selecting specific types of cancer cells or loss of information on the&#xD;
           initial proportion of cancer cells in each patient's blood stream. The fastest way to&#xD;
           isolate the circulating cancer cells is using flow cytometry after density-gradient&#xD;
           pre-enrichment in combination with negative selection strategies to discard leukocytes&#xD;
           (CD45+ and CD34+) from the sorted 'circulating' cancer cells. Isolating cells with LCM&#xD;
           has been used many times successfully for microarray studies. It has been reported that&#xD;
           LCM can easily dissect several thousands of cells from pancreatic tissue with a&#xD;
           RNA-yield of around 1ng/1000 cells (Datson NA, Meijer L, Steenbergen PJ. Morsiak MC, van&#xD;

&#xD;
           - Immunological changes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since a tumor type-specific immune reaction in pancreatic cancer or in patients&#xD;
           undergoing surgery is lacking, the present study will assess the systemic immunological&#xD;
           changes including cytokine levels before and at different time intervals following&#xD;
           potentially curative surgery in pancreatic cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PBMC will be extracted from peripheral venous blood and used for further analysis under&#xD;
           FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) to determine the prevalence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CD3-19+ (B-lymphocytes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CD3+56+ (Killer cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CD3-56+CD16+ (NK natural killer cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CD8+ (Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CD4+25- (Helper T-lymphocytes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CD4+25+127- (Regulatory T-lymphocytes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and&#xD;
                TNF) will be analysed using a commercially available 'BD Cytometric Bead Array&#xD;
                (CBA) Human Inflammatory Kit'.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and tumour tissue will be stored in&#xD;
                liquid nitrogen for analysis in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Univariate analysis as well as corrected, multivariate analysis will be performed in&#xD;
           order to identify the optimally combined prognostic group of factors: patient-, tumour-,&#xD;
           and treatment-associated factors as well as the amounts of disseminated cancer cells,&#xD;
           their genetic expression profile and immunological changes following surgery. The events&#xD;
           to study will be cancer recurrence (disease free survival DFS) and death (overall&#xD;
           survival OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Expected patient accrual &quot;Single center study&quot;: UZ.Gasthuisberg - KU.Leuven, Belgium&#xD;
           Expected annual patient registration: 30 pts / year Duration of patient accrual: 2 years&#xD;
