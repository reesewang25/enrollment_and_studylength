  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalizations for acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) are associated with a high&#xD;
      rehospitalisation and mortality rate. The aim of this study is to assess if the measurement&#xD;
      of NT-proBNP levels before discharge may improve the prognosis of the patients recently&#xD;
      admitted to hospital for AHFS&#xD;

      Study population. We will include into the study patients admitted to our institute for AHFS&#xD;
      with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms. All patients should have&#xD;
      evidence of symptomatic heart failure with symptoms at rest or during minimal exercise&#xD;
      requiring intravenous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should give their written informed consent before entry into the study. Patients&#xD;
      with clinical or laboratory evidence of an acute coronary syndrome as well as patients with&#xD;
      major arrhythmias will be excluded if these conditions are likely to be the main cause of the&#xD;
      symptoms. In contrast, patients with aspecific electrocardiographic ST segment changes and/or&#xD;
      with a slight elevation of plasma troponin levels may be included as these conditions are&#xD;
      known to be frequently associated with AHFS and it is generally not possible to establish to&#xD;
      which extent they are the cause rather than the consequence of the hemodynamic&#xD;
      decompensation. The patients in whom a coronary revascularization procedure (either PTCA or&#xD;
      CABG) is planned in the next 3 months and the patients with non cardiac concomitant diseases&#xD;
      that may influence outcome as primary factor will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. Blood samples for the assessment of NT-proBNP plasma levels will be obtained in&#xD;
      all the patients at at least two time intervals: pre-discharge (e.g. 24 to 72 hours before&#xD;
      the planned date of discharge) and at discharge (e.g. at the day of discharge). Pre-discharge&#xD;
      samples will be taken when the patient is clinically stable, on the same oral drugs and at&#xD;
      the same doses which are planned to be administered after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be randomised according to a previous randomization scheme to two groups:&#xD;
      control group, in which the results of NT-proBNP levels will be known only retrospectively,&#xD;
      at the end of the trial; intervention group, in which the values of pre-discharge NT-proBNP&#xD;
      plasma levels will be known by the investigator on the day after that of the blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, it will be possible to change medical treatment and, if needed,&#xD;
      prolong the hospitalization, in the case that the pre-discharge NT-proBNP levels are &gt;3000&#xD;
      pg/mL. This value has been associated with a 13-fold increase in mortality and heart failure&#xD;
      rehospitalisation rates in patients recently admitted for AHFS. (Eur J Heart Fail. 2007 Jun&#xD;
      15; [Epub ahead of print] PMID: 17573240) The following changes of treatment will be&#xD;
      possible: increase in the dose of the diuretic, association of a different diuretic (e.g. an&#xD;
      aldosterone antagonist); combination of digoxin therapy; increase in the dose of the&#xD;
      rennin-angiotensin inhibitor; association of an angiotensin receptor blocker; association of&#xD;
      a nitrate; short course of i.v. diuretic, vasodilator and/or inotropic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma levels of NT-proBNP will then be measured at discharge. It is our aim to use in the&#xD;
      intervention group a treatment modality similar to that which may be expected if NT-proBNP&#xD;
      levels are used to guide therapy. Therefore, the clinical investigator assessing these&#xD;
      patients may require to the laboratory knowledge of the discharge NT-proBNP levels and delay&#xD;
      patient's discharge and further adjust treatment, in case that the response to treatment&#xD;
      (e.g. the decrease in NT-proBNP levels) be found as insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, a further assessment of plasma NT-proBNP levels will be repeated 7&#xD;
      to 21 days after discharge. If the NT-propBNP levels will still be elevated at that time, the&#xD;
      investigator may further change medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A satisfactory change in NT-ProBNP plasma levels is defined a priori as either one of the&#xD;
      following: a) a decrease in plasma NT-proBNP below 3000 pg/mL (a value which has been&#xD;
      associated with a favourable prognosis in our previous study group); b) a decrease &gt; 30% from&#xD;
      the first values detected (i.e. those measured 24 to 72 hours before discharge). This&#xD;
      percentage is based on previous studies regarding both the prognostic value of serial changes&#xD;
      in NT-proBNP levels and their spontaneous week to week variability in clinically stable heart&#xD;
      failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional exams. During the hospitalization, all patients will have at least daily&#xD;
      assessments of their clinical conditions with medical treatment titrated to obtain clinical&#xD;
      stability and symptoms relief, if possible. The investigator will be unaware of the&#xD;
      randomization code until the day of the pre-discharge sample. No differences in baseline&#xD;
      clinical characteristics, hospitalization duration before the planned discharge and&#xD;
      in-hospital treatment are expected between the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will undergo a standard Doppler-echocardiography and chest-X ray at least&#xD;
      once during the hospitalization. The 6 minutes walk distance will be measured when the&#xD;
      patient will be clinically stable, before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up. Each patient will undergo a clinical visit or a telephone assessment of his/her&#xD;
      clinical conditions at 1 and 3 months after discharge and every 6 months thereafter until the&#xD;
      end of the study. Unplanned ambulatory visits will be allowed based on the clinical&#xD;
      conditions and needs of the patient. An echocardiographic exam and the assessment of the 6&#xD;
      minutes walk distance will be repeated 6 months after the initial hospitalization. Standard&#xD;
      laboratory exams will be repeated at 1, 3 and 6 months after discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Main outcome: Incidence of unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization and&#xD;
      cardiac deaths at 6 months in the control and the intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Incidence of cardiac mortality alone; combined incidence of cardiac&#xD;
      deaths, cardiovascular hospitalizations and unplanned ambulatory visits; number of days spent&#xD;
      in hospital during the first hospitalization; number of days spent in the hospital during&#xD;
      follow-up; changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction, volumes and filling patterns&#xD;
      from the first hospitalization to after 6 months; changes in NYHA class and in 6 minutes walk&#xD;
      distance; changes in renal function from baseline to discharge and from discharge to the&#xD;
      reassessment at 1, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
