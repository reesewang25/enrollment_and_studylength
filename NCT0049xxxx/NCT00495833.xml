      Overview: This study uses communications strategies delivered through the traditional&#xD;
      emergency medical response system to increase the proportion of low-income adults who obtain&#xD;
      blood pressure screening and follow-up information for hypertension treatment options. The&#xD;
      project will test the effectiveness of source personalization and tailored messaging in&#xD;
      motivating potentially high-risk people, identified by 911 responders, to come to a local&#xD;
      fire station for hypertension screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the effectiveness of three health marketing approaches to motivate high-risk&#xD;
           people, identified via 911 responders, to come to a local fire station for hypertension&#xD;
           screening. The mailed marketing approaches vary personalized risk information and&#xD;
           personalization of source.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the effectiveness of two mailing interventions (blood pressure kits with and&#xD;
           without promotional gifts) to increase blood pressure monitoring among patients who have&#xD;
           come to a fire station for a second blood pressure check.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertension, if left untreated, is a major risk factor for stroke, heart attack, heart&#xD;
      failure or kidney failure. Many people with hypertension don't know they have the disease&#xD;
      and/or may be under treated. As such they are at higher risk for health complications than&#xD;
      those who are managing their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who see a regular healthcare provider are more likely to know they have hypertension,&#xD;
      and they are more likely to receive appropriate treatment. However, many patients who call&#xD;
      9-1-1 for emergency medical services (EMS) do not have regular health care providers and may&#xD;
      be more at risk for undiagnosed or under treated disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMS personnel enter the homes of thousands of residents each year. Emergency medical&#xD;
      technicians (EMTs) routinely take patients' blood pressure as part of their standard&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures. EMTs and paramedics complete a medical incident report form (MIRF) for&#xD;
      each patient, including this information. As recorded on the MIRFs, thousands of patients&#xD;
      have high blood pressure (defined by a systolic measurement of 160 or higher and/or a&#xD;
      diastolic measurement of 100 or higher) during those visits. Blood pressure may be elevated&#xD;
      simply from the stress and anxiety of a 9-1-1 response. But even in light of this potential&#xD;
      &quot;white coat&quot; phenomenon, blood pressure readings at these levels are very high and are a&#xD;
      cause for concern, especially in cases where patients are not transported to the hospital for&#xD;
      further examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From February - April, 2007 we are collecting baseline data on patients who have high blood&#xD;
      pressure readings (160/100 or higher) at a 9-1-1 response by an EMT (SPHERE Hypertension&#xD;
      Baseline Data Study). We want to understand what these patients remember during the 9-1-1&#xD;
      response around their high blood pressure measure, if the patients seek a second reading, and&#xD;
      if the patients seek follow-up care as a result of the high blood pressure measure. We are&#xD;
      also interested to learn if patients trust EMTs as a provider of preventive health care. This&#xD;
      baseline data will also allow us to more accurately measure the success of this proposed&#xD;
      intervention study. The baseline data collection is almost completed and we now will proceed&#xD;
      with an intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct an intervention study next, aimed at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motivating subjects to receive a follow-up hypertension assessment from an EMT at a&#xD;
           local fire station after receiving a high blood pressure reading from an EMT during a&#xD;
           911 event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motivating subjects to monitor their blood pressure as appropriate.&#xD;
