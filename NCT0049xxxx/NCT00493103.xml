    <textblock>
      Congenital goitrous hypothyroid is commonly linked to thyroglobulin (TG) gene mutations.We&#xD;
      aim to identify mutations in the TG gene that might be present in patients with fetal goiter&#xD;
      and congenital goiter hypothyroidism.Four related patients with congenital goiter&#xD;
      hypothyroidism from an inbred family were studied.Recombinant human TSH stimulation test, DNA&#xD;
      sequencing and protein computer analysis were performed.We identified a novel compound&#xD;
      heterozygous constellation (IVS30+1G&gt;T/A2215D) in two siblings. It was also identified a&#xD;
      homozygous intronic mutation (IVS30+1G&gt;T) in their cousins, one of them with fetal goiter.&#xD;
      The mutation IVS30+1G&gt;T promotes an aberrant splicing and loss of the entire exon 30 (138 nt)&#xD;
      in the resulting messenger RNA. The recent described mutation A2215D is located in the&#xD;
      ACHE-like domain, which functions as a dimerization domain, facilitating efficient&#xD;
      intracellular transport of the protein. Protein computer analysis suggested that the A2215D&#xD;
      mutation causes TG structural alterations.A novel compound heterozygous constellation&#xD;
      (IVS30+1G&gt;T/A2215D) and the previously described mutation (IVS30+1G&gt;T) that cause severe&#xD;
      congenital hypothyroidism due to defective TG synthesis have been identified. The mutation&#xD;
      IVS30+1G&gt;T may be related to fetal goiter and hypothyroidism due to TG instability and&#xD;
      impaired TG export to the colloid. This study shows the efficiency of the use of rhTSH in the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of CH due to TG defective synthesis and the importance of molecular&#xD;
      diagnosis of CH for possible intrauterine treatment, thereby avoiding damage to the&#xD;
      neuropsychomotor system.&#xD;
