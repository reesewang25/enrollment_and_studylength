      There are worrying signs that parasitological responses to the artemisinin drugs for&#xD;
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria are slower than elsewhere in the world.If responses to&#xD;
      artesunate are poor it is essential to have characterised the blood concentration profile as&#xD;
      well as the parasitological response to differentiate resistance from abnormal&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the level of resistance to artemisinin&#xD;
      derivatives in Western Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed evaluation of 2 different artesunate containing regimens in patients with&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria will be performed. Patients will be randomised to receive either a)&#xD;
      Artesunate 2mg/kg/day for 7 days or b) Artesunate 4mg/kg/day for 3 days plus mefloquine&#xD;
      15mg/kg on day 3 and 10mg/kg on day 4 The effect on parasite clearance and cure will be&#xD;
      assessed in relation to blood concentrations of the antimalarial drugs ('PK-PD').&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the level of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in Western Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the level of resistance to other antimalarial drugs in Western Cambodia&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background; There are worrying signs from Western Cambodia that parasitological&#xD;
           responses to artesunate and artemether containing treatment regimens for uncomplicated&#xD;
           falciparum malaria are slower than elsewhere in the world [1-4]. Both delayed parasite&#xD;
           clearance and unusually high failure rates with artesunate-mefloquine and&#xD;
           artemether-lumefantrine have been reported [1,2]. Although occasional poor responses to&#xD;
           artesunate have been described previously [5] the current reports suggest a consistent&#xD;
           problem. As the rate of parasite clearance is a good pharmacodynamic measure of efficacy&#xD;
           of the artemisinin related compounds [6,7], this could indicate the emergence of&#xD;
           significant resistance[8]. These antimalarials are central to current treatment&#xD;
           strategies[9], and so spread of significant resistance outside this area would be a&#xD;
           disaster. Radical containment measures might be needed. In this context there is an&#xD;
           urgent need to proceed quickly to investigate the level of resistance to artemisinin&#xD;
           derivatives in Western Cambodia to provide a definitive assessment so that if necessary&#xD;
           containment plans can be developed in 2007. A group of malaria investigators from&#xD;
           Cambodia and Thailand have joined together to address this urgent question as quickly&#xD;
           and effectively as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial described here proposes to assess the current recommended doses given in the&#xD;
           normal way, and if necessary a higher dose of artesunate. There is no known dose related&#xD;
           toxicity with artesunate, and doses up to 10mg/kg/day have been given (by us) without&#xD;
           any adverse effects[10]. The two features of this study which differ from normal studies&#xD;
           in uncomplicated malaria are the repeated blood sampling and the 7 day in-patient stay.&#xD;
           If responses to artesunate are poor it is essential to have characterised the blood&#xD;
           concentration profile as well as the parasitological response to differentiate&#xD;
           resistance from abnormal pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General Plan; The situation was reviewed in open forum by malaria experts from Cambodia,&#xD;
           Thailand, and WHO, and was considered sufficiently worrying to prompt planning of an&#xD;
           urgent investigation under the aegis of the Mekong Malaria Programme. First it is&#xD;
           necessary to determine the level of in-vivo and in-vitro susceptibility to artemisinin&#xD;
           derivatives. This will involve detailed clinical and laboratory studies associated with&#xD;
           simultaneous assessment in-vitro in several laboratories including - A. National Malaria&#xD;
           Control Programme, Pnomh Penh B. Mahidol Oxford Research Unit (MORU), Bangkok. C.&#xD;
           Institut Pasteur, Pnomh Penh. D. Family Health International, Asia-Pacific Regional&#xD;
           Office&#xD;
&#xD;
           If artemisinin resistance is confirmed then&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. plans for containment will need to be developed urgently.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. molecular genetic studies will be conducted to determine the basis of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Epidemiological and behavioural studies will be conducted to inform how resistance&#xD;
                may have been selected and how it might be contained&#xD;
&#xD;
           This proposal describes the initial clinical studies which would be conducted by the&#xD;
           Mahidol-University Research Unit, Bangkok together Family Health International under the&#xD;
           leadership of the Cambodian NMCP. This will be an open randomised PK-PD comparison of&#xD;
           artesunate versus artesunate-mefloquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This clinical study will be conducted in Pailin, where poor parasitological responses to&#xD;
           artesunate have been documented. FHI took on the management of a village malaria worker&#xD;
           programme in Pailin, previously developed by MSF, and have developed the clinical&#xD;
           facility. Trials of artesunate-pyronaridine, coordinated by FHI are now taking place&#xD;
           there.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Method A detailed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation of artesunate in acute&#xD;
           uncomplicated falciparum malaria will be conducted in Pailin Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.1.Timing Rainy season (May to December) 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.2. Patients Children &gt;5yrs and adults presenting with acute falciparum malaria&#xD;
           (N=40) to Pailin hospital will be eligible for inclusion in this study provided that&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. They or their parents/guardians give fully informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. They are not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. They have not received antimalarial drugs in the previous 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. P.falciparum parasitaemia exceeds 10,000/uL.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Microscopy does not indicate a mixed infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. There is no history of allergy to artesunate or mefloquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. They agree to 7 days hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.3. Recruitment, randomization and enrolment: Fever patients in the villages&#xD;
           surrounding Pailin or in Pailin itself will be screened with a PfHRP2-based malaria&#xD;
           rapid test (ParacheckR) by the village malaria workers. In case of a positive test&#xD;
           result, the patient will be transported by the study team to Pailin Referral Hospital,&#xD;
           where further consent and enrolment procedures will be conducted. It will be made clear&#xD;
           from the outset that refusal to participate will in no way jeopardize subsequent&#xD;
           antimalarial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.4.Patient information and remuneration The details of the study and the reason for&#xD;
           the study will be explained in Khmer to the patients and relatives. It will be explained&#xD;
           clearly that if the patient does not want to participate or continue with the study then&#xD;
           this will not affect their treatment in any way. Patients will be recompensed for the&#xD;
           stay in hospital and travel expenses for each outpatient visit at an appropriate local&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the patient fulfils the entry criteria and informed consent is obtained, the patient&#xD;
           will be entered into the study. Basic demographic and clinical parameters, including&#xD;
           blood pressure and pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, weight, spleen and liver&#xD;
           size, will be entered into a case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.5. Randomisation Computer-based randomisation will be balanced in previously&#xD;
           prepared blocks of 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.6. 'Repeated dose' If the patient vomits within half an hour after intake of the&#xD;
           antimalarial drugs, the dose will be repeated. If vomiting occurs between half and a&#xD;
           whole hour, half of the dose will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.7. 'Rescue treatment' If a patient develops signs of severe malaria, parenteral&#xD;
           artesunate and parenteral quinine will be given in standard doses [9]. The combination&#xD;
           is safe, and would be expected to be effective in case of high level artemisinin&#xD;
           resistance [11]. If the patient has a less than 75% fall in parasitaemia by day 3 or has&#xD;
           any persisting parasitaemia by day 7, he/she will require rescue treatment consisting of&#xD;
           artesunate 6 mg/kg in combination with doxycycline 4 mg/kg for 7 days. In children below&#xD;
           the age of 8, doxycycline should be replaced by clindamycin (10 mg/kg/dose, two times a&#xD;
           day for 7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Procedures On enrollment a detailed history and full clinical examination will be&#xD;
           performed and recorded on a standard CRF. Part of the blood sample will be taken at&#xD;
           baseline for immediate culture (for an in-vitro susceptibility test) and also storage of&#xD;
           parasites (cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen), parasite DNA and mRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.1. Drugs Patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Artesunate (Guilin Pharmaceutical Company, PRC) 2mg/kg/day for 7 days.&#xD;
                N=20………………………………………………………………………….AS7&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Artesunate (Guilin Pharmaceutical Company, PRC) 4mg/kg/day for 3 days plus&#xD;
                mefloquine 15mg/kg on day 3 and 10mg/kg on day 4&#xD;
                N=20………………………………………………………………………MAS3&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.2. Blood collection on admission On admission blood will be collected for parasite&#xD;
           count (thin and thick films stained by Field's method), CBC, and routine biochemistry.&#xD;
           An additional 20 ml of blood will be collected in a sterile heparinised tube for&#xD;
           parasite culture and cryopreservation, and 2 ml for assessment of drug levels&#xD;
           (artesunate and mefloquine). The maximum volume taken from children &lt; 10yrs is 10mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.4. Follow-up Patients will remain in hospital for 7 days or longer if parasites have&#xD;
           not cleared. They will then be followed for 42 days and at each weekly visit will have a&#xD;
           haematocrit and parasite count checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3. Recurrent parasitaemia In case of recurrent falciparum malaria blood will be taken&#xD;
           for cryopreserving parasites, antimalarial drug levels, for assessment of genotyping and&#xD;
           gene expression (22mL). The maximum volume taken from children &lt; 10yrs is 10mL. In case&#xD;
           of recurrent parasitaemia, more than 3 days after the initiation of treatment, DNA will&#xD;
           be isolated from from blood samples. Paired samples from every patient, taken at initial&#xD;
           enrolment and at time of recurrence, will then be genotyped on the basis of&#xD;
           polymorphisms in the genes for the merozoite surface proteins MSP-2 and MSP-1 and GLURP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurements and analysis This is essentially a descriptive study so no formal sample&#xD;
           size calculation is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Drug assays Artesunate, dihydroartemisinin and mefloquine will be measured in&#xD;
           plasma samples. These assays will be performed in the MORU laboratories Bangkok.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1.2. Analysis of PK data Conventional and population pharmacokinetic analyses will be&#xD;
           performed (MORU). A PK-PD model will then be constructed. Artesunate and mefloquine will&#xD;
           be characterized by conventional and population pharmacokinetic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A population based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling approach will be used to&#xD;
           describe the antimalarial effect of artesunate in patients with acute falciparum&#xD;
           malaria. The objective of the modelling exercise is to characterise the relationship&#xD;
           between pharmacokinetic variables and parasite clearance measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinical and parasitological responses will be compared with previous data from&#xD;
           Thailand and Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 In-vitro testing On-site PfHRP2 based in-vitro testing will be performed . Parasites&#xD;
           will be transported to Pnomh Penh and also cryopreserved for later testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.1. Molecular studies There will baseline genotyping as described above and also&#xD;
           systematic screening for mixed infections. Putative resistance genes will be sequenced&#xD;
           (e.g. PfATPase6) or copy number and expression assessed (PfMDR1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Interim review and options for dose adjustment Monthly updates on recruitment and&#xD;
           therapeutic responses will be provided to all participants from the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Artesunate should produce parasite reduction ratios of approximately 10,000/cycle, which&#xD;
           result in parasite clearance times which are usually less than 48 hours. If six patients&#xD;
           in either treatment group have PCTs &gt;96 hours then the dosage of artesunate in that&#xD;
           treatment arm will be increased AS7 2mg/kg/day increases to AS7 4mg/kg/day MAS3&#xD;
           4mg/kg/day increases to MAS3 6mg/kg/day The sample size will be reviewed at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment of recurrent falciparum malaria infections Patients with recurrent infections&#xD;
           will receive an increased dose of artesunate in the retreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent infections following the 7 day regimen will receive artesunate 4 mg/kg/day for 7&#xD;
      days. Recurrences following the MAS3 regimen will receive artesunate 6 mg/kg/day for 7 days&#xD;
      Children aged over 8 years will receive doxycycline 200mg day in addition, and those between&#xD;
      6 and 8 will receive clindamycin 10mg/kg bid Patients with recrudescences will be restudied&#xD;
      as above provided they agree.&#xD;
