      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of HspE7 and Poly-ICLC&#xD;
      when given together&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 600 million people worldwide are infected with the Human Papilloma Virus. In&#xD;
      the majority of cases people can clear the virus on their own however in cases where the&#xD;
      infection is not recognized or is left untreated, the result can be cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the safety and tolerability of Hsp-E7 and Poly-ICLC administered&#xD;
      together as a vaccine for Cervical Intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). There will be 4 cohorts&#xD;
      of subjects in the study each given a higher dose than the one prior providing that prior&#xD;
      dose has been well tolerated and deemed to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be immunized every 28 days for a period of 8 weeks (3 administrations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posttreatment evaluation will occur 4 weeks after the last of 3 injections. Subjects with CIN&#xD;
      2 or 3 disease at the time of enrollment will be eligible to undergo clinically appropriate&#xD;
      therapeutic treatment of the cervix at the twelfth of the study.&#xD;

             period) as determined by the Investigator (eg: oral contraceptives, injectables or&#xD;
             implants, intrauterine device, double-barrier methods). The use of cervical cap or&#xD;
             diaphram is not permitted).&#xD;

          3. Geographically accessible for ongoing follow up and committed to comply with all&#xD;
             visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Judged to be in good health based upon the results of a medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, vital signs and laboratory profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;

             and hepatitis C Virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior to Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior exposure to HspE7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject received immunotherapy (eg, interferons, tumor necrosis factor,&#xD;
             interleukins, or biological response modifiers [GM CSF, G CSF, M CSF]) within 4 weeks&#xD;
             (28 days) prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Taken within 7 days or is currently taking selective Cox-2 inhibitors and other&#xD;
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Has a history of severe allergic reaction to insect bites or stings, or to any&#xD;
