  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the validity of the prediction model in reducing the&#xD;
      rate of CPAP titration failure and in achieving a shorter time to optimal pressure&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to derive the most effective pressure, CPAP titration is performed in the sleep&#xD;
      laboratory during which the pressure is gradually increased until apneas and hypopneas are&#xD;
      abolished in all sleep stages and in all body positions. The technique is however time&#xD;
      consuming and labor intensive. Furthermore, the duration of the study may not be sufficient&#xD;
      to attain this goal because of patient's poor ability to sleep in this environment or due to&#xD;
      difficulty in attaining an appropriate pressure. A predictive algorithm based on demographic,&#xD;
      anthropometric, and polysomnographic data was developed to facilitate the selection of a&#xD;
      starting pressure during the overnight titration study. Yet, the performance of this model&#xD;
      was inconsistent when validated by other centers. One of the potential reasons for the lack&#xD;
      of reproducibility is the complex relation of behavioral processes with nonlinear attributes.&#xD;
      In areas of complex interactions, the artificial neural network (ANN) has been found to be a&#xD;
      more appropriate alternative to linear, parametric statistical tools due to its inherent&#xD;
      property of seeking information embedded in relations among variables thought to be&#xD;
      independent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: time to achieve optimal pressure in the conventional technique versus the&#xD;
      intervention model&#xD;
