      Specific aim To examine the effect of catecholamines on the modulation of intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia induced TNF- in human monocytes from both healthy subjects and OSA patients (2). To&#xD;
      map the signaling pathway of catecholamines regulating the intermittent hypoxia induced TNF-&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3). To explore the potential therapeutic effects of  or  agonists/antagonists on&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxia induced TNF- expression&#xD;

      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disease, which occurs in 4% middle-aged&#xD;
      men and 2% middle-aged women. The characteristic of OSA is recurrent collapse of upper airway&#xD;
      during sleep, which results in intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic activation.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular complications associated with OSA include artherosclerosis, hypertension,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. Several inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      including C-reactive protein (CRP), oxidative stress, adhesion molecules, vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor and proinflammatory cytokines, were found to be elevated in OSA,&#xD;
      which attribute the developments of cardiovascular diseases in OSA. Our data showed serum&#xD;
      levels of TNF were higher in OSA patients than in control subjects. And serum levels of TNF&#xD;
      were inversely correlated with the lowest pulse oxygen saturation. After one-month CPAP&#xD;
      treatment, serum of TNF could significantly go down. This finding suggested TNF was a good&#xD;
      biomarker in studying OSA associated cardiovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presentations of sympathetic hyperactivity in OSA include hypercatecholaminemia and&#xD;
      elevated sympathetic tone of peripheral nerve. Hypercatecholaminemia is known for attributing&#xD;
      to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Our data showed plasma levels of both&#xD;
      epinephrine and norepinephrine were higher in OSA patients than in control subjects. And the&#xD;
      elevated catecholamine could go down after one-month CPAP treatment. Meanwhile, our data also&#xD;
      showed the plasma levels of catecholamine were highly correlated with serum levels of TNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo studies showed both epinephrine and norepinephrine could potentiate LPS-induced&#xD;
      expression of TNF through 2 adrenergic receptors. However, the effect of catecholamine on&#xD;
      TNF production in human monocytes in the hypoxic microenvironment has never been studied.&#xD;
      Our preliminary data showed epinephrine had no effect on TNF expression in human monocyte&#xD;
      cell line U937 under normoxic condition but could attenuate the TNF expression under hypoxic&#xD;
      condition. Therefore, we hypothesize that catecholamines can modulate intermittent hypoxia&#xD;
      induced TNF and further affect the developments of cardiovascular complications in OSA. In&#xD;
      this project, we'll use peripheral blood monocytes from healthy subjects and OSA patients as&#xD;
      the target cells, which were serially treated with catecholamine  or b antagonists in both&#xD;
      normoxic and hypoxic microenvironments, to achieve the following 3 objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . To examine the effect of catecholamines on the modulation of intermittent hypoxia&#xD;
           induced TNF- in human monocytes from both healthy subjects and OSA patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . To map the signaling pathway of catecholamines regulating the intermittent hypoxia&#xD;
           induced TNF- expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . To explore the potential therapeutic effects of  or  agonists/antagonists on&#xD;
           intermittent hypoxia induced TNF- expression&#xD;
