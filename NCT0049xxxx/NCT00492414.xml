      Panic disorder(PD)is a disabling psychiatric condition associated with significant impairment&#xD;
      in psychosocial, occupational functioning and quality of life, as mentioned by mogotsi et al.&#xD;

      occupational function. This impairment is not only individual problem, but also social one.&#xD;

      workers with psychiatric illness should be reduced by the proper management. But few data&#xD;
      were reported in this field by now.&#xD;
