  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In normal men, the male hormone testosterone affects a number of things in the body including&#xD;
      muscle function and sexual function. An enzyme in the body called 5-alpha reductase converts&#xD;
      testosterone into another form called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which has slightly different&#xD;
      effects. The purpose of this study is to find out how different amounts of the two different&#xD;
      forms of testosterone affect muscle function and sexual function in healthy young men like&#xD;
      you. This will be done by giving the men participating in the study different combinations of&#xD;
      hormone-related medication for 20 weeks and making measurements before, during and after the&#xD;
      medications to look for changes in lean body tissue, muscle size, muscle strength and leg&#xD;
      power, as well as sexual function and sexual activity in all participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Testosterone, the predominant circulating androgen in men, also serves as a prohormone that&#xD;
      is converted in the body to two active metabolites, estradiol 17 β and 5-α DHT (DHT).&#xD;
      Testosterone serves as the active hormone in some target tissues; however, androgen effects&#xD;
      in other target organs require its conversion to estradiol or DHT. The role of 5-α reduction&#xD;
      of testosterone in mediating its effects on the muscle and sexual function remains unclear.&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to determine whether 5-α reduction of&#xD;
      testosterone to DHT is obligatory for mediating its effects on fat-free mass, muscle size,&#xD;
      muscle strength, and leg power in men. The secondary objective is to determine whether 5-α&#xD;
      reduction of testosterone is necessary for maintenance of androgen effects on sexual function&#xD;
      (sexual desire, overall sexual activity, nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT), response to&#xD;
      visual erotic stimulus, and penile rigidity) in men. In order to test these hypotheses about&#xD;
      the role of 5-α reduction, we will compare testosterone dose response curves for each outcome&#xD;
      measure in the absence and presence of a novel, potent 5-α reductase inhibitor (dutasteride)&#xD;
      that inhibits both type 1 and type 2 steroid 5-α -reductase isoenzymes. Healthy young men,&#xD;
      21-40 years of age, will be treated with a long acting GnRH agonist to suppress endogenous&#xD;
      testosterone production, and concomitantly, randomly assigned to one of 8 groups: group 1,&#xD;
      testosterone enanthate (TE) 50-mg weekly, plus placebo tablets daily; group 2, TE 125-mg&#xD;
      weekly plus placebo daily; group 3, TE 300-mg weekly plus placebo daily; group 4, TE 600 mg&#xD;
      TE weekly plus placebo; group 5, 50-mg weekly, plus dutasteride 2.5-mg daily; group 6, TE&#xD;
      125-mg weekly, plus dutasteride daily; group 7, TE 300 mg weekly, plus dutasteride daily;&#xD;
      group 8, 600-mg TE plus dutasteride daily. Energy and protein intake, and exercise stimulus&#xD;
      will be standardized. The following outcomes will be measured at baseline and after 20 weeks:&#xD;
      body composition by DEXA scan, deuterium oxide and sodium bromide dilution; thigh muscle&#xD;
      volume by MRI scan; muscle performance by measurements of 1-repetition maximum strength and&#xD;
      leg power; sexual function by International Index of Erectile Function, Sexual Desire&#xD;
      Inventory, and daily logs of sexual activity; and penile erections and rigidity during&#xD;
      EEG-coupled, NPT recoding and in response to a visual erotic stimulus; total and free&#xD;
      testosterone, DHT, estradiol, SHBG, and LH levels. For safety, we will follow&#xD;
      hemoglobin/hematocrit, sleep apnea scores, AST and ALT, PSA, plasma lipids, apolipoproteins,&#xD;
      and lipoprotein particles, and prostate examinations. A multi-disciplinary team of&#xD;
      investigators, the use of a previously validated &quot;Leydig Cell Clamp&quot; model, the use of a&#xD;
      potent inhibitor of both subtypes of 5-alpha reductase enzyme, attention to potential&#xD;
      confounding variables such as energy intake and exercise stimulus, and power and effect size&#xD;
      should help elucidate the role of 5-alpha reduction in mediating androgen action. This study&#xD;
      will enhance our understanding of the biologic role of the steroid 5-alpha-reductase system,&#xD;
      and has immediate clinical relevance in establishing whether selective androgen receptor&#xD;
      modulators that do not undergo 5-alpha reduction would be useful as anabolic agents.&#xD;
