      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if proton beam therapy, with or without&#xD;
      photon beam radiation therapy, is effective in the treatment of skull base chondrosarcoma.&#xD;
      The safety of this treatment will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have skull base chondrosarcoma require complicated treatment because of its&#xD;
      challenging location and nearness to critical structures within the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology will be confirmed prior to discussion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive proton beam&#xD;
      therapy, no sooner than 2 weeks after the last surgery to remove tumor. You will receive&#xD;
      proton beam therapy once a day for about 35 treatments (7 weeks). Treatment will be given for&#xD;
      5 days in a row each week (except for Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) at the Proton Center&#xD;
      in Houston. The whole process should take up to 1 hour each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor feels it is necessary, the proton beam therapy may be combined with standard&#xD;
      photon therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the proton beam, and possibly photon beam, therapy, you will be asked to come in for&#xD;
      study follow-up visits every year, until the study is completed. At these visits, you will&#xD;
      have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, blood draws (less than 1 teaspoon) to monitor&#xD;
      your pituitary function, and neuropsychological testing. For the neuropsychological testing,&#xD;
      you will be interviewed and tested by a neuropsychologist to evaluate your memory, fluency&#xD;
      (the ability to talk and form words) complex thinking ability, planning ability, and&#xD;
      coordination. These tests could last from 1-2 hours. You will also have eye exams performed&#xD;
      by an ophthalmologist from MD Anderson and hearing exams. It is anticipated that it will take&#xD;
      about 5 years to complete this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The proton beam center and its treatment are approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for patient use. A total of up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
