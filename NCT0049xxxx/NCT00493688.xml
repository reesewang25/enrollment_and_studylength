  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To validate a new method for assessing perioperative risk in the cancer patient undergoing&#xD;
      major cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed study researchers will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure preoperative energy reserve capacity (fitness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if postoperative morbidity is a function of perioperative cardiopulmonary gas&#xD;
           exchange metabolism&#xD;

      Participants in this study are already scheduled to have major abdominal or pelvic cancer&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will exercise on a stationary bicycle, while&#xD;
      breathing through a mouthpiece and wearing a nose clip, before your surgery. You will be&#xD;
      asked to pedal at 60 revolutions per minute as the resistance to pedaling gradually&#xD;
      increases. During your pedaling, your vital signs will be monitored using a blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff, electrocardiogram (ECG) leads (to measure the electrical activity of the heart), and a&#xD;
      pulse oximeter. The mouthpiece is used to analyze the inhaled vs the exhaled breaths. The&#xD;
      nose clip is to remind you to breathe through the mouthpiece. This will help researchers&#xD;
      learn the level of oxygen uptake during exercise, before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will stop the test when you become tired. The length of this test will vary from&#xD;
      participant to participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked questions to help rate how well you are able to move physically, based on&#xD;
      two independent forms. These forms will rate your physical status according to 2 scales ( 0&#xD;
      to 4, and 10 to 100, respectively), with high scores meaning less difficulty with physical&#xD;
      movement and lower scores meaning you have more difficulty with physical movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete a brief form asking 12 questions on your ability to perform&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Examples include; Can you take care of yourself? Can you climb a&#xD;
      flight of stairs? You will also be contacted by telephone at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2&#xD;
      years after your surgery and asked the same 12 questions. If we are unable to reach you by&#xD;
      telephone, the questionnaire will be mailed to your home with a return, postage paid envelope&#xD;
      included. It should take about 5 minutes to complete. Once you have completed the 2-year&#xD;
      questionnaire, your participation in this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY. Between 180-200 patients per surgical group will take part&#xD;
      in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
