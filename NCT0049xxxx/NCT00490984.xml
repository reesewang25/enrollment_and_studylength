      The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of tongue&#xD;
      stabilization using Aspire Medical Advance™ System for the treatment of obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA). Success is defined as a statistically significant reduction in AHI measured by&#xD;
      polysomnography (PSG) from baseline to 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major health problem in the United States and can result&#xD;
      in excessive daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular problems. The primary treatment for OSA&#xD;
      today is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Many patients however are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate sleeping with a CPAP machine. Surgery is one of the main treatment options available&#xD;
      today to these CPAP-intolerant patients. However, current methods of sleep surgery are&#xD;
      painful, morbid, and/or lack decent effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will measure the effectiveness of the Advance System, an implantable medical&#xD;
      device to treat OSA. In the trial, patients who meet the study entry criteria receive a&#xD;
      baseline sleep study (PSG). The Advance System is then implanted and 6 months after&#xD;
      implantation, another PSG is performed. The trial will compare the baseline and the 6 month&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea indices&#xD;
