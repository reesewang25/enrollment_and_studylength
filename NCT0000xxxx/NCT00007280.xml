  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at whether a graft of bioengineered skin (BSC), known commercially as&#xD;
      Apligraf, stimulates the healing process in a person's own skin at the edge of a wound (known&#xD;
      as the edge effect). The information from this study will provide a better understanding of&#xD;
      the ways that grafts of bioengineered skin help the healing of chronic wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assign study participants to either the bioengineered skin group or the control&#xD;
      group. People in the control group will receive compression therapy with a multilayered&#xD;
      compression bandage. We will examine each participant before starting treatment and then once&#xD;
      a week for 24 weeks or until the wound heals. On the first day of treatment (day 0) and at&#xD;
      week 3, week 6, and week 24 (end of treatment) we will take a small tissue sample from the&#xD;
      wound for a biopsy. After the wound is completely healed, we will ask the patient to return&#xD;
      once a month for 6 months to make sure the wound stays healed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BSC is a two-layered sheet made from purified beef tendon collagen, living human cells, and a&#xD;
      substance that maintains the cells until they are grafted (removed). We will obtain human&#xD;
      cells from donors unrelated to the patient. The human cells have been tested for the presence&#xD;
      of infectious agents and found to be free of disease-causing organisms such as hepatitis&#xD;
      virus, the AIDS virus, bacteria, and fungi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will randomly assign (randomize) study participants to either the bioengineered skin group&#xD;
      or control group (compression therapy with a multilayered compression bandage). Regardless of&#xD;
      the group to which a patient is assigned, we expect participation in this study for 12 months&#xD;
      following the start of study treatment. We will examine each patient at the screening visit&#xD;
      (2 weeks before randomization) and then again 3-4 days before the start of treatment to make&#xD;
      sure the wound is free of any signs of infection. After the initial randomization visit we&#xD;
      will examine the wound once a week for 24 weeks or until the wound heals, whichever is&#xD;
      earlier. As soon as we have determined that the wound is completely healed, we will ask the&#xD;
      patient to return once a month for 6 months to make sure it remains healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioengineered skin group: We will apply BSC to the wound and cover it with xeroform dressing,&#xD;
      foam bolster, gauze dressing, and compression bandage. If we do not note any improvement at&#xD;
      the week 6 visit, we will apply BSC on the wound a second time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: We will place a multilayered compression bandage on the wound of participants&#xD;
      assigned to this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies (small piece of skin tissue): At day 0 a biopsy will be taken from the thigh and leg&#xD;
      ulcer. The biopsy from the thigh will require sutures and will be removed in ten days.&#xD;
      Sometime between weeks 1 and 3, week 6, week 24 and week 48 (6 month follow-up) visits a&#xD;
      biopsy will be taken from the ulcer (wound) if the ulcer has not healed. If the ulcer is&#xD;
      healed at the week 48 visit, a light scraping of the healed wound will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study examinations: All study examinations will include observation, measurement, and&#xD;
      photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We can only admit women of childbearing age to the study if they are not breast feeding, not&#xD;
      pregnant, or have been surgically sterilized or are using effective birth control. Because&#xD;
      the effects of the proposed treatments on a fetus are unknown, we will remove from the study&#xD;
      any woman who becomes pregnant while receiving BSC applications (day 0-week 3) and suggest&#xD;
      another method of treatment.&#xD;
