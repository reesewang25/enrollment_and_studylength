      To determine by sequential coronary arteriography whether a lipid-lowering diet with and&#xD;
      without lipid-lowering drugs could reverse coronary artery disease in normocholesterolemic&#xD;
      patients. Also, to test whether fish oil supplements could improve human coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Finally, to determine the effect of combination therapy with lipid-reducing&#xD;
      drugs in patients with coronary heart disease and &quot;normal&quot; cholesterol levels. At least three&#xD;
      clinical trials were conducted.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis of patients with coronary heart disease is closely related to the degree of&#xD;
      coronary luminal obstruction. In population studies, the incidence and severity of coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis on angiography is correlated with diet and plasma lipoprotein cholesterol.&#xD;
      Previous clinical trials had shown that treatments that lowered plasma concentrations of low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol benefited some hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary&#xD;
      heart disease. No similar benefit had been demonstrated in normocholesterolemic patients who&#xD;
      make up the majority of patients with coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cholesterol-lowering agent trial, all patients received Step 1 dietary instruction&#xD;
      before randomization and every three months thereafter. Randomization was stratified by&#xD;
      medical or surgical treatment for coronary disease and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol.&#xD;
      A total of 39 patients were assigned to placebo and 40 to active treatment with pravastatin,&#xD;
      nicotinic acid, cholestyramine, and gemfibrozil stepwise as needed to reach the specified&#xD;
      goal (total cholesterol less than or equal to 4.1 mmol/L, ratio of LDL/HDL cholesterol less&#xD;
      than or equal to 2.0). Lipid concentrations were measured every six weeks. Baseline&#xD;
      angiograms were compared to angiograms taken at 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the fish oil trial, 41 patients were randomized to fish oil capsules containing 6 grams of&#xD;
      n-3 fatty acids daily and 39 patients were randomized to olive oil placebo capsules for an&#xD;
      average duration of 28 months. Each fish oil capsule contained 500 mg of n-3 polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids composed of 240 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, 160 mg of docosahexaenoic acid, and&#xD;
      100 mg of mainly docosapentaenoic acid. Randomization was stratified by medical or surgical&#xD;
      treatment for coronary disease and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variable was change in minimal diameter of coronary artery lesions expressed as a continuous&#xD;
      variable. During the initial hospital stay for catheterization, dietary instruction was&#xD;
      provided to every patient according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step&#xD;
      1 guidelines. A seven-day diet record was collected at the randomization visit and every&#xD;
      three months during the trial. Every twelve weeks, a research nurse reviewed with the&#xD;
      patients side effects, diet, and concomitant medications and performed a pill count. Every 24&#xD;
      weeks, the patients received an interval medical history and physical examination by a&#xD;
      physician. A fasting blood sample was obtained for lipid analysis at the 12- and 24-week&#xD;
      visits and every 24 weeks thereafter. If the total cholesterol level of any patient increased&#xD;
      to 250 mg/dl (6.43 mmol/liter) or greater on two consecutive measurements, intensified&#xD;
      dietary instruction was given, followed by drug therapy with cholestyramine or nicotinic acid&#xD;
      or both as needed to lower total cholesterol to less than 250 mg/dl. Twenty-one patients did&#xD;
      not complete the protocol due to death, refusal to undergo the second cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization, development of medical conditions precluding participation, intolerance to&#xD;
      the capsules, and a missing initial angiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the combination therapy trial, patients were randomized to usual care or to stepped-care&#xD;
      drug therapy with lipid-lowering agents including pravastatin, nicotinic acid,&#xD;
      cholestyramine, and gemfibrozil to decrease total cholesterol levels to less than 160 mg/dl&#xD;
      and the ratio of low density lipoprotein cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      to less than 2.0. Measurements included fasting serum lipoprotein profile, fasting&#xD;
      apolipoprotein levels, and frequency of adverse effects. Patients were assessed every six&#xD;
      weeks during drug titration and every three months thereafter for two -and-a-half years.&#xD;
