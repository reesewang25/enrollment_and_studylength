      To evaluate possible early neurogenic influence in essential hypertension by monitoring heart&#xD;
      growth in adolescents over a two year interval.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence has accumulated suggesting that essential hypertension begins early in life and is&#xD;
      potentially preventable. One possible pathogenetic mechanism implicated is a sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system abnormality which is manifested by increased sympathetic drive to the heart.&#xD;
      An elevated sympathetic nervous system tone and decreased vagal inhibition is responsible for&#xD;
      the hyperkinetic circulation seen in a significant proportion of persons with borderline&#xD;
      essential hypertension. Exaggerated blood pressure and heart rate responses to mental&#xD;
      stressors have been documented in normotensive children of hypertensive parents. These&#xD;
      changes appear to involve sympathetic over-responding to fight-flight stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased blood pressure variability induced by stress might accelerate vascular and other&#xD;
      changes leading to essential hypertension. Behavior and environment might chronically elevate&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system tone with damaging cardiovascular consequences. Stressful working&#xD;
      conditions, defective anger management and poor interpersonal problem solving skills have&#xD;
      been implicated in studies of stress-induced blood pressure increases. These influences may&#xD;
      interact with diet and genetic risk to exacerbate pathophysiology. Essential hypertension&#xD;
      risk might be reduced by modifying working and living environments and by training young&#xD;
      persons at risk to cope with or avoid stressors that elicit defensive over-responding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This longitudinal study tested two different models of sympathetic nervous system influence&#xD;
      on the early pathophysiology of essential hypertension. The first neurogenic model was&#xD;
      evaluated by determining whether an excessively variable or reactive blood pressure in year 1&#xD;
      gave rise to excessive heart growth or left ventricular hypertrophy over a two year&#xD;
      follow-up. The second neurogenic model was evaluated by determining if higher blood pressure&#xD;
      exacerbated by personality, stress, and dietary sodium intake led to increased left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ninth-graders entering two large Baltimore high schools in year 1 and year 2 of the study&#xD;
      were screened to yield the 240 subjects in the cohort. Initial screening included data on&#xD;
      blood pressure, height, weight, health habits, personality, medical history, and health care&#xD;
      utilization. Baseline exam included data on basal blood pressure, aerobic exercise stress,&#xD;
      cognitive stress, interpersonal stress, ambulatory blood pressure, echocardiogram, physical&#xD;
      activity, and Type A personality. The parents were also interviewed to assess family blood&#xD;
      pressure status, health history, health care utilization and dietary habits including sodium&#xD;
      intake. Students were re-examined at twelve and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
