    <textblock>
      The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia Trial (TIMI III) focused on unstable angina and&#xD;
      non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. The trial was designed to determine by coronary&#xD;
      arteriography the incidence of coronary thrombi in these conditions and the response of these&#xD;
      thrombi to tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in TIMI IIIA and the effects of&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy and of an early invasive strategy on clinical outcome in TIMI IIIB.&#xD;
      There was also a registry with two components. A roster enumerated all patients with unstable&#xD;
      angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction enrolled at cooperating hospitals. From the&#xD;
      roster, a study population of 1,893 subjects was selected and followed prospectively for the&#xD;
      year to determine incidence of death or myocardial infarction.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIMI IIIA and TIMI IIIB follow the contract-supported clinical trial, Thrombolysis in&#xD;
      Myocardial Infarction (TIMI I, TIMI IIA, and TIMI II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial ischemic syndromes account for a large portion of the annual mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity from all causes in industrialized countries and encompass a wide&#xD;
      clinical-pathologic spectrum. At one end of this spectrum are patients with chronic stable&#xD;
      angina. When studied by coronary arteriography, such patients usually have obstructive&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease with no evidence of fresh thrombosis. At the other end of the&#xD;
      spectrum are patients with acute myocardial infarction who present with a discrete episode of&#xD;
      prolonged chest pain accompanied by persistent ST-segment elevation. Such patients have a&#xD;
      high incidence of thrombotic coronary artery occlusion and the early intravenous&#xD;
      administration of thrombolytic agents has been shown to re-establish perfusion, limit the&#xD;
      extent of left ventricular dysfunction, and reduce both early or in-hospital and late or one&#xD;
      year mortality in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and unstable angina fall between these two&#xD;
      extremes. In the days and weeks following the onset of their disorder, their prognosis for&#xD;
      survival is better than that of patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction but worse than&#xD;
      that of patients with stable angina. Some patients with unstable angina progress to acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, and some of those with non-Q-wave infarction experience an unstable&#xD;
      course with reinfarction. Although others recover from the acute episode without subsequent&#xD;
      infarction or reinfarction, they frequently have severe obstructive coronary artery disease&#xD;
      and may be left with severe chronic stable angina. National summaries of hospital records&#xD;
      indicate that 750,000 patients are hospitalized yearly with unstable angina and 250,000 with&#xD;
      non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the results of creatine kinase measurements and serial electrocardiograms are available,&#xD;
      the identification of patients experiencing non-Q-wave myocardial infarction is relatively&#xD;
      simple. Identification of patients experiencing unstable angina is more difficult, since&#xD;
      numerous definitions of the condition have been offered. There is agreement, however, on two&#xD;
      important features of unstable angina. First, ischemia usually develops at rest or is&#xD;
      precipitated by minimal exertion; this differs from chronic stable angina, in which most&#xD;
      ischemic episodes are precipitated by physical exertion or strong emotion and the resultant&#xD;
      increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Second, ischemia is often associated with transient&#xD;
      ST-segment depression or elevation, in contrast to the persistent ST-segment elevation&#xD;
      characteristic of patients who develop Q-wave infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been observed in small numbers of patients that, unlike patients with chronic stable&#xD;
      ischemia, patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction frequently have a&#xD;
      thrombus in a major coronary artery. Initial conventional therapy for unstable angina&#xD;
      consists of bed rest, oxygen, nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and aspirin. The&#xD;
      use of heparin is widespread but controversial. In many tertiary care hospitals, angiography&#xD;
      followed by PTCA is frequently performed, whereas in community hospitals patients are often&#xD;
      managed without angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the TIMI III trial, patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction were usually&#xD;
      treated in the same way patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction were treated prior to the&#xD;
      advent of thrombolytic therapy. Neither heparin therapy nor thrombolytic therapy was&#xD;
      routinely employed, although knowledge of the role of thrombosis in some patients with this&#xD;
      condition had raised the possibility that one or both approaches might be helpful. Although&#xD;
      the early prognosis was favorable, awareness that the longer-term prognosis was as serious as&#xD;
      that following Q-wave myocardial infarction had led to increasing use of follow-up coronary&#xD;
      angiography to identify patients for whom PTCA or CABG might be useful. Whether or not&#xD;
      revascularization improved prognosis in these patients had not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of thrombolytic therapy for unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial&#xD;
      infarction were limited in number and size. The results suggested a benefit, but the&#xD;
      significance of this benefit and its relation to the risks and costs of therapy remained to&#xD;
      be answered. Also, the value of routine, early coronary angiography followed by PTCA and/or&#xD;
      CABG was still unclear in both these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two clinical trials were initiated simultaneously in different groups of TIMI III&#xD;
      clinical centers. All patients enrolled in the study received standard coronary care unit&#xD;
      care, including bed rest and oxygen. In TIMI IIIA, patients received baseline angiograms and&#xD;
      were randomized in a double-blind manner to t-PA or placebo. All patients then received&#xD;
      intravenous heparin. The primary endpoint was the number of patients with a successful result&#xD;
      of therapy, defined as an improvement in TIMI perfusion by two grades (from 0 to 2 or 3, or&#xD;
      from 1 to 3) or a ten percent reduction in the severity of stenosis. The reduction was based&#xD;
      on a comparison between the baseline angiogram and the follow-up angiogram obtained 18 to 48&#xD;
      hours later. Patients in TIMI IIIA were enrolled over a nine month period. The total duration&#xD;
      was 24 months, including 12 months of data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In TIMI IIIB, a total of 1,473 patients seen within 24 hours of ischemic chest pain at rest,&#xD;
      considered to represent unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (NQMI), were&#xD;
      randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to compare t-PA versus placebo as initial therapy&#xD;
      and an early invasive strategy consisting of early coronary arteriography followed by&#xD;
      revascularization when the anatomy was suitable versus an early conservative strategy&#xD;
      consisting of coronary arteriography followed by revascularization if initial medical therapy&#xD;
      failed. All patients were treated with bed rest, anti-ischemic medications, aspirin, and&#xD;
      heparin. The primary endpoint for the t-PA placebo comparison was death, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, or failure of initial therapy at six weeks. Randomization began in October 1989&#xD;
      and concluded in June 1992. The primary endpoint for the early invasive and early&#xD;
      conservative strategies was death, post randomization myocardial infarction or an&#xD;
      unsatisfactory exercise tolerance test (ETT) at six weeks.&#xD;
