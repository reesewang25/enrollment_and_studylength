  <brief_title>Effectiveness of Anti-HIV Drugs in Patients Who Have Not Received Previous Anti-HIV Drugs During Different Stages of HIV Infection</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare changes in HIV levels and certain immune cells among&#xD;
      patients at different stages of HIV infection. This study will also see how a combination of&#xD;
      stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), indinavir (IDV), and nelfinavir (NFV) affects these&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current findings in anti-HIV drug treatment have led to a greater understanding of the&#xD;
      background of HIV. To find the best anti-HIV treatment to eliminate all HIV viruses, cells&#xD;
      and tissues infected with the HIV virus are examined after combination anti-HIV treatment,&#xD;
      when the level of HIV infection is low. The ERADICATE study will examine the idea that HIV&#xD;
      viruses can be eliminated at any stage of infection over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advancements in antiretroviral therapy have led to a better understanding of the&#xD;
      natural history and immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. To calculate the degree and&#xD;
      duration of antiretroviral effect necessary to eliminate infection, characterization of&#xD;
      residual cellular and tissue HIV reservoirs following high-level viral suppression is&#xD;
      necessary. The ERADICATE study will evaluate the hypothesis that complete viral inhibition is&#xD;
      possible, regardless of HIV disease stage, and leads to HIV eradication from tissues over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are divided into 1 of 5 groups based on the stage of HIV infection. Patients receive&#xD;
      oral stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), indinavir (IDV), and nelfinavir (NFV) twice daily for&#xD;
      24 weeks. All patients undergo basic blood sampling to follow HIV-1 RNA levels and absolute T&#xD;
      cell subset numbers daily for 5 days; then 3 times a week for 3 weeks; 2 times a week for 4&#xD;
      weeks; every 2 weeks for 12 weeks; and monthly thereafter for a total of 3 years. In&#xD;
      addition, the following tissues are sampled at baseline and after 2 weeks and 6 months on&#xD;
      therapy: 1) lymph node; 2) tonsillar; 3) perirectal lymphoid; 4) cerebrospinal fluid; 5) and&#xD;
      semen.&#xD;
