  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers of the blood, sometimes referred to as hematologic malignancies, are disorders of&#xD;
      bone marrow cells that lead to the failure of the normal function of bone marrow and the&#xD;
      uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells in the bone marrow. These cancerous cells can spill&#xD;
      over into the bloodstream and affect other organs causing widespread symptoms. The disease is&#xD;
      life threatening because it blocks the normal function of the marrow, which is to produce red&#xD;
      cells (preventing anemia), white cells (preventing infection), and platelets (preventing&#xD;
      progression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow transplants are a potential form of therapy for patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies. However, BMT is a complicated procedure and can be associated with dangerous&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers are attempting to find ways to reduce the complications of BMT, so&#xD;
      that it would be possible to use it more safely and can be offered more patients. In order to&#xD;
      do this, researchers are developing new techniques to make BMT safer. It requires making&#xD;
      small changes to the standard procedure, which may improve the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental procedures researchers are evaluating are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt;TAB&gt;T-cell depleted peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &lt;TAB&gt; Cyclosporine given immediately after the transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &lt;TAB&gt;Add-back of donor lymphocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing these experimental techniques must be monitored closely to see if any&#xD;
      benefit or harmful effects will occur. Information gathered from this study can be used to&#xD;
      develop further research studies and potential new therapies for hematologic malignancies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bone marrow stem cell transplant studies carried out by the NHLBI BMT Unit have focused on&#xD;
      approaches to optimize the stem cell and lymphocyte dose in order to improve transplant&#xD;
      survival and increase the graft-vs.-leukemia effect. A CD34 stem cell dose of greater than 3&#xD;
      x 10(6)/kg was found to increase survival and reduce relapse, while a CD3+ lymphocyte dose of&#xD;
      less than 1 x 10(5)/kg was associated with a very low incidence of GVHD. Although processing&#xD;
      of 2 peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collections with the CellPro immunoabsorption&#xD;
      method (combined CD34-positive selection and CD2-negative selection) provided an improvement&#xD;
      over previous methods, the system did not always achieve these optimal cell doses. A recent&#xD;
      preclinical evaluation by the Department of Transfusion Medicine of a new immunomagnetic cell&#xD;
      selection system available from Nexell, Inc. has demonstrated improved recovery of CD34+&#xD;
      cells and increased depletion of T lymphocytes, compared to the CellPro method. Incorporation&#xD;
      of the Nexell system (Isolex 300i) into this clinical protocol will allow us to more&#xD;
      consistently achieve CD34+ cell doses above the threshold of 3 x 10(6)/kg and CD3+ lymphocyte&#xD;
      dosing in the region of 0.5 x 10(5)/kg. This will make it possible to test (1) the potential&#xD;
      benefit of optimized transplant cell doses, (2) elimination of post transplant&#xD;
      immunosuppression to enhance immune recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will use the Nexell Isolex 300i system to obtain more data on the&#xD;
      relationship between CD34+ stem cell dose and outcome. In recipients who receive a T cell&#xD;
      dose less than 0.5 x 10(5) CD3+ cells/kg the effect of withdrawing cyclosporine on&#xD;
      development of GVHD will be evaluated in a cohort study: 20 patients will receive low dose&#xD;
      cyclosporine. If the incidence of grade II or worse GVHD is 10% or less, no post transplant&#xD;
      immunosuppression will be given to the next cohort and the incidence and severity of acute&#xD;
      GVHD again assessed. Stopping rules for unacceptable GVHD severity will be applied. Two match&#xD;
      groups HLA 6/6 and 5/6 donor-recipient pairs will be separately studied using this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second phase of the study we will continue to accumulate data on T lymphocyte add-back&#xD;
      given on day 45 and day 100 after transplant. For this phase, cyclosporine will be&#xD;
      reintroduced on day 44 and continued until day 120 to accelerate immune recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 70 patients aged between 10 and 55 years will be studied in each subset (HLA 6/6 and&#xD;
      5/6 matched cohorts). The major endpoint of the study is acute GVHD after transplant. We will&#xD;
      also measure engraftment, acute and chronic GVHD, leukemic relapse, transplant-related and&#xD;
      all causes of mortality, cytomegalovirus reactivation and leukemia-free survival. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for a minimum of 5 years.&#xD;
