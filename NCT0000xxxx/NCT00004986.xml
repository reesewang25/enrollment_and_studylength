  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to treat cryptosporidiosis in&#xD;
      AIDS patients with nitazoxanide.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients take nitazoxanide daily for 8 weeks with a dose escalation after the first 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients return to the hospital for examinations every 2 weeks during the 8-week treatment&#xD;
      period and 6-week follow-up. Nitazoxanide therapy is discontinued in patients showing a&#xD;
      complete clinical and parasitologic response (therapeutic cure) after 8 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      and in patients showing a therapeutic cure at two consecutive visits (Weeks 2 and 4 or Weeks&#xD;
      4 and 6). These patients undergo a physical examination including stool analysis for&#xD;
      Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and routine laboratory tests at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 after&#xD;
      completion of nitazoxanide therapy. Patients who do not show a complete clinical and&#xD;
      parasitologic response (therapeutic failure) after 8 weeks of treatment are allowed to remain&#xD;
      on nitazoxanide therapy through the Open Label Compassionate Use of Nitazoxanide in Treatment&#xD;
      of Cryptosporidiosis in AIDS Patients (UMD-95-009) protocol.&#xD;
