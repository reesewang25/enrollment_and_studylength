    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of micellar paclitaxel for treating&#xD;
      severe psoriasis. Paclitaxel in another formulation (Taxol) is approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration for use in patients with cancer. This drug can decrease growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      and of new blood vessels. Because patients with psoriasis have an increase in skin cell and&#xD;
      blood vessel growth, paclitaxel may also improve their condition. The dose of drug used in&#xD;
      this study is much lower than those used to treat cancer patients and is expected to cause&#xD;
      relatively few side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 to 70 years of age with psoriasis lesions affecting at least 20% of their skin&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a history and physical&#xD;
      examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, and possibly an exercise stress test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive six intravenous (through a vein) infusions of paclitaxel over a&#xD;
      6-month period. Each infusion will take about 2 hours. Patients will stay in the clinic for&#xD;
      observation for at least 1 hour before going home and will return to the clinic for follow-up&#xD;
      examination and tests one week after each infusion. However, on weeks 0 and 8 visit will last&#xD;
      for approximately 8 hours and will require a return to the clinic the following morning.&#xD;
      Blood collection will be performed during the week 0 and 8 visits to determine how fast&#xD;
      Micellar Paclitaxel is eliminated from your body. Approximately 2 teaspoons of blood will be&#xD;
      taken prior to the infusion, twice during the infusion, and eight times during the 22 hours&#xD;
      following the infusion for a total of eleven samples. These return visits will last&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 hours. Patients will have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A skin biopsy (removal of a small tissue sample for microscopic examination) will be&#xD;
           done at the first visit (week 0) and again at weeks 6, 14 and 22. The area of the biopsy&#xD;
           will be numbed with an anesthetic, and a small circle of skin about the width of a&#xD;
           pencil eraser and half as deep will be cut and lifted away. Stitches will be placed and&#xD;
           removed 1 to 2 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A history and physical examination will be done at every visit. Patients will be&#xD;
           interviewed about changes in their skin condition and about treatment side effects and&#xD;
           will be examined by a nurse or physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood and urine samples will be collected at frequent intervals (nearly every visit) to&#xD;
           test for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Photographs of the skin will be taken at the first visit and at several later visits to&#xD;
           document changes in psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A blood sample will be drawn for genetic testing to look for gene changes in people with&#xD;
           psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. An electrocardiogram will be taken at the last visit. This will be done at week 24 and&#xD;
           compared to the screening EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Gonadal toxicity monitoring will be started with all patients entered into the protocol&#xD;
           as of May 2001. Blood will be drawn to measure Inhibit A for females and Inhibit B for&#xD;
           males at weeks 0, 6, 14, and 22.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel is an antiangiogenic chemotherapeutic drug approved by the FDA for use in cancer.&#xD;
      There is anecdotal evidence that some patients with cancer and concomitant psoriasis have&#xD;
      shown improvement in their skin while receiving paclitaxel for cancer. Angiotech&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical, Inc., the company with commercial rights over non-cancer uses of paclitaxel,&#xD;
      has data that suggests paclitaxel demonstrates anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory&#xD;
      properties, in addition to the better known antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects&#xD;
      attributed to this compound. In this pilot open-label single-dose study, we initially treated&#xD;
      patients with severe refractory psoriasis using intravenous Micellar Paclitaxel (75 mg/m(2)&#xD;
      every 4 weeks) for six months. Because this dosing regimen was well tolerated and because the&#xD;
      dosing interval seemed too long, we now propose to treat patients with intravenous Micellar&#xD;
      Paclitaxel at the adjusted dose of 37.5 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks.&#xD;
