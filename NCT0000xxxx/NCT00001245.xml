  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore faster and easier ways to detect infection with the intestinal&#xD;
      parasite Strongyloides stercoralis and learn more about the conditions under which it causes&#xD;
      serious disease. Ordinarily, the Strongyloides helminth (type of intestinal worm) causes only&#xD;
      few, if any, symptoms, but in people with weakened immunity it may be very serious, and even&#xD;
      deadly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 5 and 80 years of age with known or suspected S. stercoralis infection, or&#xD;
      infection with another helminth, such as filariasis, that might cause a cross-reaction with&#xD;
      S. stercoralis may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants found to be infected with S. stercoralis will be treated with ivermectin,&#xD;
      thiabendazole, or albendazole. In addition, they will undergo the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests and stool samples: Samples will be collected before and after treatment to&#xD;
           check general health status and immune function, and to look for parasites in stool. Up&#xD;
           to 50 milliliters (10 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn in adults and up to 25 ml (5&#xD;
           teaspoons) in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin tests: A test similar to those used for tuberculosis and allergies will be&#xD;
           conducted to determine if there is sensitization to products of the parasite. Such a&#xD;
           test might be used as a rapid method to diagnose the infection. About three drops of&#xD;
           several different antigens (proteins) are injected into the skin of the arm. After 15 to&#xD;
           20 minutes, the area is checked to see if a red spot has formed and, if so, the spot is&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is directed to patients with known or suspected Strongyloides stercoralis&#xD;
      infection because it is a relatively common parasitic infection, even in the United States.&#xD;
      It is difficult to diagnose, and efficacy of treatment is difficult to evaluate. Some&#xD;
      infected individuals can develop serious even fatal, disease under certain conditions of&#xD;
      immunosuppression. Because newer diagnostic methods are needed to diagnose this infection, we&#xD;
      have developed new diagnostics that will be evaluated in comparison to more standard&#xD;
      diagnostic tests. Serum and cells will also be collected from patients on this protocol to&#xD;
      understand the cellular and humoral response to the parasite and its antigens. All subjects&#xD;
      proven to have Strongyloides stercoralis infection will be treated with standard therapy and&#xD;
      followed to assess both the efficacy of treatment and the changes in humoral and cellular&#xD;
      immune responses induced by treatment.&#xD;
