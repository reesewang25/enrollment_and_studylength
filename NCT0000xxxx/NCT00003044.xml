      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin and epinephrine administered&#xD;
      directly into the tumor in treating patients who have primary liver cancer that cannot be&#xD;
      removed during surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin-epinephrine injectable gel&#xD;
      (Intradose MPI-5010) in patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open label, two stage, multicenter study. Patients receive intratumoral&#xD;
      treatment with ciplatin-epinephrine (MPI-5010) once weekly, for up to four treatments within&#xD;
      a six week period, followed by an evaluation two weeks after last treatment. Immediately&#xD;
      after the first course, an optional second course of treatment may be undertaken at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator. Patients with a complete response, partial response, and/or&#xD;
      an increase in necrosis of at least 30% of total treated tumor volume will be followed&#xD;
      monthly for up to 6 months. At the completion of 6 months follow up or following&#xD;
      documentation of disease progression or development of new tumors, patients are monitored for&#xD;
      survival in an extended follow up period. All nonresponders at the last 2 week posttreatment&#xD;
      evaluation are entered in the extended follow up and monitored monthly for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 55 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
