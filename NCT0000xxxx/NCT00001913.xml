  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at brain activity while&#xD;
      patients view pictures of people's faces that they are familiar with or have emotional&#xD;
      attachment to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional MRI (fMRI) procedure allows researchers to &quot;see the brain at work.&quot; It uses&#xD;
      the same powerful magnetic fields and weak electromagnetic radiation (radiowaves) as standard&#xD;
      structural MRI. However, functional MRI can also show areas of increased blood flow, which&#xD;
      relates to increased activity by brain cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study builds on previous studies that identified specific areas of the brain&#xD;
      that are activated by visual stimuli showing faces. However, previous research used anonymous&#xD;
      faces as stimuli. This study will use faces of individuals known to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three experiments that will be conducted in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experiment 1 will attempt to determine the effects of familiarity of the photographed&#xD;
           face on brain activity patterns. Patients will view familiar faces, the faces of close&#xD;
           friends and relatives, and the faces of famous people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experiment 2 will look at how maternal attachment affects the response to visual&#xD;
           stimuli. Mothers will view pictures of their first born child, as well as those of&#xD;
           familiar children to whom they are not related, unfamiliar children, and unfamiliar&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Experiment 3 will explore the effects of interpersonal attachment and loss on response&#xD;
           to visual stimuli. In this experiment, bereaved spouses will view pictures of their&#xD;
           deceased spouse, those of living family members, and those of unfamiliar people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol uses a face recognition activation task&#xD;
      to ascertain how brain activation patterns differ depending on the subject's familiarity&#xD;
      with, and emotional attachment to, the person depicted in the visual stimulus. In a series of&#xD;
      studies, subjects will view unfamiliar and familiar (including personally familiar and&#xD;
      famous) faces; mothers will view pictures of their own child and those of familiar and&#xD;
      unfamiliar children; and bereaved and non-bereaved spouses will view pictures of their&#xD;
      spouse, other family members, and unfamiliar people. The use of emotionally significant faces&#xD;
      as activation stimuli may help to elucidate the neural circuitry underlying interpersonal&#xD;
      attachment and psychological responses to loss.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be recruited through advertisements within Bethesda and surrounding&#xD;
        communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects must be right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For experiments #1 and 2, subjects will be 20-40 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For study #3, subjects will be 45-75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For experiment #2, all subjects will be mothers with a non-adopted child aged 6-12 years&#xD;
        old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For experiment #3, subjects in the bereaved group will have become spousally bereaved&#xD;
        within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of significant medical disorders&#xD;
        (including learning disabilities, seizures, history of head trauma, hypertension, or&#xD;
        cerebrovascular disease) or psychiatric disorders, including substance abuse. (An exception&#xD;
        to this is that bereaved subjects in experiment #3 will not be excluded if they meet DSM-IV&#xD;
        criteria for major depressive disorder (non-psychotic), adjustment disorder with depressed&#xD;
        mood, or bereavement, as long as their current Hamilton-D score is less than 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will also be excluded if they take any prescribed medications (including birth&#xD;
        control pills), if they are pregnant, or if their vision is inadequate to see the visual&#xD;
        stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, subjects in experiment #2 will receive a DICA-P (Diagnostic Interview for&#xD;
        Children and Adolescents, Parent Version), and will be excluded if their child meets&#xD;
        diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric illness.&#xD;
