  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients relapse after primary chemotherapy for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they may be&#xD;
      eligible to receive high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support. Unfortunately&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy is curative in less than half the patients who receive it. This study&#xD;
      is being conducted to determine the safety, side effects, and the ability to respond to an&#xD;
      investigational vaccine that consists of tumor-pulsed dendritic cells given with an immune&#xD;
      stimulating drug called interleukin-2. The patient must have a lymphomatous node accessible&#xD;
      for excision to prepare the vaccine. Dendritic cells are immune cells that are obtained from&#xD;
      the blood, and are important in the body's immune response to foreign substances. This study&#xD;
      will examine the response of the immune system after three vaccinations (composed of&#xD;
      dendritic cells, which have been exposed to dead fragments of lymphoma cells) given beginning&#xD;
      three months after transplant. Vaccination may result in sensitizing the patient's dendritic&#xD;
      cells to his lymphoma cells, potentially resulting in an immune response against the&#xD;
      lymphoma. Twelve patients will be treated on study.&#xD;
