      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of live recombinant canarypox ALVAC-HIV vCP205 in&#xD;
      combination with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      at 80 microg and 250 microg. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/30/99: To study the safety of following 4&#xD;
      ALVAC immunizations with a nucleic acid gag/pol HIV-1 immunogen (APL-400-047, Wyeth-Lederle).&#xD;
      To assess the ability of this sequence of immunization to boost the LTL, T-helper cell, and&#xD;
      antibody response.] ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccines have induced HIV-specific CTL responses in&#xD;
      more than half of recipients in some protocols. Depending on the HIV-1 gene products&#xD;
      expressed by the particular ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccine, volunteers have generated&#xD;
      anti-Envelope (vCP125, vCP205, and vCP300), anti-Gag (vCP205 and vCP300), and anti-Nef&#xD;
      (vCP300) CTL activity. Although 3 to 4 immunizations with the different ALVAC-HIV&#xD;
      experimental vaccines induce anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies in a portion, often the&#xD;
      majority, of volunteers, the geometric mean titers of these antibodies are modest, usually&#xD;
      less than 50. This study will determine whether there is an increase in the anti-HIV antibody&#xD;
      titers when GM-CSF is used as an adjuvant with ALVAC-HIV vCP205 and will also examine the&#xD;
      kinetics and magnitude of the HIV-specific CTL response.&#xD;

      HIV-specific CTL response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study volunteers receive ALVAC-HIV&#xD;
      vCP205 at 10^6.3 TCID50 or placebo and GM-CSF or placebo by intramuscular injection at Months&#xD;
      0, 1, 3, and 6 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: vCP205 plus GM-CSF placebo (10 volunteers) Group B: vCP205 plus 80 microg GM-CSF (10&#xD;
      volunteers) Group C: vCP205 plus 250 microg GM-CSF (10 volunteers) Group D: vcP205 placebo&#xD;
      plus GM-CSF placebo (6 volunteers). [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/30/99: Boosting with APL-400-047&#xD;
      HIV-1 gag/pol DNA is added for volunteers who have received all scheduled immunization in the&#xD;
      original protocol. Volunteers in Groups A, B, and C will receive booster intramuscular&#xD;
      injections of DNA vaccine at Months 0 and 1, those in Group D will receive DNA control&#xD;
      (bupivacaine carrier alone) at Months 0 and 1].&#xD;
