    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of the experimental anticancer drug oxaliplatin. It is designed to&#xD;
      establish the maximum dose of the drug that can be given safely to patients with cancer who&#xD;
      have impaired liver function and to determine the drug's side effects. It will also examine&#xD;
      how liver function affects the drug's elimination from the body. The liver plays an important&#xD;
      role in the elimination of many anticancer drugs, and patients with impaired liver function&#xD;
      should not take certain drugs or should take them in reduced doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with cancer that has metastasized (spread from the&#xD;
      original tumor site) and for whom standard treatment is not available or is no longer&#xD;
      effective may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with various tests and&#xD;
      procedures that may include physical examination, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans, chest X-rays, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given oxaliplatin in doses determined according to their level of liver&#xD;
      function. Patients may have normal liver function or mildly, moderately or severely impaired&#xD;
      liver function, or may have had a liver transplant. Oxaliplatin will be infused intravenously&#xD;
      (through a vein) over two hours on the first day of 21-day treatment cycles-that is, once&#xD;
      every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue as long as the cancer is under control and side&#xD;
      effects do not require stopping the drug. Urine will be collected over 48 hours after the&#xD;
      infusion to determine how much of the drug is eliminated in urine. Blood tests will be done&#xD;
      to monitor safety of the treatment, and imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT and MRI scans,&#xD;
      will be done periodically to evaluate the tumor's response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special blood tests will also be done to study how oxaliplatin is eliminated from the body.&#xD;
      With the first dose of the drug, blood samples will be collected just before the infusion&#xD;
      begins, just before it ends, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after&#xD;
      the infusion, and again 1 week and 3 weeks later. Additional blood samples may be collected&#xD;
      at the third treatment cycle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin is a diaminocyclohexane platinum derivative with known anticancer activity in&#xD;
      solid tumors. The recommended single-agent dose of oxaliplatin in adult cancer patients is&#xD;
      130 mg/m(2) given intravenously over 2 hours every 3 weeks. Hepatic metabolism is the major&#xD;
      route of drug elimination for many anti-cancer agents. Although there is limited safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data for oxaliplatin in patients with renal impairment, there is currently no&#xD;
      data regarding its disposition in patients with liver dysfunction. This phase I and&#xD;
      pharmacologic study of a single agent oxaliplatin is being conducted in adult cancer patients&#xD;
      with advanced malignancies and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratified into five groups based upon their degree of liver dysfunction as assessed by liver&#xD;
      function tests. Group A will consist of patients with normal hepatic function to serve as&#xD;
      pharmacologic controls. Group E will consist of patients who have received a liver&#xD;
      transplant. The remaining 3 groups will start at different doses of oxaliplatin based on&#xD;
      hepatic dysfunction and dose escalation in these groups will proceed in a manner in&#xD;
      accordance with standard phase I trial with 3 patients per dose level until dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity is observed. Pharmacokinetic monitoring will be performed in all patients on study.&#xD;
      The goals of this trial are to define the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of single agent&#xD;
      oxaliplatin in this patient population and to determine recommended doses of oxaliplatin in&#xD;
      patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment.&#xD;
