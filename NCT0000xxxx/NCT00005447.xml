      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term follow-up and data analysis of two epidemiologic studies, a general population&#xD;
      study and a clinical trial provided the basis for the study. The first study assessed the&#xD;
      long-term relationship between total physical activity (both during work and leisure time)&#xD;
      and mortality in a random sample of 1,656 Black and white men and women residents of the City&#xD;
      of Buffalo, New York. The study focused on participants (30+ years of age at baseline) of the&#xD;
      Buffalo Health Study, an epidemiological investigation conducted in Buffalo in 1960. As part&#xD;
      of the investigation, detailed information was gathered from participants with regard to a&#xD;
      number of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics (age, body mass index, education,&#xD;
      marital status, etc.) and the participants' usual daily activities (both during a weekday and&#xD;
      weekend) at work and outside work. This information was used to compute a total physical&#xD;
      activity index. The study related the participants' physical activity characteristics to&#xD;
      their all-cause and CHD mortality experience throughout the follow-up period and tested&#xD;
      whether or not the relationship between physical activity and mortality was similar across&#xD;
      gender and race. The detailed baseline demographic and socioeconomic data allowed analysis of&#xD;
      the independence of any observed association between physical activity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second study extended to 17 years, the follow-up of the National Exercise and Heart&#xD;
      Disease Project (NEHDP), a multi-center, randomized clinical trial designed to study the&#xD;
      effects of a regular, medically prescribed and supervised exercise program on the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of male survivors (ages 30-64 at baseline) of a myocardial infarction (MI).&#xD;
      Three year findings from the trial reported non-significant differences between the treatment&#xD;
      and control groups for all-cause mortality, and recurrent MI in favor of the exercise group.&#xD;
      Other outcomes favoring the treatment group were reported after one year and included&#xD;
      increased physical working capacity, and decreased body fat, diastolic blood pressure, and&#xD;
      triglycerides. The study determined vital status for all original study participants, and&#xD;
      cause of death in the deceased. The longer follow-up permitted analysis of whether the&#xD;
      long-term survival of the treatment group differed from that of the controls. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators were able to assess if the risk factor changes observed in the first year&#xD;
      of the trial were present after three years, whether these changes were related to long-term&#xD;
      survival, whether differences in mortality observed in sub-groups (i.e. smokers) after three&#xD;
      years remained after 17 years, and whether baseline patient characteristics (i.e., anxiety&#xD;
      and depression) predicted mortality.&#xD;
