  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the blood levels of amprenavir (APV) alone, APV&#xD;
      combined with efavirenz (EFV), and APV/EFV combined with a third drug (nelfinavir [NFV],&#xD;
      indinavir [IDV], ritonavir soft gel capsules [RTV sgc], or saquinavir soft gel capsules [SQV&#xD;
      sgc]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-HIV therapy with 3 or 4 drugs is currently the recommended approach for treating HIV&#xD;
      infections. Doctors need to know the best dosages of certain drugs when they are given in&#xD;
      combination. This study will measure the blood levels of APV alone, APV combined with EFV,&#xD;
      and APV/EFV plus a second PI in healthy volunteers. It will study the safety and tolerance of&#xD;
      these drugs.&#xD;

      Triple-drug antiretroviral regimens have become the recommended approach to therapy for HIV&#xD;
      infection. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00: The clinical use of multiple-drug antiretroviral&#xD;
      regimens containing various combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
      (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors&#xD;
      (PIs) has become a widespread approach to therapy for HIV infection, especially for patients&#xD;
      previously treated with PIs.] Since the introduction of PIs, a greater awareness of the&#xD;
      relationship between optimal suppression of viral replication, genotypic resistance, and&#xD;
      viral rebound has led to the design of more potent antiretroviral drug combinations. Two ACTG&#xD;
      clinical trials addressing the issue of virologic failure utilize antiviral regimens that&#xD;
      include 2 NRTIs, 2 PIs (one of which is APV), and EFV (NNRTI). Although this drug combination&#xD;
      is logical, there is limited PK data to guide the dosing selection. This study enrolls&#xD;
      healthy volunteers to obtain PK profiles and metabolic assessments of APV/EFV before and&#xD;
      after the addition of a second PI [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00: APV alone, APV combined with&#xD;
      EFV, and APV/EFV combined with a second PI].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon study entry, volunteers receive APV plus EFV for 2 weeks. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00:&#xD;
      Volunteers receive a single dose of APV alone on Day 0, EFV alone on Days 1 to 10, and APV&#xD;
      combined with EFV on Days 11 to 13.] After 2 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00: After&#xD;
      completion of the second PK visit], volunteers are randomized to 1 of 5 treatment arms to add&#xD;
      a second PI to the APV/EFV drug combination for 2 more weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00: for&#xD;
      at least 1 week]. The treatment arms are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (control arm): APV and EFV alone. Arm B: APV and EFV plus IDV [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      12/4/00: APV and EFV plus NFV]. Arm C: APV and EFV plus NFV [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00: APV&#xD;
      and EFV plus IDV]. Arm D: APV and EFV plus RTV sgc. Arm E: APV and EFV plus SQV sgc. On Day&#xD;
      14, 15, or 16, volunteers return to the clinic for PK testing following the dual-drug&#xD;
      regimen, and again on Day 29, 30, or 31 following the triple-drug regimen (or continued&#xD;
      dual-drug regimen for Arm A). [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00: Volunteers attend clinics for PK&#xD;
      testing on Days 0 and 1 (first visit), after taking the dual-drug regimen for at least 3 days&#xD;
      (second visit, e.g., on Day 14 or after), and after taking the triple-drug regimen (or, if in&#xD;
      Arm A, after continuing on the dual-drug regimen) for at least 7 days (third visit).] Before&#xD;
      each PK testing, volunteers complete an Adherence Questionnaire. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00:&#xD;
      The Adherence Questionnaire is administered at the second and third PK visits.] Volunteers&#xD;
      maintain a food diary. Two to three weeks after completing the drug regimen [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      12/4/00: Within 2-3 weeks after the third PK visit], volunteers return to the clinic for&#xD;
      evaluations and urine and blood sampling.&#xD;
