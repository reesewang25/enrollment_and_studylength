      To measure associations of established and suspected coronary heart disease risk factors with&#xD;
      both atherosclerosis and new coronary heart disease events in representative cohorts from&#xD;
      four diverse United States communities. To compare the communities with respect to risk&#xD;
      factors, medical care, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease incidence. ARIC has two&#xD;
      components in each community: study of representative cohorts of adult men and women, and&#xD;
      community surveillance of morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is now firmly established that coronary heart disease mortality rates in the&#xD;
      United States have fallen by about 50 percent since the mid 1960's, there has been no&#xD;
      systematic program to study in parallel coronary heart disease morbidity and the prevalence&#xD;
      of atherosclerosis. Such information is essential for an understanding of the factors&#xD;
      influencing the time trends, for quantifying the effects of prevention versus treatment, and&#xD;
      for guiding future policy in research and services. It remains a possibility that the&#xD;
      mortality decline in past years was not accompanied by a reduction in incidence, or a&#xD;
      diminution in the extent of the underlying arterial diseases. A trend confined to mortality&#xD;
      would require different explanations and call for different strategies of prevention than a&#xD;
      decline encompassing the whole spectrum of clinical manifestations, which would favor a risk&#xD;
      factor explanation. ARIC surveillance provides cardiovascular incidence rates, and its&#xD;
      cohorts provide information on atherosclerosis, cardiovascular symptoms, new and established&#xD;
      risk factors and medical care utilization on representative residents of each community. New&#xD;
      predictors of both atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases are investigated using data&#xD;
      obtained at four examination centers, the ultrasound center and five central laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1978 Conference on the Decline in Coronary Heart Disease Mortality and the 1979 Working&#xD;
      Group on Heart Disease Epidemiology both recommended a community surveillance program. As a&#xD;
      result, in 1980 the Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee and the National&#xD;
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council approved Phase I of the surveillance pilot study.&#xD;
      Phase II of the pilot study and the full-scale study was approved by the Clinical&#xD;
      Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee in May 1982. The Requests for Proposals for&#xD;
      ARIC were released in September 1984 and awards made in 1985.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARIC is a large-scale, long-term program that measures associations of established and&#xD;
      suspected CHD risk factors with both atherosclerosis and new CHD events in men and women from&#xD;
      four diverse communities. The project has two components: community surveillance of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, and repeated examinations of a representative cohort of men and women in each&#xD;
      community. The representative cohorts include 4,000 persons from each community. Three of&#xD;
      these reflect the ethnic composition of the communities in which they live; one cohort is&#xD;
      black. The community surveillance involves abstracting hospital records and death&#xD;
      certificates and investigating out-of-hospital deaths for hospitalized myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and CHD death in 800,000 men and women in these four communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cohort participants were examined four times (1987-90, and 1990-93, 1993-96, and&#xD;
      1996-99), and were contacted annually to update their medical histories. Atherosclerosis was&#xD;
      measured by carotid ultrasonography. Arteriosclerosis was measured using retinal photography.&#xD;
      Cerebrovascular disease was assessed using MRI in a sample of black and white participants.&#xD;
      Risk factors studied include: blood lipids, lipoprotein cholesterols, and apolipoproteins;&#xD;
      plasma hemostatic factors; blood chemistries and hematology and indicators of infectious and&#xD;
      inflammatory disease; DNA markers of these risk factors, sitting, supine and standing blood&#xD;
      pressures; anthropometry; fasting blood glucose and insulin levels; ECG findings; heart rate&#xD;
      variability; cigarette and alcohol use; physical activity levels; dietary aspects; and family&#xD;
      history. Novel factors are tested using nested case-control studies on stored blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth and final examination, which included a complete periodontal examination with&#xD;
      measures of inflammatory markers was completed in 1999, with a return rate of 86%. Community&#xD;
      surveillance currently provides complete age, race, and sex-specific rates of hospitalization&#xD;
      for myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death in the communities for 1987-1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been extended through January, 2007 to continue to follow the cohort through&#xD;
      annual telephone calls and hospital surveillance to identify incident cardiovascular events&#xD;
      through 19 years. Community surveillance continues to identify trends in cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease incidence, case-fatality, and mortality in 35-74 year olds over a 19 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diverse communities can be compared with respect to CHD incidence and medical care and,&#xD;
      through the cohort component, with respect to risk factors and peripheral atherosclerosis.&#xD;
      The results will provide a measure of the variation in the distribution and determinants of&#xD;
      CHD in the U.S. and, within the limits of ecologic analysis, suggest possible reasons for&#xD;
      observed differences.&#xD;
