      To develop and test interventions to prevent obesity by decreasing weight gain during the&#xD;
      high-risk transitional period from pre-puberty to puberty in African-American girls who are&#xD;
      at high risk for developing obesity.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high prevalence of obesity in Black women may be a contributing factor to their higher&#xD;
      mortality from cardiovascular disease and higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension&#xD;
      compared with white and Hispanic women. Although Hispanic women also exhibit high prevalence&#xD;
      of obesity, mortality from heart disease is less than for Black or white women and mortality&#xD;
      from diabetes is less than for Black women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased prevalence of obesity in Black females is present during childhood, and the&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity is increasing faster in Black girls than in white girls. Recent data&#xD;
      from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) showed that&#xD;
      during preadolescence, age 6-11 years, 30.7 percent of Black girls, compared with 22.0&#xD;
      percent of white girls, were overweight. Furthermore, over the past 30 years the prevalence&#xD;
      of obesity in this preadolescent age group has increased 150 percent in Black girls compared&#xD;
      with 40 percent in white girls. The prevalence of obesity in the adolescent age of 12 to 17&#xD;
      years is similarly high, at 29.9 percent in Black girls compared with 20.7 percent in white&#xD;
      girls. The 35 percent increase in obesity over the past 30 years is similar in the&#xD;
      preadolescent and adolescent age groups for white girls, but for Black girls the increase is&#xD;
      greater in the younger age group (150 percent more prevalent) than in the older age group (80&#xD;
      percent increase) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) on Intervention Studies in Children and Adolescents to&#xD;
      Prevent Cardiovascular Disease was convened in September 1997 to review the efficacy and&#xD;
      effectiveness of interventions to prevent and improve known cardiovascular disease risk&#xD;
      factors in children and adolescents and to develop recommendations for future preventive&#xD;
      intervention studies. The initiative was developed in response to recommendations of the SEP.&#xD;
      The RFA was released in April 1998.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Girl's health Enrichment Multi-site Studies (GEMS) is a collection of studies designed to&#xD;
      develop and test interventions to prevent excessive weight gain by African-American girls as&#xD;
      they enter and proceed through puberty. The research is being conducted as four&#xD;
      inter-dependent, clinical trials. They are &quot;inter-dependent&quot; in the sense that they are&#xD;
      considering similar study populations, following similar follow-up schedules and use a &quot;core&quot;&#xD;
      set of evaluation procedures. Nonetheless, GEMS is not a &quot;multi-center clinical trial&quot; in the&#xD;
      usual sense - each field center is evaluating its own intervention (and corresponding&#xD;
      control). As a result, each study will have high internal validity and will be designed and&#xD;
      analyzed as a study in its own right.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I, several distinct and separate interventions were developed. Interventions&#xD;
      addressed diet, physical activity, and psychosocial and familial influences. There were four&#xD;
      participating centers in Phase I, including the University of Memphis, Stanford University,&#xD;
      the University of Minnesota, and Baylor College of Medicine. The coordinating center was&#xD;
      located at George Washington University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, individual clinical trials will be supported to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      interventions developed in Phase I. Although the interventions developed by each field center&#xD;
      will be unique, the centers will collaborate to standardize key measurements, outcomes, and&#xD;
      main analysis methods. The Memphis Field Center will conduct a full-scale two year,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled clinical trial for weight gain prevention among 300 high risk,&#xD;
      preadolescent African American girls and their parents. Body mass index is the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. Secondary endpoints include dietary intake, physical activity, and psychosocial&#xD;
      variables. The Stanford Field Center will conduct a two-arm parallel group, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to test the efficacy of an after school dance program and a family-based&#xD;
      intervention to reduce television, videotape, and video game use to reduce weight gain among&#xD;
      260 African American preadolescent girls. An active placebo group will receive an&#xD;
      information-based community health education intervention. Interventions will last for two&#xD;
      years. Body mass index is the primary outcome measure.&#xD;
