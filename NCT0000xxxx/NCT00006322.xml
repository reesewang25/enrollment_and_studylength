      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United&#xD;
      States. On the basis of an interplay of genetic and environmental factors, these diseases&#xD;
      appear to be rooted in childhood. Recent reports implicate the intrauterine nutritional&#xD;
      environment regulating fetal growth as a determinant of adult cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      According to this concept, impaired fetal growth, with consequent lower birth weight, results&#xD;
      in alteration in organ structure and subsequent functional impairment in later life. Higher&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) has been suggested as the possible link between compromised intrauterine&#xD;
      growth and the long-term risk for cardiovascular disease. Despite the many reports which&#xD;
      appear to support the low birth weight - high BP hypothesis, this concept is in conflict with&#xD;
      the body of data on the association of BP with body size in childhood, adolescence, and&#xD;
      adulthood which consistently demonstrates a direct relationship between body weight and BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this prospective study contributed an objective body of data to this important&#xD;
      issue. If birth measures reflecting intrauterine exposure do contribute significantly to BP&#xD;
      in later childhood, then studies focused on the mechanisms regulating this risk are&#xD;
      justified. Alternatively, if post-natal/childhood parameters are the major determinants of&#xD;
      later BP, then efforts should focus on effective preventive strategies in childhood, such as&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the low birth weight - high blood pressure concept, the investigators conducted a&#xD;
      prospective study on a cohort of children who were well characterized at birth. In 1988, data&#xD;
      on weight, length, BP, gestation and maternal health were obtained on 1,160 newborn cases&#xD;
      representing a range of birth weight and gestational age. They re-examined these children at&#xD;
      age 11-13 years to test the overall hypothesis that birth weight, as well as other newborn&#xD;
      measures of intrauterine growth, did not correlate with BP at age 11-13 years. The aims of&#xD;
      the project were to: 1) determine if birth weight contributed to BP and/or body size in&#xD;
      childhood; 2) determine if the duration of intrauterine growth in terms of gestational age&#xD;
      contributed to BP and body size; 3) determine if newborn ponderal index, a measure of&#xD;
      relative fetal growth, contributed to BP and body size; and 4) determine the relative&#xD;
      contribution of newborn measures of birth weight, gestational age, BP, ponderal index, and&#xD;
      maternal health to BP and body size in late childhood.&#xD;
