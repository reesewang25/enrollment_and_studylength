  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis can be caused by an infection with a&#xD;
      virus, but poisonous (toxic) substances can also cause it. Researchers have identified&#xD;
      several of the viruses responsible for hepatitis, however some patients with hepatitis show&#xD;
      no evidence of being infected with known hepatitis viruses. Researchers call conditions like&#xD;
      this, seronegative hepatitis. It means that a patient has hepatitis but he/she does not have&#xD;
      evidence in their blood of a viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seronegative hepatitis is often complicated by autoimmune disorders and associated severe&#xD;
      disorders especially, fulminant hepatitis of childhood and post-hepatitis aplastic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have attempted to identify the cause of these conditions but have been&#xD;
      unsuccessful. Therefore, this study was developed to collect blood and stool samples from&#xD;
      patients with seronegative hepatitis in order to help identify the virus responsible.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While several viruses have been identified as agents of liver inflammation, some proportion&#xD;
      of cases of acute hepatitis are seronegative and show no evidence of prior infection with&#xD;
      known hepatitis viruses A, B, C, or E. Seronegative acute hepatitis is often complicated by&#xD;
      autoimmune phenomena or late severe consequences, especially fulminant hepatitis of childhood&#xD;
      and post-hepatitis aplastic anemia. Efforts in the Hematology Branch to identify an&#xD;
      infectious agent in these latter two syndromes have been unsuccessful, probably because they&#xD;
      are immune-mediated and also accompanied by massive tissue destruction. We now propose&#xD;
      systematic collection of blood and fecal samples from patients with seronegative acute&#xD;
      hepatitis for purposes of virus identification research. Samples will be collected from&#xD;
      patients in United States Army clinics; patient identifiers will be employed.&#xD;
