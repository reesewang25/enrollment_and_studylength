  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a condition characterized by a decreased&#xD;
      attention span, hyperactivity, and/or impulsiveness inappropriate for a certain age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, young children have what are known as subtle neurological signs. These are&#xD;
      involuntary movements of one part of the body that occur while the child is making a&#xD;
      voluntary movement of another part of the body. This is referred to as synkinesis, or&#xD;
      overflow movements. These overflow movements disappear during normal development and are&#xD;
      usually gone by the age of 10. However, in children with ADHD these overflow movements tend&#xD;
      to be more intense and last long after the age of 10. This leads researchers to believe there&#xD;
      is an abnormality in the maturation and development of the brain areas associated with motor&#xD;
      activity in children with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that gives information&#xD;
      about brain function. It is very useful when studying areas of the nervous system related to&#xD;
      motor activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum). A magnetic signal&#xD;
      given from a special instrument held close to the patient's head stimulates a small area of&#xD;
      the brain that controls a few muscles (for example, the muscles that control one finger).&#xD;
      Doctors put electrodes (small pieces of metal taped to areas of the body) over the muscle to&#xD;
      measure the electrical activity the muscle produces when it makes a movement. When the&#xD;
      magnetic signal activates those muscles the electrodes pick up and record the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the movement that the muscles make in response to the magnetic signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will study normal children and those diagnosed with ADHD using TMS to find out if&#xD;
      the clinical abnormalities of ADHD are associated with a delay or abnormality in maturation&#xD;
      of areas of the nervous system responsible for motor activity (motor cortex and corticospinal&#xD;
      tract).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subtle neurological signs (synkinesis and mirror movements) are present in normal children up&#xD;
      until 9 or 10 years of age. In addition, speed of repetitive and sequential movements&#xD;
      increases from 5 to 8 years of age at which time children perform these movements at close to&#xD;
      adult speeds. Based on clinical studies of both normal children and of children with&#xD;
      corticospinal tract lesions, it has been postulated that these subtle motor signs reflect&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental immaturity of the intracortical and interhemispheric inhibitory systems&#xD;
      and that their disappearance occurs as a result of maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of subtle neurological signs can accurately distinguish children with&#xD;
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from healthy controls. The increased&#xD;
      intensity of these neurological signs in younger age groups and their persistence beyond the&#xD;
      age of 9 years suggest that children with ADHD may have delayed or abnormal neuromaturational&#xD;
      development; in particular, development of the inhibitory systems of the motor cortex. This&#xD;
      is in concert with the theories of cognitive abnormalities seen in these children where&#xD;
      behavioral studies indicate that children with ADHD have most difficulty in executive&#xD;
      function tests that look specifically at motor inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool which gives information about&#xD;
      cortical function. It is particularly useful in the study of the motor cortex and its&#xD;
      connections via the corticospinal tract and the corpus callosum. A single suprathreshold&#xD;
      stimulus to the motor cortex produces a motor evoked potential (MEP) and inhibition of&#xD;
      ongoing muscle activity in ipsilateral and contralateral target muscles. TMS studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated differences in both the velocity of central motor conduction, and the ability to&#xD;
      evoke motor inhibition when comparing adults with children under 10 years of age. These&#xD;
      differences suggest that cortical inhibitory and facilitatory systems undergo normal&#xD;
      developmental changes during the first decade of life, and that they may form the neural&#xD;
      substrate for the clinical developmental changes that occur in children during this same&#xD;
      period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study children with ADHD with single and paired pulse TMS to determine if the&#xD;
      clinical abnormalities present in these children reflect an underlying delay or abnormality&#xD;
      in maturation of the inhibitory and facilitatory systems of the cortex and corticospinal&#xD;
      tracts. If present, these findings would give objective evidence of abnormal inhibitory&#xD;
      systems in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; their presence (or absence) may&#xD;
      differentiate between the different subtypes of ADHD. Since stimulants have an ameliorative&#xD;
      effect on the neuropsychological functioning in these children, future studies would be able&#xD;
      to determine whether they have a similar effect on the motor system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS is associated with a click which can have a 120 dB peak sound level at maximum stimulator&#xD;
      output. Studies in adults and children have shown no long-lasting or permanent hearing loss&#xD;
      after TMS, but there is no information regarding transient decrease in hearing thresholds&#xD;
      immediately after TMS as can occur after listening to music through headphones using personal&#xD;
      cassette recorders. As part of the main study, we will be conducting a safety study to&#xD;
      determine the risk for temporary hearing loss after TMS in children.&#xD;
