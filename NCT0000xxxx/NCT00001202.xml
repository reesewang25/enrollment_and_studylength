  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a continuation of two previous studies conducted at the NIH. The first study ,&#xD;
      &quot;Treatment of True Precocious Puberty with a Long-Acting Lutenizing Hormone Releasing Hormone&#xD;
      Analog (D-Trp(6)-Pro(9)-Net-LHRH)&quot; had less than optimal results. Some patients, all of whom&#xD;
      were diagnosed with familial isosexual precocious puberty, had an inadequate response to the&#xD;
      medication and were observed to have high levels of testosterone, advanced bone aging, and&#xD;
      other complications of the disease. As a result these patients were enrolled in a second&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second study, &quot;Spironolactone Treatment for Boys with Familial Isosexual Precocious&#xD;
      Puberty&quot;, - the patients received another medication, spironolactone (Aldactone). The drug&#xD;
      blocked the effects of testosterone, -but bone age advancement did not improve. Some patients&#xD;
      began experiencing gynecomastia (an abnormal growth of the male breasts). Researchers believe&#xD;
      these may be the effects of elevated levels of estrodiol (a form of the female hormone,&#xD;
      estrogen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, testolactone is added to the drug regimen to block the production of&#xD;
      estrogen. The study therefore uses spironolactone to prevent the action of the male hormones&#xD;
      (androgen) and testolactone to block the production of female hormones (estrogen).&#xD;
      Deslorelin, an LHRH analog which works by turning off true (central) puberty, is added to the&#xD;
      drug regimen once true puberty begins. This is because it is know that boys with familial&#xD;
      male precocious puberty go into true puberty too early (despite treatment with spironolactone&#xD;
      and testolactone), and when that happens, the spironolactone and testolactone are no longer&#xD;
      as effective. The goal of the treatment is to delay sexual development until a more&#xD;
      appropriate age and prevent short adult stature (height).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most males with precocious puberty who have been referred to NIH have been successfully&#xD;
      treated under protocol 79-CH-0112 &quot;Treatment of True Precocious Puberty with a Long-Acting&#xD;
      Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone Analog (D-Trp6-Pro9-Net-LHRH).&quot; A subset of these&#xD;
      patients, however, all of whom had familial male isosexual precocity, had an inadequate&#xD;
      response to LHRH analog as demonstrated by high serum testosterone levels, rapid advancement&#xD;
      in bone age, testicular growth, sperm production, and lack of regression of secondary sex&#xD;
      characteristics. These patients had low baseline gonadotropin levels and lacked a pubertal&#xD;
      response to LHRH, whereas the patients who had responded to LHRH analog all had clear&#xD;
      evidence of central precocious puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative approach to treatment, the patients with familial male precocious puberty&#xD;
      were enrolled in protocol 83-CH-0028, &quot;Spironolactone Treatment of Boys with Familial&#xD;
      Isosexual Precocious Puberty&quot;. Spironolactone (Aldactone) is an antiandrogen that also&#xD;
      reduced testosterone synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme 17-hydroxylase. This treatment&#xD;
      decreased the plasma testosterone level and inhibited the peripheral effect of testosterone&#xD;
      on target tissues. This was apparent through a decrease in acne and in the frequency of&#xD;
      spontaneous erections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone age advancement, however, was not slowed by spironolactone and gynecomastia had begun to&#xD;
      occur in a number of patients. Both of these processes may be the result of persisting&#xD;
      elevated estradiol levels. To attempt to reduce elevated estrogen levels in these patients to&#xD;
      normal prepubertal levels, we plan to use testolactone (Teslac) to inhibit aromatase, the&#xD;
      last step of estrogen biosynthesis. Testolactone has previously been used for a similar&#xD;
      purpose in girls with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (McCune-Albright Syndrome)&#xD;
      under protocol 82-CH-0165, &quot;Testolactone treatment of girls with LHRH analog-resistant&#xD;
      precocious puberty due to autonomous non-neoplastic ovarian estrogen secretion.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to administer combined spironolactone and testolactone treatment-spironolactone to&#xD;
      inhibit the action of androgen, and testolactone to block the formation of estrogen. The goal&#xD;
      of this treatment is to delay sexual maturation and to prevent early closure of the epiphyses&#xD;
      and adult short stature. These goals are being partially met with spironolactone and we&#xD;
      postulate that the addition of testolactone will improve response by slowing bone growth and&#xD;
      preventing gynecomastia. Preliminary results using this regimen demonstrate that blockade of&#xD;
      both androgen action and estrogen synthesis is an effective treatment for familial male&#xD;
      precocious puberty. Throughout the therapy, patients will receive frequent clinical,&#xD;
      hormonal, and toxicological monitoring.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with familial male precocious puberty will be admitted to the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible for the study, the following criteria will be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Boys 10 years of age or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tanner II to IV pubertal development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unfused epiphyses by bone films.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence that precocious puberty is not secondary to another recognized cause of&#xD;
        pseudopuberty:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. We will exclude congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and document pretreatment androgen&#xD;
             levels, by a 1-hour ACTH test, which will include measurement of 11-deoxycortisol and&#xD;
             17-OH-progesterone at 0 and 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. We will exclude tumor of adrenal or testes by physical exam, ultrasound, and&#xD;
             measurement of adrenal androgens (DHA, DHAS, androstenedione).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Elevated testosterone levels measured at 10 am, 2pm, 10 pm and 2 am over a 24 hour period.&#xD;
