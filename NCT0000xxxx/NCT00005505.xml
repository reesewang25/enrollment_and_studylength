      To investigate the contributions of neighborhood environments to the distribution of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk across different age ranges and racial/ethnic groups, using&#xD;
      data from three ongoing cohort studies of cardiovascular disease: the Coronary Artery Disease&#xD;
      Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities&#xD;
      (ARIC) Study, and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is abundant evidence of persistent differences in cardiovascular disease morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality by socioeconomic status (SES). The determinants of SES-related differences in CVD&#xD;
      outcomes and risk factors have not been fully established. Previous work in this area has&#xD;
      focused predominantly on individual-level SES indicators, but recently attention has shifted&#xD;
      to the role of neighborhood or community-level variables in shaping health outcomes,&#xD;
      independently of individual-level SES. Several epidemiologic studies have suggested that&#xD;
      neighborhood characteristics may influence the distribution of disease risk, but the role of&#xD;
      both neighborhood-level and individual level SES variables in shaping individual-level&#xD;
      outcomes and risk factors has been rarely addressed in epidemiologic studies of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations of neighborhood socioenvironmental characteristics with CVD prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence in middle-aged and elderly populations were investigated using data from the ARIC&#xD;
      Study and CHS. Associations of neighborhood socioenvironmental characteristics with CVD risk&#xD;
      factors and risk factor trends in young and middle-aged adults were investigated using data&#xD;
      from the CARDIA and ARIC studies. CARDIA and ARIC data were also used to explore the&#xD;
      contributions of neighborhood characteristics to racial differences in CVD risk factors.&#xD;
      Census defined areas were used as proxies for neighborhoods. Participants were linked to&#xD;
      their census-tract and block-group of residence using their home address, and neighborhood&#xD;
      characteristics were obtained from the 1990 U.S. Census. The three data sets were analyzed&#xD;
      separately. After exploratory and descriptive analyses, regression models were used to&#xD;
      investigate associations of neighborhood characteristics with the outcomes before and after&#xD;
      controlling for individual-level SES and other relevant covariates. Appropriate statistical&#xD;
      methods (mixed effects models) were used to account for the multilevel structure of the data&#xD;
      (individuals nested within neighborhoods and repeated measures nested within individuals),&#xD;
      and the potential violations of the assumption of independence of observations that might&#xD;
      arise from it.&#xD;
