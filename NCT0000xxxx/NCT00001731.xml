      This study will examine whether cyclosporin A eye drops alleviate dry eye syndrome, a&#xD;
      disorder of tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation. The condition damages the surface&#xD;
      of the eye and causes discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-related dry eye syndrome may result from a problem with the immune system in which cells&#xD;
      called lymphocytes infiltrate the tear glands and cause a chronic, progressive inflammatory&#xD;
      process. Previous studies suggest that cyclosporin A may increase tear production or decrease&#xD;
      inflammation on the surface of the eye, or both, improving dry eye symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the study will undergo a complete eye examination, and a small tear sample will&#xD;
      be collected to study tear consistency and composition. A small amount of conjunctiva (the&#xD;
      clear, thin covering of the eye lining the eyelids and eyeball) will be removed to study&#xD;
      substances in it that might provide information on what causes dry eye. A blood sample also&#xD;
      will be taken to look for antibodies found in patients with Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder&#xD;
      characterized by dryness of the mouth, eyes and other mucous membranes. Patients will also&#xD;
      fill out forms providing information on the extent to which their dry eyes bother them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly divided into two treatment groups: one will take a cyclosporin 0.1%&#xD;
      eye drop emulsion; the other will take the emulsion vehicle alone-that is, the same drops but&#xD;
      without the active ingredient cyclosporin. Both groups will take one drop in each eye 4 times&#xD;
      a day for 2 months. Neither the patients nor the doctors will know which patients are&#xD;
      receiving which medication until the study ends. All patients will also be given artificial&#xD;
      teardrops to use for comfort if needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome, also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca or KCS, is a disorder of the tear&#xD;
      film leading to damage to the ocular surface and ocular discomfort. In aqueous tear deficient&#xD;
      dry eye, there is inadequate tear production. Patients with dry eye include those who have&#xD;
      KCS and those with a more severe form of KCS associated with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). In SS,&#xD;
      lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal gland leads to destruction of acinar structures and&#xD;
      impaired glandular function. Although most cases of KCS are not due to Sjogren's Syndrome,&#xD;
      lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal glands of non-Sjogren's KCS patients has been&#xD;
      demonstrated and some authors suggest that age-related atrophic changes of the lacrimal gland&#xD;
      may be secondary to a chronic progressive inflammatory process. Several clinical studies have&#xD;
      indicated that systemic or topical CsA improves some objective or subjective signs of KCS in&#xD;
      patients with or without SS. In this protocol, patients with aqueous tear deficient KCS will&#xD;
      be randomized to treatment with topical CsA 0.1% or the emulsion vehicle. To determine the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of CsA 0.1% treatment in patients with KCS, comprehensive ophthalmologic&#xD;
      examinations and standardized symptom assessments will be performed. In addition, to&#xD;
      determine the ability of topical CSA to alter ocular surface inflammation, pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment conjunctival biopsy specimens will be analyzed for infiltrating lymphocytes.&#xD;

        Diagnosis of CS with documented symptoms and signs (as required below) despite conventional&#xD;

&#xD;
        Schirmer (without anesthesia) less than or equal to 8 mm/5 min in at least one eye;&#xD;
        HOWEVER, if Schirmer (without anesthesia) is zero (0) mm, Schirmer with nasal stimulation&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 3 mm/ 5 min in the same eye, OR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Schirmer (with anesthesia) less than or equal to 10 mm/ 5 min in at least one eye and sum&#xD;
