      The purposes of this study are to identify gene mutations in patients with the muscle&#xD;
      diseases phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency, acid maltase deficiency (GAA deficiency) and&#xD;
      to learn more about how these diseases develop. PFK deficiency is a mild, exercise-related&#xD;
      illness. The childhood form of GAA deficiency (Pompe disease) affects the heart and liver and&#xD;
      is rapidly fatal. The adult form begins in midlife and involves degeneration of skeletal&#xD;
      muscles, leading to weakness and muscle wasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following groups of individuals may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Patients with PFK deficiency, acid maltase deficiency, and relatives who also are&#xD;
      affected. Participants in this group will undergo a brief medical and family history, blood&#xD;
      sample collection, and possibly a physical examination, review of medical records, and&#xD;
      interview with the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Unaffected family members of patients in group A, including both blood relatives and&#xD;
      spouses. People in this group may be asked to provide a history and genetic information. A&#xD;
      review of medical records, interview with the individual's physician, and blood sample may&#xD;
      also be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Control subjects. This group will provide a small blood sample or buccal mucosal&#xD;
      sample (tissue sample collected by brushing the inside of the cheek). The samples will be&#xD;
      coded and the investigators will not know the participants' identities. DNA from these&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed for frequency of gene mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic counseling will be arranged for patients, as appropriate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This laboratory has defined several mutations in muscle diseases which mimic idiopathic&#xD;
      inflammatory myopathy, (IIM, polymyositis or dermatomyositis), in particular,&#xD;
      phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency (Type VII glycogenosis) and acid maltase (GAA)&#xD;
      deficiency (Type II glycogenosis). Some patients with each of these autosomal recessive&#xD;
      diseases have been shown to be genetic compounds, with different mutations on the alleles&#xD;
      from each parent. In this protocol, we seek permission to receive and perform genetic&#xD;
      screening on samples of tissue, blood, or DNA from patients with known metabolic muscle&#xD;
      diseases, their family members, patients with undiagnosed muscle diseases, and groups of&#xD;
      control subjects. Although we will know the names and histories of the patients, and may&#xD;
      choose to admit them under other protocols for further studies, the tests we propose to&#xD;
      perform on their DNA are currently only of laboratory interest and we believe that the&#xD;
      outcome has no implications for the clinical care of the subjects. We propose to obtain oral&#xD;
      consent, as appropriate to take a limited history and to speak to the patient's physician,&#xD;
      from those patients and family members we speak to directly. All specimens obtained in family&#xD;
      studies of a particular disease (e.g., PFK deficiency or GAA deficiency) will be obtained&#xD;
      after written consent and will be tested only for the genes of the particular disease under&#xD;
      study. After completion of those tests, the DNA, or products derived from it will be stored&#xD;
      only under code so that it may be used as a control sample for other studies.&#xD;

        Patients known to have PFK deficiency, GAA deficiency or other known genetic muscle&#xD;
        diseases and their clinically affected relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinically unaffected family members of patients with PFK deficiency, GAA deficiency or&#xD;
        other known genetic muscle diseases, including both blood relatives and spouses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control subjects. These will be individuals whose DNA has been gathered and coded by other&#xD;
        investigators and provided to us solely for the purpose of population surveys of mutation&#xD;
        frequency. Among such controls, may be unaffected individuals of the same racial or&#xD;
        geographic origin as those with a particular mutation. If a convenient bank of such&#xD;
        anonymous samples is unavailable, we will seek such individuals among those who work at the&#xD;
        NIH or their families or friends.&#xD;
