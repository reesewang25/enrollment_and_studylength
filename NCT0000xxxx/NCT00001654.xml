  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dysregulated experience and expression of emotion is implicated in psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      associated both with externalizing problems (aggressive, antisocial behaviors) and&#xD;
      internalizing problems (anxiety, depression). Adolescence is a critical juncture in the&#xD;
      development of these disorders because of the increased incidence and differentiation of&#xD;
      clinical problems during this time period. This is a biobehavioral, longitudinal&#xD;
      investigation of the role of emotion in the development of psychopathology in adolescence.&#xD;
      The focus is on socialization experiences and biological processes that contribute to emotion&#xD;
      dysregulation and disorder in male and female youths between 11 and 16 years of age. Groups&#xD;
      studied include (1) comorbid externalizers and internalizers, (2) externalizers only, (3)&#xD;
      internalizers only, and (4) asymptomatic youth. The adolescents are assessed again two years&#xD;
      later, with instruments and paradigms similar to those used at Time 1. One theme pertains to&#xD;
      the integration and disconnection of emotions across systems (e.g., physiological and&#xD;
      self-report of experience), and how different patterns of emotion relate to psychopathology.&#xD;
      A second theme pertains to development changes in how disorders are manifested (e.g.,&#xD;
      increased differentiation along gender specific pathways). The anticipated number of patient&#xD;
      days per year is 240 for adolescents and mothers, and 120 days for fathers.&#xD;

      Dysregulated emotions are central features of psychiatric disorders associated with both&#xD;
      externalizing problems (aggressive, antisocial behaviors) and internalizing problems&#xD;
      (anxiety, depression). Adolescence is a critical juncture in the development of these&#xD;
      disorders because of the increased incidence and differentiation of clinical problems&#xD;
      particularly along gender-based lines. This is a biobehavioral, longitudinal investigation of&#xD;
      the role of emotion in the development of psychopathology in adolescence. The focus is on&#xD;
      socialization experiences and biological processes that contribute to emotion dysregulation&#xD;
      and disorder. Younger (11-13) years) and older (14-16 years) male and female adolescents are&#xD;
      followed over time to assess outcomes (psychiatric and psychological problems; adaptive&#xD;
      functioning). Groups studied include (1) comorbid externalizers and internalizers, (2)&#xD;
      externalizers, (3) internalizers, and (4) asymptomatic youth. Longitudinal analyses will&#xD;
      examine factors that contribute to continuation, exacerbation, shifts, or improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms over time. Time 1 data collection is complete and 30% of Time 2 cases have been&#xD;
      seen. The current anticipated number of patient days per year is 150 for adolescents and&#xD;
      mothers. Data collection will be completed by January, 2003.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects and their families will be recruited from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusionary criteria will be based on mother and youth report of (a) emotion regulation&#xD;
        problems and (b) the presence of subclinical or clinical symptomatology based on broad-band&#xD;
        scales of the Youth Self-Report or mother's report of behavior problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals meeting entry criteria will be offered entry into the study, and others will be&#xD;
        notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        A debilitating physical impairment (e.g., seizure disorder, cerebral palsy, head trauma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant intellectual impairment (i.e., IQ less than 70).&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition that would impair a participant's ability to respond to the study's paradigms&#xD;
        will be excluded from this study at the time of screening.&#xD;
