  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver disease in the United States and leads to cirrhosis of&#xD;
      the liver in approximately one-third of patients some of whom will ultimately suffer from&#xD;
      liver failure or liver cancer. At present, the recommended therapy of hepatitis C is the&#xD;
      combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin given for 6 to 12 months. Ribavirin is a&#xD;
      antiviral drug that is given by mouth. Interferon is both an antiviral and an immune&#xD;
      medication which must be given by injections (three times a week) and has many difficult side&#xD;
      effects. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of ribavirin and&#xD;
      interferon improve the liver disease of hepatitis C and whether improvements can be&#xD;
      maintained by continuing ribavirin therapy long-term. This study will take 100 to 120&#xD;
      patients suffering from hepatitis C and place them under combination drug therapy with alpha&#xD;
      interferon and ribavirin. The course of drug therapy is scheduled to last 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
      Patients will be selected after appropriate screening for hepatitis C virus and elevated&#xD;
      liver enzymes are conducted and liver biopsy shows chronic hepatitis with some degree of&#xD;
      injury and scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 6 months of the study, subjects will be asked to return to the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic for routine check-ups and blood tests every 2 to 4 weeks. Blood tests will include&#xD;
      tests for hepatitis C virus. If the virus test becomes negative on treatment, the therapy&#xD;
      will be considered successful and will be continued for a full 6 or 12 months (depending upon&#xD;
      the strain of virus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the virus test does not become negative during the first six months of treatment, subjects&#xD;
      will be considered &quot;non-responders&quot; and will stop taking interferon but will continue on&#xD;
      ribavirin alone or an identically appearing placebo tablet. These non-responsive subjects&#xD;
      will continue this therapy for an additional 12 months. (A year-and-a-half total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the drug therapies, subjects will be requested to submit blood samples and&#xD;
      undergo a liver biopsy to determine if the therapy was successful. Test results that reveal a&#xD;
      loss of hepatitis C antibodies or normal levels of liver enzymes will be deemed successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that have successful laboratory test results will be considered for continuation of&#xD;
      ribavirin therapy. Patients that received placebo for a year will be eligible to receive&#xD;
      ribavirin long-term at the end of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 60 and 90 patients with chronic hepatitis C will be enrolled in a study of the&#xD;
      combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin for 12 months with early discontinuation of&#xD;
      therapy and randomization to receive either ribavirin alone or placebo for patients who do&#xD;
      not respond within 6 months of starting therapy. Adult patients will be chosen who have&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C, HCV RNA in serum, and elevations in serum aminotransferases. Patients&#xD;
      who have received alpha interferon in the past will be eligible if they did not have a&#xD;
      sustained response to their previous course of interferon. After medical evaluation and liver&#xD;
      biopsy, patients will begin receiving alpha interferon by subcutaneous injection in a dose of&#xD;
      3 million units three times weekly. At the same time, patients will begin receiving ribavirin&#xD;
      orally in a dose of 1000 mg (if body weight is less than 75 kg) or 1200 mg daily (two or&#xD;
      three capsules of 200 mg twice daily). During the initial 24-week period of combination&#xD;
      therapy, patients will be seen in the outpatient clinic for medical interview, physical&#xD;
      examinations and blood tests at 2 to 4 week intervals. At 24 weeks, patients will be&#xD;
      classified as either responders or non-responders based upon HCV RNA testing of serum.&#xD;
      Responders will continue on the combination therapy for another 24 weeks (total treatment =&#xD;
      48 weeks). Non-responders will stop interferon therapy and will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either ribavirin or identically appearing placebo capsules for 48 weeks (total treatment = 72&#xD;
      weeks). At the 72 week point (18 months after enrollment), all patients will be readmitted&#xD;
      for repeat medical evaluation and liver biopsy. At this point, ribavirin and placebo will be&#xD;
      stopped (unless the patient has had a clear histological and biochemical response to therapy)&#xD;
      and patients will be monitored with outpatient visits at 8 week intervals for another 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who exhibit a histological and biochemical response to ribavirin monotherapy will be&#xD;
      offered a one-year extension of treatment with ribavirin in a gradually reduced dosage. These&#xD;
      patients will be monitored at 8 week intervals and the dose will be reduced by 200 mg per day&#xD;
      every 16 weeks to a minimum dose of 600 mg per day. If the biochemical response is&#xD;
      maintained, patients will continue on therapy for one year and then undergo repeat medical&#xD;
      evaluation and liver biopsy. Continued therapy with ribavirin after this point will depend&#xD;
      upon whether safety and efficacy of ribavirin have been demonstrated and whether ribavirin&#xD;
      has been approved for use in hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary criterion for success of therapy overall will be sustained loss of HCV RNA as&#xD;
      assessed at 18 months. Primary criteria for response among the patients who are randomized to&#xD;
      receive ribavirin or placebo will be degree of histological improvement on liver biopsy.&#xD;
      Secondary criteria will be normalization of ALT levels. This study will allow for therapy of&#xD;
      all patients with chronic hepatitis C with the combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin&#xD;
      and will allow for therapy of patients with resistant forms of chronic hepatitis C with&#xD;
      ribavirin alone and will address whether monotherapy with ribavirin can sustain these&#xD;
      improvements and whether the biochemical improvements reflect amelioration of the underlying&#xD;
      liver disease as judged histologically.&#xD;
