  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of rebeccamycin&#xD;
      analogue in treating women who have stage IIIB or stage IV breast cancer. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. The best way to give rebeccamycin analog in breast cancer patients is not yet known&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the activity of rebeccamycin analog as therapy for advanced breast cancer when&#xD;
      administered in two different treatment schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity associated with administration of rebeccamycin analog therapy in&#xD;
      women with advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate topoisomerase I and II levels in human lymphocytes following treatment with&#xD;
      rebeccamycin analog.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer;&#xD;
             patients without pathologic or cytologic evidence of metastatic disease should have&#xD;
             unequivocal evidence of metastasis on radiographic study or physical exam; patients&#xD;
             must have metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, or locally advanced (stage IIIB) breast&#xD;
             cancer that cannot be treated with curative intent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as lesions that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 10 mm with&#xD;
             conventional techniques; lytic bone lesions meeting these criteria will be considered&#xD;
             measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are required to have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced&#xD;
             breast cancer unless they have progressed within 12 months of concluding adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy; patients may not have had more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for&#xD;
             advanced breast cancer; treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell support in&#xD;
             the metastatic setting, including induction chemotherapy, will be considered 2&#xD;
             treatment regimens; patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy; patients who&#xD;
             have metastatic breast cancer diagnosed within 12 months of concluding adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy will be eligible after 0 or 1 regimens in the metastatic setting;&#xD;
             patients may have received prior hormonal therapy of any type; patients may have been&#xD;
             previously treated with investigational agents or biological agents (e.g. Herceptin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have concluded prior therapy no less than the duration of one cycle of&#xD;
             treatment prior to beginning treatment with rebeccamycin analog, but in all cases&#xD;
             there must be at least a 2 week interval since last treatment; thus, if a patient is&#xD;
             receiving therapy every three weeks, the patient must be at least three weeks from the&#xD;
             last treatment before beginning protocol-based therapy; patients must have recovered&#xD;
             from the toxicities of prior therapy, and meet the performance status and laboratory&#xD;
             criteria for eligibility before beginning treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not receive concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy; all other radiation&#xD;
             therapy, hormonal therapy, or treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) must be stopped&#xD;
             prior to treatment on protocol; patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy may continue&#xD;
             to receive these treatments while on protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 2 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sodium (Na) within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum lipase within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum amylase within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because rebeccamycin analog has been associated with phlebitis, all therapy on&#xD;
             protocol will be given through a central venous line; patients not willing to have a&#xD;
             central line, or those in whom central venous access could not be established, will&#xD;
             not be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of rebeccamycin analog on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation; women should not become pregnant or nurse, nor expect to become&#xD;
             pregnant or nurse, during the study; women in whom there is a suspicion of possible&#xD;
             pregnancy must have a documented negative serum pregnancy test prior to beginning&#xD;
             therapy; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational anti-neoplastic agents, with&#xD;
             the following exceptions: patients may participate in concurrent studies of supportive&#xD;
             therapies, including anti-nausea or bisphosphonate-based treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases may be included if they meet the following 2&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated on study&#xD;
