      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. It&#xD;
      is not yet known whether high-dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation is&#xD;
      more effective than standard chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      with that of high-dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating&#xD;
      women who have advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the overall survival in locally advanced, inflammatory, or operable&#xD;
      large primary breast cancer (greater than 3 cm) patients with positive axillary lymph nodes&#xD;
      at surgery following primary chemotherapy, receiving either conventional chemotherapy or high&#xD;
      dose chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. II. Compare the relapse-free survival and quality of&#xD;
      life in these patients receiving this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter, open label study. Patients are stratified by&#xD;
      study center and number of positive axillary lymph nodes at surgery. Patients are randomized&#xD;
      to receive conventional or high dose adjuvant chemotherapy. Arm I: Patients receive&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil IV&#xD;
      administered once every 3 weeks for 8 courses. Arm II: Patients receive high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered on day 1. Patients undergo peripheral blood&#xD;
      progenitor cell (PBPC) collection, then receive cyclophosphamide and thiotepa IV for 4 days,&#xD;
      13-28 days after PBPC collection. Peripheral blood progenitor cells are then reinfused.&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiotherapy during or after chemotherapy and receive oral tamoxifen for 5&#xD;
      years, beginning at the same time as radiotherapy. Estrogen receptor negative patients may&#xD;
      receive tamoxifen at the discretion of the treating physician. Quality of life is assessed&#xD;
      before chemotherapy, then at 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients are followed at 12, 18, and 24&#xD;
      months, then annually for 5 years or until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 300 patients.&#xD;
