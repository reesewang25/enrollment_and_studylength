      To conduct a 25-year follow-up of the surviving participants in the Western Collaborative&#xD;
      Group Study, the first large prospective study of coronary heart disease risk factors to&#xD;
      incorporate direct assessment of Type A behavior.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WCGS began in 1960 with 3,524 male volunteers who were employed by 11 California&#xD;
      companies. Subjects were 39 to 59 years old and free of heart disease as determined by&#xD;
      electrocardiogram. After the initial screening, the study population dropped to 3,154 and the&#xD;
      number of companies to 10 because of various exclusions. The cohort comprised both blue- and&#xD;
      white-collar employees. At baseline the following information was collected:&#xD;
      socio-demographic including age, education, marital status, income, occupation; physical and&#xD;
      physiological including height, weight, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and corneal arcus;&#xD;
      biochemical including cholesterol and lipoprotein fractions; medical and family history and&#xD;
      use of medications; behavioral data including Type A interview, smoking, exercise, and&#xD;
      alcohol use. Later surveys added data on anthropometry, triglycerides, Jenkins Activity&#xD;
      Survey, and caffeine use. Average follow-up continued for 8.5 years with repeat examinations.&#xD;
      During the 8.5 year follow-up, coronary heart disease occurred in 257 of the initially&#xD;
      disease-free group, of whom 50 died of coronary heart disease. There were 90 non-coronary&#xD;
      disease deaths. Multiple logistic analyses confirmed the roles of blood pressure, serum&#xD;
      cholesterol and cigarette smoking as risk factors. The study also found that Type A behavior,&#xD;
      as assessed by a Structured Interview, was associated independently with the risk of coronary&#xD;
      heart disease and constituted a 2:1 risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1982, Dr. Richard Brand and Dr. David Ragland at the School of Public Health, University&#xD;
      of California at Berkeley, conducted a Mortality Follow-up of the 3,014 WCGS subjects living&#xD;
      in 1969. The purpose of the 1982 follow-up was to locate the original participants, determine&#xD;
      vital status, and obtain information about the health status of the participants who were&#xD;
      still alive, and cause of death of participants who had died between 1969 and 1982. All&#xD;
      individuals contacted were asked to participate in the proposed 25-year follow-up physical&#xD;
      examination. At that time in 1983 there were 2,534 surviving subjects. All data gathered by&#xD;
      the 1982 Mortality Follow-up were used in the 25-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up evaluated the power of cardiovascular disease risk factors, as measured in&#xD;
      1960, to predict coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality over 25 years and to predict&#xD;
      stroke. It also evaluated the power of changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors as&#xD;
      observed across the seven repeat exams from 1960 to 1969, to predict long-term morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and provided the basis for a potential future follow-up of an aging cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 25-year follow-up extended the existing database by adding current risk factor status and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease morbidity data collected by physical examinations and personal&#xD;
      interviews. The new data included physical, physiological, and biochemical variables, health&#xD;
      behavior, medical and family history, and Type A behavior. Existing mortality records were&#xD;
      updated and used to determine cause of death and, where possible, the extent of&#xD;
      cardiovascular pathology.&#xD;
