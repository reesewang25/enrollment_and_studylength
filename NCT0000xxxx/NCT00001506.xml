      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a training, natural history of disease, and screening protocol for the evaluation,&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up of patients with dermatologic diseases and systemic diseases with&#xD;
      cutaneous manifestations. This protocol was developed to allow subject enrollment for&#xD;
      teaching purposes and to allow for second opinions regarding relatively complicated patients,&#xD;
      and to allow for evaluation of non-invasive tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of&#xD;
      cutaneous manifestations. This protocol promotes a critical link between the NCI, CCR&#xD;
      Dermatology Branch and the local and national extramural medical communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide clinical material to fulfill the educational mission of the Dermatology&#xD;
           Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn about the natural history of selected dermatologic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects regardless of age, gender, or racial/ethnic group with dermatologic disease or&#xD;
      systemic disease with cutaneous manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated and treated according to generally&#xD;
      available, standard procedures and therapeutic modalities. Samples of blood and skin will be&#xD;
      studied by routine and specialized investigative methods to establish these patients&#xD;
      diagnosis, response to treatment, and/or disease progression. Non-invasive tools may be used&#xD;
      as part of the examination and assessment of cutaneous manifestations of disease.&#xD;
