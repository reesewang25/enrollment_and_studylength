  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cushing Syndrome is an endocrine disorder causing an over production of the hormone cortisol.&#xD;
      Cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland as a response to the production of corticotropin&#xD;
      (ACTH) in the pituitary gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 10% and 20% of patients with hypercortisolism (Cushing Syndrome) have ectopic&#xD;
      production of the hormone ACTH. Meaning, the hormone is not being released from the normal&#xD;
      site, the pituitary gland. In many cases the ectopic ACTH is being produced by a tumor of the&#xD;
      lung, thymus, or pancreas. However, in approximately 50% of these patients the source of the&#xD;
      ACTH cannot be found even with the use of extensive imaging studies such as computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear scans (111-indium&#xD;
      pentetreotide). The ability of these tests to locate the source of the hormone production is&#xD;
      dependent on the changes of anatomy and / or the dose and adequate uptake of the radioactive&#xD;
      agent. The inability to detect the source of ectopic ACTH production often results in&#xD;
      unnecessary pituitary surgery or irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the previously described tests, positron emission tomography (PET scan) has the&#xD;
      ability to detect pathologic tissue based on physiologic and biochemical processes within the&#xD;
      abnormal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test whether fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG),&#xD;
      fluorine-18-dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-DOPA) or use of a higher dose of 111-indium&#xD;
      pentetreotide can be used to successfully localize the source of ectopic ACTH production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 10 percent and 20 percent of patients with hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) have&#xD;
      ectopic production of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that causes cortisol excess. In&#xD;
      approximately 50 percent of these patients, the source of ACTH cannot be found despite very&#xD;
      detailed and extensive examination including imaging studies such as computed tomography&#xD;
      scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and octreotide scan (octreoscan) using the conventional&#xD;
      low dose of indium-111 pentetreotide. The sensitivity and specificity of these imaging&#xD;
      studies depends on anatomic alterations and/or the dose and adequate uptake of&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical. In contrast, positron emission tomography (PET) has the ability to&#xD;
      detect pathologic tissue based on physiologic and biochemical processes within the abnormal&#xD;
      tissue. This protocol tests whether fluorine-18 dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-DOPA) or use of a&#xD;
      higher dose of indium-111 pentetreotide (Octreoscan) can be used to localize successfully the&#xD;
      source of ectopic ACTH production. In addition the study examines whether administration of&#xD;
      the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone can improved the sensitivity of the standard dose&#xD;
      Octreoscan. Eligible patients participating in this arm of the study will have a second&#xD;
      standard dose scan. Others will receive a higher dose octreoscan instead.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All eligible patients are invited to participate in this protocol. Patients are adults with&#xD;
        possible ectopic Cushing syndrome. Since both men and women are affected with ectopic&#xD;
        Cushing syndrome, both sexes are studied. All ethnic and racial groups are at risk and will&#xD;
        be included. Patients must be willing to return to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#xD;
        Clinical Center for follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or lactating women. A pregnancy test is performed in women of childbearing&#xD;
        potential (up to age 55) unless they have a history of hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children (age less than18) are excluded. Because ectopic ACTH secretion is rare in this age&#xD;
        group, the likelihood of benefit is less and does not balance the risk of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients taking medications that alter CYP3A4 activity will not be eligible for the&#xD;
        mifepristone study, since this P450 system metabolizes mifepristone. Such participants&#xD;
        would receive a clinical high dose (18 mCi) octreoscan (H-OCT) instead, if the standard 6&#xD;
        mCi octreoscan (L-OCT) was negative. Patients with hypokalemia (K &lt; 3.5 milliequivalent&#xD;
        (mEq)/L) despite medical therapy with replacement or mineralocorticoid antagonists will&#xD;
        also be excluded from the mifepristone studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  severe active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  clinically significantly impaired cardiovascular (e.g., history of abnormally low&#xD;
             ejection fraction, the presence of moderate pulmonary fluid overload or leg edema, and&#xD;
             blood pressure over 190/100), abnormal coagulation (partial thromboplastin time or&#xD;
             prothrombin time elevated by 30 percent above the normal values), hematopoietic&#xD;
             (hematocrit less than 30 percent, hemoglobin below 10 g/dl, white count below 3000&#xD;
             K/microliter (UL), and platelets below 100,000 K/mm(3)), hepatic (liver enzymes&#xD;
             elevated by 3-fold above normal values) or renal function (plasma creatinine level&#xD;
             over 2.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  impaired mental capacity or markedly abnormal psychiatric evaluation that precludes&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  body weight over 136 kg, which is the limit for the tables used in the scanning areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  combined blood withdrawal, during the six weeks preceding the study, of greater than&#xD;
             450 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known allergy to 111-indium pentetreotide or other somatostatin analogues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  strong evidence for Cushing disease. This includes those with positive inferior&#xD;
             petrosal sinus sampling or a lesion on pituitary MRI.&#xD;

      <desc>AEs within 24 hrs of F-DOPA (ten half-lives rounded up), would be reported to the sponsor. Minor deviations in standard care, such as decisions not to schedule all possible imaging (eg deleting pelvic scans in a patient with a lung mass) will not be reported. Expected AEs (those in the protocol/F-DOPA investigator's brochure, and thromboembolism, hypertension, infection, metabolic derangements, which are common in Cushing's syndrome) would be reported only if they become unanticipated problems.</desc>
