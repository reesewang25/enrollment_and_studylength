      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among Latina women (LW) in the&#xD;
      United States. Nursing knowledge in the area of CVD and Latina women is currently&#xD;
      underdeveloped. Most studies have included Mexican women with limited information on how&#xD;
      predictors such as resources, situational, personal, and demographic factors have an effect&#xD;
      on the CVD-related dietary practices, physical activity, and exercise practices among Latina&#xD;
      women subgroups such as Central American women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct a cross-sectional and follow-up preliminary intervention study in order to&#xD;
      describe and analyze the CVD-related diet, physical activity, and exercise practices&#xD;
      predictors in 221 Mexican and Central American women recruited from six counties in Northern&#xD;
      California. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with Mexican American and Central American&#xD;
      women (ages 40-75) who had at least one risk factor for CVD to answer the following&#xD;
      questions: What were the CVD-related risk factors, dietary practices, physical activity, and&#xD;
      exercise behaviors in Mexican and Central American women who were 40 to 75 years and who had&#xD;
      at least one risk factor for CVD? What was the relationship between predictor variables&#xD;
      (resources, situational, personal, and demographic factors) with CVD-related diet practices,&#xD;
      physical activity, and exercise behaviors (outcome variables)?, and what were the short and&#xD;
      intermediate-term effects of a cardiovascular nursing intervention on diet, physical&#xD;
      activity, and exercise? A sample of 221 women was targeted. Data were collected during the&#xD;
      first two years of the project to provide substantial research-based information to develop a&#xD;
      cardiovascular nursing intervention to support Latina women efforts to promote heart health&#xD;
      and prevent CVD. Data were analyzed during the third year and the cardiovascular nursing&#xD;
      intervention was developed to determine the short (3 months) and intermediate-term (6 months)&#xD;
      effects in the outcome variables. A randomly selected sample of 60 women from the same cohort&#xD;
      was randomly assigned to the developed intervention group (n=30 in each group) and to a&#xD;
      delayed-intervention control group.&#xD;
