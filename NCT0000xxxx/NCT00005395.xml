      To clarify the relationship of the arterial lesions to aging, define the influence of the&#xD;
      arterial changes on the development of stroke, brain infarction, and dementia, and provide a&#xD;
      better understanding of vascular dementia.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphologic delineation of the arterial lesions will assist the use of experimental models to&#xD;
      study molecular mechanisms underlying the lesions and the development of pharmacologic&#xD;
      methods for controlling these mechanisms. Further examination of risk factors for the&#xD;
      arterial lesions will indicate opportunities for prevention or modifying their evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was based on data including risk factors and autopsy brain sections from deceased&#xD;
      men from the Honolulu Heart Program. In this cohort, medial and intimal lesions of brain&#xD;
      parenchymal arteries were significantly associated with brain infarction and three times more&#xD;
      common in men dying of stroke than of non-cardiovascular causes. The specific aims of the&#xD;
      study were 1) delineation of the morphologic characteristics of the brain parenchymal artery&#xD;
      lesions, their regional anatomic distribution, and their relationship to changes in adjacent&#xD;
      brain parenchyma and the degree of atherosclerosis in the major intracranial arteries; 2)&#xD;
      characterization of the relationship in men between the arterial lesions and advancing age;&#xD;
      3) characterization in men over 60-65 years of age of the relationship of the arterial&#xD;
      lesions to stroke, brain infarction or hemorrhage, and dementia; 4) identification of&#xD;
      additional risk factors associated with the arterial lesions. The arterial lesions and&#xD;
      adjacent brain parenchyma were examined with conventional histologic stains and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical markers for specific cellular and extracellular components of the&#xD;
      arterial wall. The prevalence and extent of each type of arterial lesion were determined at&#xD;
      three anatomic sites. Baseline risk factors thought to be related to stroke and brain&#xD;
      infarction were examined for association with the arterial lesions. Statistical tests of&#xD;
      association were based on univariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression models&#xD;
      controlled, when necessary, for age.&#xD;
