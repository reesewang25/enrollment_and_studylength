      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to explore how the brain changes&#xD;
      (reorganizes itself) in response to learning and to brain lesions in healthy people and&#xD;
      people with various physical disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and patients with disabilities including blindness, limb amputation,&#xD;
      hemispherectomy (removal of a cerebral hemisphere), and stroke may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will be screened with medical and neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have MRI scans while they lie still or perform certain movements, as&#xD;
      instructed. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to show&#xD;
      structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan, the subject lies on a table in a&#xD;
      narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member through&#xD;
      an intercom system at all times during the procedure. All participants will first have a scan&#xD;
      to show brain structure, which will take about 30 minutes. A second scan will measure blood&#xD;
      flow or biochemical concentration and will take from 1 to 2 1/2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on their disability, patients will participate in one of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blindness-This will study the ability of blind people to process tactile information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke- This will study mechanisms underlying recovery of motor function after stroke.&#xD;
           The patient will perform voluntary movements or remain still during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amputation- This will study mechanisms underlying the ability of the brain to reorganize&#xD;
           after amputation. The patient will move different parts of the body or remain still&#xD;
           during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemispherectomy- This will study mechanisms underlying the ability of one side of the&#xD;
           brain to control movements of both arms. The patient will make different kinds of&#xD;
           movements during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers will participate in one of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use-dependent plasticity- This will evaluate the effectiveness of amphetamine and&#xD;
           placebo in demonstrating brain flexibility. The volunteer will take an amphetamine or&#xD;
           placebo (inactive pill) before the scan and then perform a specific exercise using the&#xD;
           thumb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor fatigue- This will study the mechanisms that underlie fatigue, which affect many&#xD;
           patients with neurological conditions. The volunteer will contract muscles in the&#xD;
           forearm and hand for several minutes until he or she feels fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Light deprivation- This will evaluate changes in the brain that occur after light&#xD;
           deprivation. The volunteer will remain at rest in the scanner for up to 150 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somatosensory stimulation-This will examine whether stimulation of the wrist can cause&#xD;
           changes in hand representation in the part of the brain that controls movement. The&#xD;
           volunteer will make hand movements at different times during the test. In addition, mild&#xD;
           electric shocks will be delivered to the wrist for up to 2 hours. Although the shock&#xD;
           intensity is regulated to avoid pain, there may be some discomfort.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate plastic changes in human cerebral cortex in&#xD;
      health and disease. The overall hypothesis is that it is possible to identify neuroimaging&#xD;
      patterns reflecting reorganization in the human cerebral cortex using fMRI and that it is&#xD;
      possible to obtain information on the mechanisms underlying some of these plastic changes by&#xD;
      using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA. This information is potentially&#xD;
      important for the understanding of mechanisms of cortical reorganization operating in humans.&#xD;
      Patients and normal volunteers will be scanned at rest and during performance of different&#xD;
      tasks. These studies should provide new information on mechanisms of human plasticity. The&#xD;
      MRI techniques used for that purpose are functional MRI (fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and&#xD;
      conventional MRI with magnets between 1.5 and 4 tesla.&#xD;
