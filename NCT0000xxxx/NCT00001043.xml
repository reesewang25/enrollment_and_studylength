      AMENDED 8/94: To expand the safety and immunogenicity profile of MN rgp160 vaccine&#xD;
      (Immuno-AG) by administering a higher dose (800 mcg) at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months and 0, 2, 8&#xD;
      and 14 months (these two schedules were compared in VEU 013A using a dose of 200 mcg). To&#xD;
      obtain plasma following the fourth immunization. To evaluate skin test reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIGINAL (replaced): To determine in healthy volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of two&#xD;
      immunizations of MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) in combination with a live recombinant&#xD;
      vaccinia virus LAV HIV-1 gp160 vaccine (HIVAC-1e) versus DryVax (the standard smallpox&#xD;
      vaccine that was used for many years) control in combination with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIGINAL (replaced): A gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain, the most prevalent strain of&#xD;
      HIV-1 in the United States, has been developed. A previous study showed that a combination&#xD;
      vaccine strategy, consisting of priming with HIVAC-1e followed by boosting with a gp160&#xD;
      subunit vaccine, resulted in humoral and cellular immune responses of greater and longer&#xD;
      duration than either vaccine alone. Thus, a live vector/subunit boost approach using the MN&#xD;
      rgp160 vaccine merits investigation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      AMENDED 8/94: Volunteers are randomized to receive 800 mcg MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) or&#xD;
      adjuvant control (placebo) on one of two dosing schedules. Sixteen volunteers receive&#xD;
      candidate vaccine and four volunteers receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIGINAL (replaced): Volunteers are randomized to receive either HIVAC-1e on days 0 and 56&#xD;
      followed by immunization with MN rgp160 vaccine on days 224 and 364, or DryVax control on&#xD;
      days 0 and 56 followed by placebo on days 224 and 364. Ten volunteers are entered on the MN&#xD;
      rgp160 vaccine arm and two volunteers on the placebo arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 7/96: Two additional booster immunizations of 600 mcg of MN rgp 120/HIV-1&#xD;
      vaccine given at study months 22 and 24 to consenting St. Louis University volunteers.&#xD;
