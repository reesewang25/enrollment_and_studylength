    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether T Wave Alternans can predict ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death (SCD) in a prospective epidemiologic natural history study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective epidemiologic pilot study included 550 patients that had left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction and no history of sustained ventricular arrhythmias. The primary hypothesis&#xD;
      tested was whether there was an increased risk of having an arrhythmic event when T Wave&#xD;
      Alternans was present in the patient. The secondary aims included comparing risk due to T&#xD;
      Wave Alternans between the ischemic patients and non-ischemic patients and assessing whether&#xD;
      T Wave Alternans remained an independent predictor of risk upon adjustment for other known&#xD;
      risk factors for arrhythmic events such as ejection fraction, ventricular ectopy, NSVT,&#xD;
      average NN interval, and RR interval variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study approach was a standard epidemiologic surveillance technique. The subject&#xD;
      population consisted of individuals with Class I to III heart failure who will underwent a&#xD;
      TWA and Holter monitor test and then were followed for up to two years or until arrhythmic&#xD;
      events occured.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death accounts for approximately 400,000 deaths each year in the United States&#xD;
      and remains a health problem of epidemic proportions. Most sudden cardiac deaths are caused&#xD;
      by fatal ventricular arrhythmias. An effort aimed at the primary prevention of sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death requires efficient identification of patients who are at high enough risk for having&#xD;
      these arrhythmias to warrant aggressive prophylactic therapy. A number of recently completed,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD)&#xD;
      can prevent sudden cardiac death in a highly selected group of high-risk patients. When these&#xD;
      trials are viewed together, the only patients in whom the prophylactic implantation of an ICD&#xD;
      has proven benefit are those patients identified by documented, spontaneous or inducible,&#xD;
      sustained ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two randomized treatment trials (MADIT II, SCD-HEFT) tested the hypothesis that implantation&#xD;
      of an ICD would reduce mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction without any further risk tratification. However, the implications of&#xD;
      these two trials-implantation of an ICD in every patient with CHF-were unlikely to be&#xD;
      accepted either by the medical community or by health care payers. More efficient methods of&#xD;
      risk stratification were necessary to identify those patients with CHF who were most likely&#xD;
      to benefit from prophylactic treatment with an ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T Wave Alternans is a subtle every-other-beat variation in electrocardiographic T waves that&#xD;
      is prognostic of patients at high risk for life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death. It has recently been shown that T Wave Alternans (TWA) measured during&#xD;
      exercise is strongly associated with inducible monomorphic CVT and with subsequent&#xD;
      spontaneous arrhythmic events. This preliminary data suggest that TWA may be an efficient and&#xD;
      non-invasive surrogate for electrophysiologic testing to screen patients who may be at&#xD;
      high-risk for sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
