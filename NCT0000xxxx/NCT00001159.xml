  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be patients diagnosed with or suspected to have a thyroid&#xD;
      function disorder. These conditions may include: hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid&#xD;
      hormone resistance, Graves' Dermopathy, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secreting&#xD;
      pituitary adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to further understand the natural history, clinical&#xD;
      presentation, and genetics of thyroid function disorders. Many of the tests performed are in&#xD;
      the context of standard medical care that is offered to all patients with thyroid function&#xD;
      disorders. In addition, blood and tissue samples may be taken for research and genetic&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with thyroid function abnormalities (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism) are studied&#xD;
      and treated in this protocol. Patients undergo routine history and physical examination,&#xD;
      standard endocrine blood and urine tests, a standard TRH test, thyroid nuclear medicine&#xD;
      scans, thyroidal radioiodine (RAI) or technetium (99mTc) uptake measurements, as well as&#xD;
      X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies or other standard&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures, as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1. To understand the pathophysiology and various causes of thyroid function&#xD;
           abnormalities (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2. To longitudinally follow the effects of standard therapies for patients with abnormal&#xD;
           thyroid functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3. To create a repository of clinical data and biospecimens for future research of&#xD;
           thyroid disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective will be accomplished by obtaining clinical data and biospecimens during&#xD;
      standard care procedures and tests performed on enrolled subjects being evaluated as an&#xD;
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The categories of subjects eligible to participate in this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities (e.g. hypothyroidism,&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism, extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism&#xD;
             resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta&#xD;
             subunit, Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with thyroid function test (TFT) abnormalities due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-thyroidal illness&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abnormalities of serum TH binding proteins leading to euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia&#xD;
                  or hypotriiodothyronemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Genetic deficiency of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antibodies to mouse immunoglobulins leading to an artifactual elevation in the&#xD;
                  TSH ultrasensitive (&quot;3rd generation&quot;) assay which may mimic &quot;inappropriate&quot;&#xD;
                  secretion of TSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion and exclusion criteria for each group of subjects are given below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities will be eligible to p rticipate if&#xD;
        the individual meets all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, aged 6 months+.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hyperthyroid states include but are not restricted to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Graves' disease (GD) thought to result from thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins&#xD;
             (TSIg's), a subclass of which also stimulate eye muscle and fatty tissue producing&#xD;
             exophthalmos (Graves' ophthalmopathy), as well as the skin in the pretibial area&#xD;
             causing pretibial myxedema (Graves' dermopathy);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), a painful inflammation thought to result from viral&#xD;
             infection with Coxsackie, as well as other viruses;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Silent thyroiditis, a painless inflammation thought to result from autoimmune attack&#xD;
             of thyrocytes by antimicrosomal antibodies directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO),&#xD;
             as well as antithyroglobulin(anti-Tg) antibodies;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Single or multiple hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules of unknown etiology, probably&#xD;
             resulting from the activation of certain thyroid oncogenes and/or growth factors, such&#xD;
             as the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHR) and the a-subunit of the G protein (Ga);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Iodide-induced hyperthyroidism of unknown etiology;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Surreptitious administration of thyroid hormone (TH), usually present in patients with&#xD;
             underlying psychiatric disease or occasionally related to patients with obesity and&#xD;
             other eating disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Trophoblastic neoplasms, thought to result from high levels of hCG secretion, which,&#xD;
             because of its structural similarity to TSH, causes &quot;spillover&quot; of action at the TSHR&#xD;
             level;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. &quot;Inappropriate&quot; secretion of TSH, which may be present either in patients with TSH-&#xD;
             producing pituitary tumors (TSHomas) or from a non-neoplastic cause, i.e. pituitary&#xD;
             resistance to the action of thyroid hormone (3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hypothyroid states include but are not restricted to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Primary (or thyroidal) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from auto-antibodies to&#xD;
             thyroid proteins, such as antimicrosomal antibodies to TPO usually associated with&#xD;
             lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis (HT) or atrophic thyroiditis, or blocking&#xD;
             antibodies to the TSHR, usually in the context of non-goitrous hypothyroidism;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Secondary (or pituitary) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from tumors of the&#xD;
             pituitary of non-thyrotropic origin such, as growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumors or&#xD;
             prolactinomas;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tertiary (or hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from a deficiency in the&#xD;
             hypothalamic hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), either of unknown etiology&#xD;
             or secondary to a pituitary tumor;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Bio-inactive TSH, either relating to an endogenous abnormality of hypothalamic&#xD;
             hormones or secondary to pituitary tumors (and usually related to abnormal&#xD;
             glycosylation patterns of the TSH molecule);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), a disease which has been shown to be&#xD;
             due to abnormalities in the TH receptor, c-erbA-beta (or TR- beta).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The above are the principal disorders under study, but we may also investigate other&#xD;
        abnormalities, such as extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism&#xD;
        resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta subunit,&#xD;
        Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS (among others).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
