      To determine whether there were any long term sequelae of the drugs used in the Coronary Drug&#xD;
      Project (estrogens, dextrothyroxine, nicotinic acid, clofibrate).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three of the CDP treatments (two doses of estrogen and dextrothyroxine) were stopped&#xD;
      prematurely because of toxicity. At the time the treatments were stopped, it was thought that&#xD;
      future assessment of the status of patients on those treatments would be important to&#xD;
      evaluate long-term sequellae. Another clinical trial evaluating clofibrate for primary&#xD;
      prevention found that more patients on that treatment than on placebo had died. This effect&#xD;
      persisted even after the treatment was stopped. Therefore, it was considered necessary to&#xD;
      follow the CDP patients on clofibrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the original 834l patients, about 6000 were still alive in March l975. Cause-specific&#xD;
      mortality in those patients was assessed through March l980.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vital status of the subjects known to be alive at the end of the CDP in March l975 was&#xD;
      assessed as of March l980. This was accomplished through questioning the local investigators,&#xD;
      letters to the subjects, and by use of Social Security Administration and National Death&#xD;
      Index records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report (QVR)&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
