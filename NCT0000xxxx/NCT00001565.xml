  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetic trial. Patients receive phenylbutyrate through a central venous&#xD;
      catheter for each 28 day cycle. The first several days of drug administration should be&#xD;
      inpatient. Cycles may be repeated if there is no tumor progression or dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLT). There are no breaks between cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a minimum of 3 patients have completed at least 4 weeks of therapy without DLT, new&#xD;
      patients will be entered at the next dose level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenylbutyrate is an aromatic fatty acid that is converted to phenylacetate in vivo by&#xD;
      mitochondrial beta-oxidation to phenylacetate. Preclinical studies have shown that continuous&#xD;
      exposure to phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate can induce tumor cytostasis and differentiation&#xD;
      in a wide variety of cell lines including malignant gliomas and neuroblastomas. However,&#xD;
      phenylbutyrate has been shown to be a more potent differentiating agent than phenylacetate in&#xD;
      a variety of tumor cell lines. In addition, phenylbutyrate appears to have molecular&#xD;
      activities that are distinct from phenylacetate. The objective of this trial is to determine&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose and the toxicities of phenylbutyrate administered as a continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion for 28 days. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of phenylbutyrate and its&#xD;
      metabolite, phenylacetate, will be studied using both model-dependent and model-independent&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
