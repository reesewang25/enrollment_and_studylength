      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Gene therapy such as oblimersen may make tumor cells more sensitive&#xD;
      to chemotherapy drugs. Combining irinotecan and oblimersen may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oblimersen and irinotecan&#xD;
      in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      augmerosen (G3139) administered in combination with irinotecan in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      toxicity of this drug combination in this patient population. III. Assess the plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of this combination in these patients. IV. Document the antitumor activity&#xD;
      of this drug combination in these patients in a phase II study. V. Determine the relevant&#xD;
      biologic endpoints of treatment in tumor biopsies prior to and after therapy with G3139 at&#xD;
      two dose levels and assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive augmerosen (G3139) IV&#xD;
      continuously on days 1-7 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 6. Treatment continues&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6&#xD;
      patients receive escalating doses of G3139 and irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are&#xD;
      accrued to receive treatment with G3139 and irinotecan at the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 30 days until toxicity resolves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this&#xD;
      study. A maximum of 55 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.&#xD;
