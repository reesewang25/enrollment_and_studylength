    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of HIV on bone marrow cells. Various types of cells from&#xD;
      bone marrow will be studied to learn which cells become infected with HIV, what changes occur&#xD;
      in the number of or growth patterns of the cells, what kinds of proteins the cells make in&#xD;
      the presence or absence of HIV and whether the cells can function normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected and non-infected individuals 18 years of age and older may participate in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw: Blood will be drawn through a needle from a hand or arm vein. About 150&#xD;
           milliliters (10 tablespoons) will be collected each time. No more than 450 ml (30&#xD;
           tablespoons) will be taken over a 6-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirate: Bone marrow will be drawn from the hipbone. For this procedure, a&#xD;
           local anesthetic is injected in the skin over the hipbone. A small needle is put about&#xD;
           1/2-inch through the shell of the bone and about 3 to 4 teaspoons of marrow are drawn&#xD;
           from the cavity into a syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White cells from marrow of uninfected individuals may be infected with HIV in the laboratory&#xD;
      and grown over time for study. Alternatively, uninfected cells may be used as controls to&#xD;
      compare with cells from HIV-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White cells from marrow of HIV-infected individuals will be grown in the laboratory and&#xD;
      studied in comparison with cells from uninfected individuals. Or, bone marrow cells may be&#xD;
      injected into immune-deficient mice to try to develop an animal model for HIV infection.&#xD;
      White blood cells will also be studied in the laboratory to learn how the immune system&#xD;
      responds to HIV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematologic abnormalities occur with high frequency (up to 70% of patients) in human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities is&#xD;
      not currently understood, although both an abnormal bone marrow environment (e.g., altered&#xD;
      growth factor production) and direct infection and dysfunction of progenitor cells themselves&#xD;
      have been postulated. Under the current protocol we have studied bone marrow precursor cells&#xD;
      from both HIV infected and uninfected individuals and have shown not only that these cells&#xD;
      are infectable in vitro with HIV but also infected in vivo in a subpopulation of seropositive&#xD;
      individuals. While the effects of HIV infection of precursor cells on subsequent&#xD;
      hematopoietic potential is not completely understood, we could not show a clear correlation&#xD;
      between in vivo infection of these cells and suppressed hematopoiesis. It seems clear from&#xD;
      this study and others that other alterations within the bone marrow environment must play a&#xD;
      role in the clinically observed hematologic abnormalities. We therefore wish to continue our&#xD;
      studies to elucidate the relative contributions of direct infection of myeloid progenitor&#xD;
      cells and alterations in bone marrow environment in the pathology seen in HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals. Understanding the pathogenesis of abnormal hematopoiesis in HIV infection will&#xD;
      allow investigators to design appropriate therapeutic strategies. Using recently developed&#xD;
      techniques we also wish to use bone marrow cells from HIV infected individuals to establish&#xD;
      antibody libraries. This will allow the study of immunologically important epitopes on the&#xD;
      HIV virion with potential impact on the subsequent design of HIV vaccines or introduction of&#xD;
      passive immunotherapy. Thirdly, research in the field of HIV has been hampered by the lack of&#xD;
      an appropriate animal model. One promising approach is the use of human bone marrow to&#xD;
      reconstitute lethally irradiated Balb/c mice. Once the human hematopoietic system is&#xD;
      established in the mouse, it may be possible to infect these animals with HIV and study in an&#xD;
      in vivo model the effects of infection on hematopoiesis.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both HIV seropositive and seronegative individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have adequate blood counts (HIV positive volunteers: hemoglobin greater than or equal to&#xD;
        9.0 g/dL, HCT greater than or equal to 28%, platelets greater than or equal to 50,000; HIV&#xD;
        negative healthy normal volunteers: hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12.5 g/dL, HCT&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 38%, platelets greater than or equal to 150,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aged 18 years or older, male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to give informed, written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This protocol was amended in 1990 to allow inclusion of Zairian patients who were studied&#xD;
        by the principal investigator on site in Zaire. These marrow aspirations were all performed&#xD;
        in March-April 1990 before the current requirements for Multi-site Collaborations were&#xD;
        instituted. At this time, no further off-site collaboration will be undertaken under this&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients/volunteers with blood clotting disorders as demonstrated by an elevated PT, PTT or&#xD;
        low platelet count (Seropositive: platelets greater than or equal to 50,000; Seronegative:&#xD;
        platelets greater than or equal to150,000.&#xD;
