    <textblock>
      The study will allow researchers to obtain blood, plasma, DNA, and RNA for genetic studies of&#xD;
      insulin. There will be a focus on the causes of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Insulin is a hormone found in the body that controls the level of sugar in the blood. Insulin&#xD;
      resistance refers to conditions like diabetes when insulin does not work properly. In this&#xD;
      study researchers would like to compare patients with diabetes and other forms of insulin&#xD;
      resistance to normal individuals. The study will investigate how insulin attaches to cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will take 4 to 6 ounces (100-150 ml) of blood from adult patients and may request&#xD;
      up to 12 ounces (one unit) of blood if necessary. Skin samples may be taken for a biopsy if&#xD;
      further genetic testing is necessary. In addition some patients may be asked not to eat for&#xD;
      up to 72 hours prior to testing.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin is the key hormone responsible for regulating the level of glucose in plasma. In&#xD;
      several disease states (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes, and acromegaly), the target cells are&#xD;
      resistant to insulin action. Insulin resistance leads to metabolic complications including&#xD;
      diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and&#xD;
      reproductive dysfunction. The intramural research program of the NIDDK has a long history of&#xD;
      studying patients with rare disorders of extreme insulin resistance. We use what is learned&#xD;
      from these rare patients both to develop therapeutics for rare diseases, and to apply what is&#xD;
      learned to understand more common forms of insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives: (1) To understand the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and its&#xD;
      relationship to cardiovascular disease, (2) To study the molecular genetics underlying&#xD;
      various causes of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, and (3) To understand the natural&#xD;
      history of insulin resistance disorders, including their response to FDA approved therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: Genetic causes of insulin resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Diabetes control (hemoglobin A1c) and complications (rates of micro- and&#xD;
      macrovascular disease)&#xD;
