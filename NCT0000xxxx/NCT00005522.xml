      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social dominance, the tendency to exercise social influence and control, has been positively&#xD;
      associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk among males, independent of biomedical risk&#xD;
      factors and hostility. Exposure to dominant others behaviors also has been associated with&#xD;
      elevated CHD risk. For females, submissiveness and a constellation of psychosocial behaviors&#xD;
      opposite to urgency and competitiveness have been associated with increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). The studies extend a growing literature concerning the central&#xD;
      role of social relationships in health and illness and they test a theoretical model that&#xD;
      addresses why social relationships and interpersonally-oriented person variables such as&#xD;
      dominance may have differing consequences for the physical well-being of men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three studies were designed to test a social-contextual model of dominance and&#xD;
      cardiovascular stress reactivity (CVR) that synthesized and elaborated earlier models in&#xD;
      order to account for (1) cardiovascular consequences of exposure to dominant others and (2)&#xD;
      differences in dominant men's and women's cardiovascular responses to social interactions.&#xD;
      Because of the disproportionately high rates of CVD among Black Americans, both Black and&#xD;
      white men and women were included in the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a laboratory social interaction paradigm, study 1 refined and validated a coding system&#xD;
      designed to assess dominant and hostile behaviors during dyadic social interaction. Study 2&#xD;
      examined two factors proposed to account for differences in dominant men's and women's&#xD;
      cardiovascular responses to social interaction: (1) explicit role demands regarding dominance&#xD;
      expression (i.e., the degree to which situations provided clear and salient cues regarding&#xD;
      expected and acceptable behavior) and (2) gender composition of the dyad (i.e., same sex&#xD;
      versus opposite sex). These two factors were manipulated independently while unacquainted,&#xD;
      healthy young adult men and women participated in task-oriented dyadic discussions designed&#xD;
      to activate motives to influence; cardiovascular responses were measured during the&#xD;
      discussions and preceding rests. Study 3, a secondary analysis of data collected in study 2,&#xD;
      examined associations between CVR and exposure to others' dominance. The aforementioned&#xD;
      behavioral coding system was used to assess behavioral dominance observed in study 2 and path&#xD;
      analytic techniques were used to model associations among CVR, one's own and one's partner's&#xD;
      trait and behavioral dominance, gender, and situational factors.&#xD;
