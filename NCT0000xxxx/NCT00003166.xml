    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bryostatin-1 when given&#xD;
      together with vincristine in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia,&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to&#xD;
      stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may&#xD;
      kill more cancer cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of bryostatin 1 as a 24 hour infusion and&#xD;
      vincristine when administered sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of this combination on programmed cell death (apoptosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the immunomodulatory effect of bryostatin 1. IV. To observe patients for&#xD;
      clinical antitumor response after giving combination bryostatin 1 and vincristine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bryostatin 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours followed immediately by vincristine IV.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients completing 6 courses of therapy may receive subsequent courses every 3&#xD;
      weeks and then every 4 weeks after 24 months of treatment. Patients may return to a 2- or&#xD;
      3-week treatment course at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin 1 until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 1&#xD;
      of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
