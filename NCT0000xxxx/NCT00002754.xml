      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver&#xD;
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to determine the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients who have primary or metastatic melanoma or brain tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of iodine-131-labeled&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody fragment ME1-14 F(ab')2 administered intracystically in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or newly diagnosed primary or metastatic malignant melanoma or other brain tumors.&#xD;
      II. Identify any objective therapeutic responses to this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: All patients receive a fixed dose of monoclonal antibody fragment ME1-14 F(ab')2 via&#xD;
      an intralesional catheter; cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of isotope&#xD;
      conjugated to the antibody until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed disease at entry may receive additional therapy with external-beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy beginning 4 months after radioimmunotherapy (or sooner if disease progression&#xD;
      occurs). Patients with recurrent disease at entry are followed without further therapy for at&#xD;
      least 4 months after radioimmunotherapy; alternative therapy may be offered upon progression.&#xD;
      All patients are followed at 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment, then every 12 weeks for&#xD;
      1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to six patients will be entered at each dose studied.&#xD;
