  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of an experimental drug called EMD 128130 on Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of&#xD;
      long-term treatment with levodopa. EMD 128130 inhibits the function of serotonin, a chemical&#xD;
      messenger thought to regulate dopamine release, and thus affect Parkinson's disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease between 30 and 80 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this 3-phase study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 - Baseline Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history, physical examination, detailed neurologic&#xD;
      evaluation, routine blood tests, urinalysis and an electrocardiogram. A chest X-ray and MRI&#xD;
      or CT scan of the brain will be done if needed. In addition, an ACTH stimulation test will be&#xD;
      done before and at the end of the study. For this test, a hormone called ACTH is injected&#xD;
      into a vein. A small amount of blood is drawn before the injection and 30 and 60 minutes&#xD;
      afterwards to measure levels of another hormone called cortisol. After these tests are&#xD;
      completed, patients will, if possible, stop taking all antiparkinsonian medications except&#xD;
      levodopa (Sinemet) for one month before the study begins and throughout its duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 - Levodopa and Apomorphine Dose Finding&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 1 to 3 days, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical center to undergo a levodopa&#xD;
      and apomorphine (a dopamine agonist) &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this procedure, patients&#xD;
      will stop taking Sinemet and instead will have levodopa, and subsequently apomorphine,&#xD;
      infused through a vein. During the infusions, the drug dose will be increased slowly until&#xD;
      either 1) parkinsonian symptoms improve, 2) unacceptable side effects occur, or 3) the&#xD;
      maximum study dose is reached. Symptoms will be monitored frequently to find two infusion&#xD;
      rates: 1) one that is less than what is needed to relieve symptoms, and 2) one that relieves&#xD;
      symptoms but may produce dyskinesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3 - Active Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will begin the treatment phase within 3 months of the dose-finding phase. After a&#xD;
      brief physical examination, routine blood tests, and evaluation of parkinsonism symptoms,&#xD;
      patients will begin taking either EMD 128130 tablets or capsules or a placebo (a look-alike&#xD;
      pill with no active ingredient) twice a day, along with Sinemet, for 3 weeks. All&#xD;
      participants will receive placebo at least 1 week during the study, and about four patients,&#xD;
      selected at random, will receive only placebo the entire 3 weeks. Levodopa and apomorphine&#xD;
      infusions will be repeated at the end of weeks 1, 2 and 3 of Phase 3. The procedure for the&#xD;
      infusions will be the same as in the dose-finding phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, parkinsonian symptoms and dyskinesias will be assessed and blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn periodically to measure drug levels. Patients will return for a&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation 2 weeks after the end of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of a selective agonist of&#xD;
      serotonin 5-HT1A receptors on the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated&#xD;
      motor response complications in patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease. In a&#xD;
      controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of EMD 128130 will be assessed&#xD;
      through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of&#xD;
      frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;

        Females must be either at least one year post-menopausal, or using an adequate&#xD;
        contraceptive method for at least one month prior to and during participation in this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will carry the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease based on the presence&#xD;
        of a characteristic clinical history and neurologic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will have relatively advanced disease with levodopa-associated motor response&#xD;
        complications, including peak-dose dyskinesias and wearing-off fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be&#xD;
        expected to subject the patient to unwarranted risk will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities including liver enzyme&#xD;
        elevations more than two times the upper limit of normal will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are unable to be treated with levodopa/carbidopa alone or with a single,&#xD;
        relatively short-acting dopamine agonist will be excluded.&#xD;
