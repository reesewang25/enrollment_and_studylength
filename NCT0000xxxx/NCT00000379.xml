  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD): fluoxetine (an antidepressant) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing&#xD;
      (EMDR, a psychological treatment in which the patient is led through the memory of a&#xD;
      traumatic experience in order to heal him/herself).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a variety of therapies used to treat PTSD, but the effectiveness of medication&#xD;
      alone vs an exposure treatment, such as EMDR, has not been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to one of three groups for 8 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment. Group 1 will receive fluoxetine; Group 2 will receive EMDR; and Group 3 will&#xD;
      receive inactive placebo. Patients will then stop treatment and have evaluations, including&#xD;
      psychological tests, at the time treatment is stopped, 8 weeks later, and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual may be eligible for this study if he/she:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Has PTSD and is 18 to 65 years old.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the short-term and long-term efficacy of two different treatment approaches in&#xD;
      widespread use in clinical settings for treating patients with post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD): fluoxetine (which acts directly on biological systems) vs a psychological treatment,&#xD;
      Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). To clarify: 1) the differential&#xD;
      treatment effects of these different treatment modalities; 2) whether symptom improvement is&#xD;
      accompanied by changes in pathophysiology; and 3) the long-term effectiveness of these&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years a variety of treatment approaches have been shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of PTSD. These include prolonged exposure therapies (PE), stress inoculation&#xD;
      training (SIT), EMDR and psychopharmacological treatment with serotonin re-uptake blockers.&#xD;
      While PE has been compared with SIT and a study is currently under way comparing&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment with EMDR, no study as yet has compared the relative merits of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy alone vs an exposure treatment. While it is commonly held that, in order to&#xD;
      recover, people with PTSD need to &quot;process&quot; their traumatic memories, treatments that do not&#xD;
      involve the processing of traumatic memories (such as SIT or pharmacotherapy) may be just as&#xD;
      effective. In clinical practice, many patients with PTSD appear to be effectively treated&#xD;
      with pharmacological agents alone, without trauma-focused therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) a double-blind&#xD;
      psychopharmacological treatment (fluoxetine); 2) a manualized treatment which focuses on&#xD;
      &quot;processing&quot; traumatic memories (EMDR); or 3) a placebo control group. After 8 weeks of&#xD;
      active treatment, subjects are evaluated, cease treatment, and are assessed again after&#xD;
      another 8 weeks and at 6 months in order to evaluate the long-term effects. Training raters&#xD;
      remain blind to the subjects' treatment condition throughout the study. Treatment outcome is&#xD;
      assessed with a multi-modal psychological and biological assessment battery including: 1)&#xD;
      standard psychological tests for PTSD (CAPS); 2) neuroendocrine function (cortisol); and 3)&#xD;
      psychophysiological response to traumatic scripts (pre-post changes in heart social and&#xD;
      occupational functioning). Treatment adherence is monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
