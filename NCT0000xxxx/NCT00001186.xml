  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer has an enormous impact on the psychological and social well-being of the family&#xD;
           unit. The life-threatening connotations of cancer single out the ill child from his&#xD;
           peer/family group as one who is different, and often unable to maintain a normal&#xD;
           lifestyle. Physical sequelae of cancer and its treatment accentuate the differences&#xD;
           between these children and their normal peers/siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is important that children with cancer be prepared to function outside of protected&#xD;
           situations and begin to develop skills of separation and independence. For healthy&#xD;
           children, some of these latter skills are acquired by a camping experience. Such an&#xD;
           experience for the patient with cancer is frequently precluded by their dependence on&#xD;
           medical facilities and the physical limitations of their activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The goal of this study will be to assess the short and long term benefits of the&#xD;
           &quot;normalized&quot; camping experience, provided in conjunction with Special Love, Inc., on the&#xD;
           patients and staff. In particular, we will seek to determine whether such a&#xD;
           comprehensive experience is capable of influencing the attitudes and life experiences of&#xD;
           patients and staff in a positive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the impact of an enriched normalized camping experience on the quality of life&#xD;
      of the pediatric cancer patient. In particular, attempts will be made to measure the manner&#xD;
      in which this experience influences the child's sense of well-being and self-esteem as well&#xD;
      as his or her relationship with parents, family, and peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children 7-17 years of age who are currently being treated for cancer or are up to 3&#xD;
           years post therapy OR Young adults with cancer (YACers) 18-25 years of age who are&#xD;
           acting as counselors at Camp Fantastic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All children/young adults will be selected for camp after careful screening by a&#xD;
           multidisciplinary committee consisting of medical and program directors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the discretion of the multidisciplinary committee consisting of medical and program&#xD;
           directors, special exceptions may be made for children with extenuating circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of benefit may include interviews with children and families before, during&#xD;
           and following camp. Observational data on the child's performance at camp will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and nursing personnel will consist of staff from the Pediatric Branch at the&#xD;
           NCI, other units within the NIH, and participating institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Special Love members, the Program Director at the 4-H Center camp (site of the camp) and&#xD;
           Pediatric Branch staff at the NCI will coordinate the camp program, taking into account&#xD;
           the medical needs of each camper.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every attempt will be made to provide a full agenda of age appropriate activities for&#xD;
           the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The length of the camping experience for children with cancer will be for 7 days&#xD;
           beginning on a Sunday and extending through the following Saturday morning. Patients&#xD;
           will be transported to the camp from the NIH Clinical Center and the Virginia hospitals&#xD;
           by bus.&#xD;
