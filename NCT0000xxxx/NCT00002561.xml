      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.&#xD;
      Combining more than one drug or combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy, with&#xD;
      or without chemotherapy, with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with stage I or stage&#xD;
      IIA Hodgkin's disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the 12-year survival of patients with clinical stage I-IIA Hodgkin's&#xD;
      disease treated with radiotherapy with or without doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and&#xD;
      dacarbazine (ABVD) versus ABVD only. II. Compare the freedom from progression at 5 and 10&#xD;
      years in patients treated with these regimens. III. Compare the complete remission rate,&#xD;
      freedom from secondary disease progression at 5 and 10 years, and cause-specific survival at&#xD;
      5, 10, and 15 years in patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare the short- and&#xD;
      long-term toxicity of these regimens in these patients. V. Compare the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center. Patients&#xD;
      who are under age 40 and have lymphocyte-predominant or nodular sclerosing histology, an&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate less than 50, and fewer than 4 disease sites&#xD;
      (supradiaphragmatic or pelvic node sites) are assigned to cohort 1 (good prognosis). All&#xD;
      other patients are assigned to cohort 2 (poor prognosis). Cohort 1: Arm I: Patients with&#xD;
      supradiaphragmatic disease undergo radiotherapy to the supradiaphragmatic lymph node areas&#xD;
      (mantle region), spleen, and para-aortic lymph nodes 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Patients with&#xD;
      pelvic disease undergo radiotherapy to an &quot;inverted-Y&quot; field (excluding the spleen) 5 days a&#xD;
      week for 4 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and&#xD;
      dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15 (ABVD). Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a total of 2&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) after course 2 receive 2 additional courses past CR. Patients with&#xD;
      partial remission (PR) after course 2 receive 4 additional courses past PR. Patients with&#xD;
      unconfirmed/uncertain complete remission (CRu) receive 2-4 additional courses past CRu.&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Arm III: Patients receive ABVD as in arm II, followed 4-6 weeks later by concurrent&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the mantle region and upper abdomen to the level of L2 5 days a week for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Alternatively, radiotherapy may also be administered sequentially to the mantle region&#xD;
      5 days a week for 4 weeks and then to the upper abdomen to the level of L2 5 days a week for&#xD;
      4 weeks. Arm IV: Patients receive ABVD only as in arm II. Patients with disease progression&#xD;
      after treatment in arms II or IV are considered for radiotherapy. Quality of life is assessed&#xD;
      on day 1 of each course of chemotherapy (arms II-IV) and on day 28 of the last course of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (arms II and IV); on the first and final days of radiotherapy (arms I and III);&#xD;
      at 4 weeks and at 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of radiotherapy (arms I and III) or&#xD;
      chemotherapy (arms II and IV); and then annually for 2-10 years. Patients are followed at&#xD;
      months 3, 6, and 12 and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5 years.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven Hodgkin's Disease. A needle aspirate specimen will not be&#xD;
             considered sufficient for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologic material must have been reviewed by a designated local reference&#xD;
             pathologist (LRP) prior to randomization. Histologic subtype determined by the LRP&#xD;
             will be used for patient cohort assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have clinical stage I - IIA disease according to Ann Arbor staging&#xD;
             criteria. Clinical stage must be based on at least one tissue biopsy. The following&#xD;
             aspects are to be considered in determining patient stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) Splenic Enlargement: Splenic enlargement determined by imaging studies only should&#xD;
             not be considered evidence of splenic involvement with Hodgkin's disease. Patients&#xD;
             should be considered as having splenic involvement if the spleen is palpable on&#xD;
             physical examination and enlarged on imaging studies, or imaging studies show focal&#xD;
             abnormalities consistent with Hodgkin's disease. These patients, if presenting with&#xD;
             supradiaphragmatic disease would therefore be assessed as having Stage III disease and&#xD;
             would be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii) Bone Disease: Lytic or blastic lesions seen on plain radiographs or abnormalities on&#xD;
        bone scan consistent with Hodgkin's disease will be considered as bone involvement with&#xD;
        Hodgkin's disease. These patients would therefore be assessed as having Stage IV disease&#xD;
        and would be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii) Pleural Effusion and Ascites: The presence of a pleural effusion or ascites will be&#xD;
        considered as evidence of Hodgkin's disease even if cytological examination is negative.&#xD;
        These patients would be assessed as having probable Stage IV disease and therefore would be&#xD;
        ineligible. Patients assessed on Xray as having pleural thickening or &quot;blunting&quot; of the&#xD;
        costophrenic angle only may be eligible. iv) Extra-nodal vs. Stage IV Disease: Patients&#xD;
        with disease involving a single extra-nodal site may be considered as &quot;limited-stage&quot;&#xD;
        provided all disease can be included in a standard radiation field. Patients with&#xD;
        extra-nodal disease that cannot be included in such a field (eg, lung, bone) or with&#xD;
        multiple sites of extra-nodal disease are not eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary function tests must be done in patients with symptomatic lung disease. FVC,&#xD;
             FEV-1 and DLCO must be ≥ 60% of predicted value. Patients with asthma controlled by&#xD;
             medication are eligible if the above criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's age is ≥ 16 years. (Note that the lower age limit at each centre will be&#xD;
             determined by that centre's policy regarding the age at which an individual may sign&#xD;
             their own consent.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have received previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        granulocytes ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (S.I.) or ≥ 1.5 x 103/uL (U.S.) platelets ≥ 125 x 109/L (S.I.)&#xD;
        or ≥ 125 x 103/uL (U.S.) bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x UNL (unless due to hemolytic anemia) serum&#xD;
        creatinine ≤ 2 x UNL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have been seen by both a radiation oncologist and medical oncologist who&#xD;
             agree the patient is able to receive protocol radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient consent must be obtained according to local Institutional and/or University&#xD;
             Human Experimentation Committee requirements. It will be the responsibility of the&#xD;
             local participating investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance, and to&#xD;
             indicate in writing to the NCIC CTG Clinical Trials Coordinator that such clearance&#xD;
             has been obtained, before the trial can commence in that centre. Because of differing&#xD;
             requirements, a standard consent form for the trial will not be provided but a sample&#xD;
             form is given. The patient must sign the consent form prior to randomization. Please&#xD;
             note that the consent form for this study must contain a statement which gives&#xD;
             permission for the NCICCTG and monitoring agencies to review patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of patient for follow-up and quality of life (QoL) assessments. Patients&#xD;
             must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Investigators must assure themselves&#xD;
             that patients registered on this trial will be available for complete documentation of&#xD;
             the treatment, toxicity and follow-up. Comparison of quality of life is an end-point&#xD;
             of this study. Patients must have completed the pre-randomization quality of life&#xD;
             assessment and be willing to complete future assessments. The only exceptions will be&#xD;
             patients who are unable to read english or french. Patients on study are expected to&#xD;
             complete all the quality of life assessments but, should this not prove possible, they&#xD;
             will be retained in the study for all other analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ineligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or concurrent malignancies, except adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the skin. (Patients with prior carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix are not eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac disease defined as symptomatic congestive heart failure or coronary artery&#xD;
             disease, known valvular (other than asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse) or congenital&#xD;
             heart disease (other than asymptomatic atrial septal defects) or need for cardiac&#xD;
             medications. Hypertension controlled with drug therapy is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other major medical illness judged likely by the local investigator to preclude safe&#xD;
             administration of protocol treatment or required follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with stage IA disease (who might be treated with involved-field only&#xD;
             irradiation) defined by meeting all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) lymphocyte predominant or nodular sclerosing histology ii) disease bulk &lt; 3 cm iii)&#xD;
             erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &lt; 50 iv) unilateral high - neck only disease,&#xD;
             defined as disease located above the upper border of the thyroid cartilage or isolated&#xD;
             epitrochlear adenopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with very unfavourable clinical stage I-IIA disease defined as bulky&#xD;
             adenopathy. Bulky adenopathy is defined as a palpable nodal mass greater than 10 cm.&#xD;
             in diameter or a mediastinal mass with a maximum mass diameter measuring greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 1/3 the maximum chest wall diameter (see Appendix III).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with intra-abdominal disease. (Patients with pelvic disease: ileofemoral,&#xD;
             inguinal or parailiac nodes are eligible for this study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with B symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to have a positive antibody test for the human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) or who have a clinical diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. HIV&#xD;
             testing is not a requirement for study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone a staging laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant. Note: men and women of childbearing age must be&#xD;
