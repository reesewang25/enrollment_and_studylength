      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies indicate that high carbohydrate intake may exacerbate the dyslipidemia often&#xD;
      seen with insulin resistance. Consequently, there is much debate as to the optimal dietary&#xD;
      pattern for individuals with NIDDM to minimize risk for microvascular disease. Data on this&#xD;
      topic from free-living populations are scarce. In addition, associations of dietary&#xD;
      antioxidants with CVD risk have not been evaluated in large community samples of persons with&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential dietary determinants of hyperinsulinemia or of insulin resistance were evaluated,&#xD;
      including high intake of dietary fats and of simple sugars and low alcohol consumption. As a&#xD;
      major focus, dietary factors that may contribute to elevated CVD risk among persons with&#xD;
      existing insulin resistance, including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and&#xD;
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were examined. Five datasets from&#xD;
      epidemiologic studies were available to evaluate specific hypotheses for men and women of&#xD;
      Black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnicity. The unique contributions of each dataset&#xD;
      were as follows. The San Luis Valley Diabetes Study and the San Antonio Heart Study enabled&#xD;
      prospective analyses for large numbers of subjects with IGT or NIDDM; the Mexico City Study&#xD;
      provided a sample with contrasting dietary patterns in a non-white population; the Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente Women Twins Study allowed for the removal of genetic influences by evaluating&#xD;
      associations within monozygotic twin pairs; and the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study&#xD;
      (IRAS) provided direct measurement of insulin sensitivity and subclinical atherosclerosis&#xD;
      across the spectrum of glucose tolerance in three ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An understanding of the accuracy of the dietary assessment instruments used in the three&#xD;
      ethnic groups was critical to the interpretation of the findings related to diet and CVD risk&#xD;
      variables. Therefore, a second component of research was also conducted, that being an&#xD;
      evaluation of the comparative validity of the food frequency interview used in the multi-&#xD;
      cultural IRAS population using a series of 24-hour dietary recalls as the standard.&#xD;
