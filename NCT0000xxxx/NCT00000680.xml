      1) To determine whether it is possible to remove and culture (increase in number and&#xD;
      activate) in the laboratory, CD8(+) lymphocytes (white blood cells) from HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients receiving zidovudine (AZT); 2) To determine the toxicity of returning to the&#xD;
      patients intravenously the expanded and activated autologous cells (given to the patient from&#xD;
      whom they were taken), with and without giving the patients recombinant interleukin-2 (&#xD;
      aldesleukin; IL-2 ) at the same time; 3) To radiolabel (mark) the CD8(+) lymphocytes with&#xD;
      Indium 111, and then scan the patients to determine the distribution of the CD8(+)&#xD;
      lymphocytes in those who are and are not given IL-2 infusions; 4) To determine the toxicity&#xD;
      of IL-2 given at the same time with autologous CD8(+) lymphocytes; 5) To measure changes in&#xD;
      the immunology of the subjects following these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD8(+) cells are suppressor/killer lymphocyte cells that act to limit replication of viruses.&#xD;
      It is hoped that the reinfusion of activated autologous CD8(+) cells into patients with AIDS&#xD;
      will help to control opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis (two&#xD;
      of the leading causes of sickness and death in AIDS patients). This treatment may also stop&#xD;
      the HIV virus from replicating (reproducing itself) in the AIDS patient. Further activation&#xD;
      of these cells, once infused, may be necessary. It is hoped that IL-2 will stimulate the&#xD;
      patient's immune system against the AIDS virus along with the activated CD8(+) cells. Thus,&#xD;
      IL-2 will be given, and its effects studied.&#xD;

&#xD;
      AMENDED: 09/28/90 The CD8 lymphocytes are grown in vitro for 21 days before infusion.&#xD;
      Leukapheresis and infusion continue every 21 days for 3 infusions with the last infusion&#xD;
      during week 16. During weeks 13 and 16, indium 111 radio labelled cells are injected to&#xD;
      permit determination of the distribution and pharmacokinetics of the infused cells. At week&#xD;
      16, IL-2 is administered concurrently with Indium 111 labelled cells and the CD8+ lymphocytes&#xD;
      - delivered by continuous infusion over 5 days following cell infusion. Patients are followed&#xD;
      at the clinic 1 week prior to scheduled infusions, during infusion weeks and then every 2&#xD;
      weeks to week 21 and at week 27. Original design: Patients undergo leukapheresis every 2&#xD;
      weeks for a total of 6 times during the initial phase of the study. During this procedure, a&#xD;
      catheter is placed in an arm vein, and the blood flows through a machine which separates the&#xD;
      lymphocytes from the other blood components. The blood is then returned to the patient's body&#xD;
      through the catheter. Less than 10 percent of the lymphocytes in the blood are removed during&#xD;
      the process. The CD8(+) cells taken from the patient are cultured in the laboratory until&#xD;
      they increase 10- to 1000-fold. These cells are then infused back into the patient from whom&#xD;
      they were taken. The first two patients are admitted for 24 hours at the time of each&#xD;
      infusion. In the absence of severe side effects, the subsequent four patients are infused at&#xD;
      the clinic. Patients are admitted for 5 days for continuous infusion of IL-2 in week 13.&#xD;
