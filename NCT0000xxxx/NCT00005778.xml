    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment with the &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot; treatment, monthly intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, in people with moderate to&#xD;
      severe lupus that does not respond to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. We will give patients&#xD;
      either IV cyclophosphamide (750 milligrams per square meter of body surface area) monthly for&#xD;
      6 months, followed by quarterly maintenance therapy, or high-dose IV cyclophosphamide (50&#xD;
      milligrams per kilogram body weight per day) for the first four days of the study. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 24 months after therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) remains the prototypic autoimmune disease. Recent&#xD;
      data show that its incidence has tripled since 1970 and its prevalence is 1 in 800 in&#xD;
      Rochester, Minnesota. The natural history of lupus in our cohort is one of (1) relapsing/&#xD;
      remitting or (2) chronic activity, with only 17 percent of patients having periods of long&#xD;
      quiescence. Over 75 percent of our African-American patients and 50 percent of our Caucasian&#xD;
      patients have renal (kidney) involvement. Over 50 percent suffer permanent damage in one or&#xD;
      more organ systems, and over 15 percent have renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have shown that, for patients with&#xD;
      severe lupus, especially with renal involvement, monthly IV pulse cyclophosphamide (500 to&#xD;
      1000 mg/m squared BSA) for 6 months followed by quarterly maintenance for 2 years is superior&#xD;
      to high-dose corticosteroid treatment. NIH and others have shown that IV pulse&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide is also effective for severe lupus in other organs. However, even monthly IV&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide is not successful in all cases, and it, too, has associated toxicity,&#xD;
      especially premature ovarian failure. For that reason, we have pioneered the use of high-dose&#xD;
      immunoablative cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) in 10 patients with severe lupus refractory to&#xD;
      other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the initial success of this approach, including 75 percent complete response (on&#xD;
      no medications) in renal lupus, we are conducting a controlled trial of high-dose&#xD;
      immunoablative cyclophosphamide versus the &quot;gold standard&quot; monthly IV cyclophosphamide in&#xD;
      people with moderate to severe lupus refractory to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. We will&#xD;
      give patients either 750 mg/m2 of body surface area IV cyclophosphamide monthly for 6 months,&#xD;
      followed by quarterly maintenance therapy (we will readmit patients, if necessary, for&#xD;
      infections or other complications) or cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/d intravenously on days 1-4.&#xD;
      We will calculate the dose of cyclophosphamide according to ideal body weight. Patients are&#xD;
      scheduled to receive only one course of therapy. We will follow patients according to the&#xD;
      infective guidelines for BMT.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All patients with moderate-to-severe SLE will be considered for this trial, including women&#xD;
        and minorities. SLE is too rare a disease in children for it to be feasible to include&#xD;
        them. Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible for participation in this&#xD;
        clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Four or more ACR criteria (90), as revised by Hochberg (91) for the classification of&#xD;
             SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involvement of one or more of the following organ systems (renal, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematologic, cardiac, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal) of moderate-to-severe&#xD;
             severity as indicated by an &quot;A&quot; score on the BILAG, a &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot; for severity on SLAM,&#xD;
             or severe enough to require hospitalization if the organ involvement was not&#xD;
             &quot;captured&quot; on either the BILAG or SLAM instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A lack of response to daily corticosteroids in moderate-to-high doses (0.5 -1 mg&#xD;
             prednisone/kg/day or equivalent anti-inflammatory dose of methyprednisolone,&#xD;
             dexamethasone, or triamicinolone). When cyclophosphamide is the accepted standard of&#xD;
             care (renal and neurologic), the maximally tolerated dose of prednisone will be&#xD;
             sufficient to meet the corticosteroid criterion. The ideal body weight will be used&#xD;
             for this criterion in patients who are morbidly obese. The equivalent dose of&#xD;
             triamcinolone (4mg triamcinolone=5mg prednisone) can be used to meet the criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        And/or:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A lack of response to IV pulse corticosteroids (1 gram methylprednisolone or 180 mg&#xD;
             dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Duration of treatment to determine lack of response is 3 days or longer for&#xD;
             neurologic, renal, hematologic, pulmonary, or cardiac lupus, one month or longer for&#xD;
             serositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        And/or:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Equivalent degree of immunosuppression with azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporin,&#xD;
             or mycophenolate mofetil. Equivalent degrees of immunosuppression are: azathioprine -&#xD;
             100 mg daily or more; methotrexate - 7.5 mg weekly or more; cyclosporin - 150 mg daily&#xD;
             or more; mycophenolate mofetil - 1000 mg daily or more. Duration to determine lack of&#xD;
             response should be one month or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        And/or:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appropriate other treatment (such as intravenous immunoglobulin for hemolytic anemia&#xD;
             and thrombocytopenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SLE patients seeking treatment for neurological complaints will be evaluated by a&#xD;
             neurologist to concur that the patient meets eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appropriate other treatment for cutaneous lupus patients may include combination&#xD;
             antimalarial drugs (such as the combination of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with&#xD;
             quinacrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may enter the trial if they received one dose of IV cyclophosphamide to&#xD;
             &quot;temporize&quot; or &quot;stablize&quot; them prior to screening visit or after signing consent or if&#xD;
             previous IV cyclophosphamide was for a PAST organ system, and patient presents with&#xD;
             NEW organ system requiring IV cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insurance or other source of funds to pay for expenses related to this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exlcusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age less than 18 years and over 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any risk of pregnancy - ALL female patients must have an effective means of birth&#xD;
             control or be infertile due to hysterectomy, fallopian tube surgery, or menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous completion of the NIH IV cyclophosphamide protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 45%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FVC or FEV &lt; 50% predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &gt; 2.0, transaminases &gt; 2x normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are preterminal or moribund.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SLE patients presenting with arthritis for entry organ system.&#xD;
