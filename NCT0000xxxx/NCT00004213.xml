      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde&#xD;
      thiosemicarbazone in treating patients who have solid tumors that have not responded to&#xD;
      previous treatment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effects of 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone&#xD;
      (3-AP) in patients with solid tumors by evaluating the safety and tolerability, maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for Phase II studies, pharmacokinetics, and tumor&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde&#xD;
      thiosemicarbazone (3-AP) IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of 3-AP until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is&#xD;
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients are followed for 4 weeks or until recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
