  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To define the toxicity and maximum-tolerated dose of weekly oral etoposide (VP-16) in&#xD;
      patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma; to determine the clinical pharmacology of orally&#xD;
      administered VP-16 in AIDS patients. A secondary objective is to obtain preliminary data for&#xD;
      determining the effect of oral VP-16 on Kaposi's sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VP-16 is an antitumor agent. Previous problems with VP-16 include the route of administration&#xD;
      and the toxicities. VP-16 has been given intravenously for 3 consecutive days in a 21-day&#xD;
      cycle for lung cancer and testicular cancer. VP-16 has also been used in lymphoma therapy.&#xD;
      Oral VP-16 would eliminate the need for an intravenous catheter and so a patient could avoid&#xD;
      the pain, inconvenience, and potential complications associated with medications administered&#xD;
      intravenously. The relative ease of outpatient administration and the potentially significant&#xD;
      antitumor activity of oral VP-16 motivates this study. The possibility of weekly drug&#xD;
      administration is the other focus of this study.&#xD;

      administration is the other focus of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four patients are entered at each dose level starting with level 1. Patients are not entered&#xD;
      into the next higher dose level until at least two patients at the previous dose level have&#xD;
      completed at least 3 weeks of therapy with grade 2 or less maximum tolerated dose-defining&#xD;
      toxicities. Treatment is repeated weekly for 52 weeks until either a grade 3 or 4 toxicity&#xD;
      occurs, or until a patient shows a complete response or progressive disease. Patients with a&#xD;
      complete response are continued on drug for 4 additional weeks from the time that complete&#xD;
      response is first documented. Patients with progressive disease are withdrawn from study.&#xD;
      Patients with partial response or stable disease continue until either unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      occurs or a complete response or progression of disease is reached.&#xD;
