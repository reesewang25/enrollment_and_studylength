  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with pediatric eye diseases,&#xD;
      particularly amblyopia and strabismus. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments;&#xD;
      rather, patients will receive current standard of care treatments. The purpose of the study&#xD;
      is twofold: 1) to allow National Eye Institute physicians to increase their knowledge of&#xD;
      inflammatory eye conditions and identify possible new avenues of research in this area; and&#xD;
      2) to establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are developed.&#xD;
      (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision will be&#xD;
      voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients age 6 months and older with pediatric eye diseases, including amblyopia, strabismus,&#xD;
      cataracts, glaucoma, and developmental abnormalities may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history, eye examination, and diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures that may include routine laboratory testing, X-rays, questionnaires, physical&#xD;
      examination, and other standard or specialized tests or procedures as needed. The eye&#xD;
      examination includes measurements of eye pressure and visual acuity (ability to see the&#xD;
      vision chart), examination of the pupils and eye movements, and dilation of the pupils to&#xD;
      examine the lens and retina. In addition, patients will undergo a procedure to record eye&#xD;
      movements called oculography, in which special detectors measure infrared light reflected off&#xD;
      the patient's eyes while he or she watches lights on a computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for at least 3 years. Visits will be scheduled from 1 to 6&#xD;
      times a year, according to the standard of care for the individual patient's eye problem.&#xD;
      Vision will be checked at each visit, and some of the screening tests described above may be&#xD;
      repeated to follow the progress of disease and evaluate the response to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to allow the pediatric and strabismus specialists at the&#xD;
      National Eye Institute to gain additional knowledge of the course of various pediatric eye&#xD;
      diseases and strabismus and to evaluate the effects of standard treatments for these&#xD;
      diseases. This understanding may lead to ideas for future protocols. This protocol will also&#xD;
      allow for the maintenance of populations of patients with specific pediatric eye diseases and&#xD;
      strabismus that may be eligible for future protocols. In addition, by allowing for the care&#xD;
      of persons with a spectrum of these diseases, the protocol will be valuable for the training&#xD;
      of pediatric eye disease and ocular motility fellows. The pediatric and eye movement&#xD;
      specialists at the National Eye Institute are free to choose those diseases that interest&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments. Any evaluations or treatment under&#xD;
      this protocol will be based on the current standard of care for each pediatric or ocular&#xD;
      motor disease. All alternatives for evaluation and care will be reviewed with each patient,&#xD;
      and the patient's family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for potential&#xD;
      eligibility in any new NEI clinical trials or epidemiological protocols as they are&#xD;
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However,&#xD;
      they will not be required to enter any new protocol and their decision to participate will be&#xD;
      entirely voluntary.&#xD;

        Must have a disorder of ocular motility or a pediatric specific eye disease.&#xD;
