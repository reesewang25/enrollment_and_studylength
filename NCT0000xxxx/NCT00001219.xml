  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are diagnostic&#xD;
      tests that allow researchers to look at different chemical properties of tissue. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging and spectroscopy studies can be used to gather or evaluate information&#xD;
      about various aspects of patient s bodies or to monitor changes in the biochemistry and&#xD;
      physiology of patient s bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike other diagnostic techniques (CT scan and PET scan) MRI and MRS do not use ionizing&#xD;
      radiation. Some studies have shown that MRI is more effective at distinguishing normal parts&#xD;
      of the anatomy from abnormal anatomy, especially in the brain. MRI has become the diagnostic&#xD;
      test of choice for evaluating patient with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate normal volunteers and patients with a variety of&#xD;
      diseases with magnetic resonance imaging. Researchers will attempt different magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging methods and techniques as well as different levels of magnetic strength.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is a constantly evolving imaging modality. Pulse sequences are often modified to improve&#xD;
      their performance. However, many of these changes have not yet been approved by the FDA and&#xD;
      therefore, are not considered standard of care. Some of these sequences require the use of&#xD;
      new types of imaging coils, which are also investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major purpose of this protocol is to inform patients undergoing MR scans in the Clinical&#xD;
      Center that they be scanned with MRI sequences and/or coils which may or may not be FDA&#xD;
      approved and to get the patient s consent for this. This is not a formal research study since&#xD;
      specific disease entities and specific pulse sequences are not studied in a systematic way.&#xD;
      Rather, the purpose is to give NIH patients access to gradual improvements in MR technology&#xD;
      that would otherwise not be available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who, by virtue of the NIH protocol in which they are enrolled, qualify for MRI&#xD;
      will be eligible for participation in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 99,999 participants will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
