      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal cytarabine in treating young&#xD;
      patients who have recurrent or refractory meningeal leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the qualitative or quantitative toxic effects and tolerability of&#xD;
      liposomal cytarabine (Depofoam encapsulated cytarabine; DTC 101) in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory meningeal malignancies. II. Define a safe dose of DTC 101 in these&#xD;
      patients for future clinical studies. III. Determine the plasma and CSF pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      DTC 101 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients are placed in one of three&#xD;
      age-related strata: stratum 1, 3 to 21 years of age; stratum 2, at least 2 but less than 3&#xD;
      years of age; stratum 3, at least 1 but less than 2 years of age. Patients receive an&#xD;
      induction dose of intrathecal liposomal cytarabine (Depofoam encapsulated cytarabine; DTC&#xD;
      101) administered once every 2 weeks for 2 courses. Patients who have achieved a partial&#xD;
      response or received significant clinical benefit with stable disease may receive a third&#xD;
      induction dose of DTC 101, 2 weeks following the second dose. In the absence of progressive&#xD;
      disease, patients can proceed to consolidation therapy. During consolidation therapy,&#xD;
      intrathecal DTC 101 is administered once every 4 weeks for 2 courses, beginning 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the last induction dose. Patients experiencing a complete or significant response can proceed&#xD;
      to maintenance therapy. Patients receive a maintenance dose of intrathecal DTC 101 once every&#xD;
      8 weeks for a total of 6 doses, beginning 4 weeks after the second consolidation dose. At&#xD;
      least 3 patients are evaluated at each dose level. Dose escalation to the next level proceeds&#xD;
      when a minimum of 3 patients per cohort has successfully completed induction therapy and been&#xD;
      evaluated. Patients will be followed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post treatment, until&#xD;
      relapse or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12-15 patients will be accrued for each stratum over 18 to 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
