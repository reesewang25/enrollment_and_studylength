    <textblock>
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is a genetic disorder (autosomal recessive) caused by an&#xD;
      abnormality in the production of cholesterol. The disorder can occur in both a &quot;mild&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;severe&quot; form. SLOS is associated with multiple birth defects and mental retardation. Some of&#xD;
      the birth defects include; abnormal facial features, poor muscle tone, poor growth, shortened&#xD;
      life span, and abnormalities of the heart, lungs, brain, gastrointestinal tract, limbs,&#xD;
      genitalia, and kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no known cure for SLOS but recently patients have been treated with increased&#xD;
      amounts of cholesterol in their diet. The cholesterol in a persons diet is unable to correct&#xD;
      the abnormalities in the patient's organs, but researchers hope it will improve growth&#xD;
      failure and mental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was developed to answer questions about the causes and complications of SLOS, as&#xD;
      well as the effectiveness of cholesterol treatment. The study will enroll patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with SLOS, and their mothers. The objectives of the study will be to address the following&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt;TAB&gt; What is the prognosis / natural history of the demyelination in the nervous system&#xD;
           of patients with SLOS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &lt;TAB&gt; Do patients with SLOS have other problems concerning the function of their&#xD;
           endocrine systems?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &lt;TAB&gt;What are the genetic make-ups of patients with SLOS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. &lt;TAB&gt;Can further studies of cholesterol metabolism and genetic testing, using SLOS&#xD;
           fibroblasts, increase the understanding of SLOS?&lt;TAB&gt;...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive multiple congenital&#xD;
      anomaly/mental retardation syndrome. Typical clinical features include a distinctive facial&#xD;
      appearance, mental retardation, autistic behavior, hypotonia, failure to feed, poor growth,&#xD;
      decreased life span, and variable structural anomalies of the heart, lungs, brain,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, limbs, genitalia and kidneys. The SLOS phenotypic spectrum is broad&#xD;
      and variable. At the severe end of the spectrum SLOS is a lethal disorder with multiple major&#xD;
      congenital anomalies; whereas, mild cases of SLOS present with a combination of minor&#xD;
      physical stigmata, behavioral problems, and learning disabilities. SLOS is due to an inborn&#xD;
      error of cholesterol biosynthesis. Biochemically, SLOS patients have a deficiency of&#xD;
      3beta-hydroxysterol delta(7)-reductase activity. 3beta-hydroxysterol delta(7)-reductase is an&#xD;
      NADPH dependent microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of the C7(8) double bond of&#xD;
      7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to yield cholesterol in the last step of cholesterol&#xD;
      biosynthesis via the Kandutsch-Russel pathway. This inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis&#xD;
      results in elevated tissue and serum 7-DHC levels and typically decreased serum and tissue&#xD;
      cholesterol levels. In 1998 we established that the deficiency in 3beta-hydroxysterol&#xD;
      delta(7)-reductase activity is due to mutation of the 3beta-hydroxysterol delta(7)-reductase&#xD;
      gene (DHCR7). Once the biochemical defect in SLOS was identified, dietary cholesterol&#xD;
      supplementation was proposed and employed as a therapeutic approach. Although developmental&#xD;
      malformations remain fixed, dietary cholesterol supplementation appears to improve the&#xD;
      overall health of these patients, and initial results have shown that dietary cholesterol&#xD;
      supplementation has had a positive impact on some of the behavioral manifestations of this&#xD;
      disorder. Although our understanding of this disorder has advanced over the last few years,&#xD;
      many questions remain concerning the effectiveness of cholesterol replacement therapy, the&#xD;
      long term prognosis for individuals on dietary cholesterol supplementation, and the need for&#xD;
      adjunctive measures in the clinical management of SLOS patients. We propose to answer some of&#xD;
      these questions by continuing our longitudinal natural history/prognosis study on patients&#xD;
      with SLOS. We also plan on studying very closely related disorders such as lathosterolosis&#xD;
      under this protocol. Lathosterolosis is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sterol&#xD;
      3-beta-hydroxysteroid-delta-5-desaturase which is necessary for the conversion of lathosterol&#xD;
      into 7-DHC. The clinical picture is very similar to SLOS with prominent features including&#xD;
      microcephaly, ptosis bilateral 2,3 toe syndactyly. Lathosterolosis is also inherited in an&#xD;
      autosomal recessive manner. Lethosterolosis is extremely rare with only 4 cases described in&#xD;
      the literature so far and an estimated incidence of less than 1 in a million. The below&#xD;
      objectives, protocol evaluations, risks, benefits and other pertinent issues apply to SLOS&#xD;
      and lathosterolosis even if lathosterolosis is not explicitly named.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with biochemically confirmed SLOS will be accepted into this study.&#xD;
             Patients of any age, either gender, or any ethnicity will be accepted into this study.&#xD;
             No exclusions will be made based on race or gender. Historically, more males than&#xD;
             females have been diagnosed as having SLOS. This bias was likely a result of the fact&#xD;
             that genital hypoplasia is readily apparent in a male, and therefore the clinical&#xD;
             diagnosis is easier to make in a male patient. SLOS syndrome appears more commonly in&#xD;
             individuals of Northern European ancestry. Out of 150 biochemically proven cases, only&#xD;
             one was an African American and no patients of Asian descent were reported. One SLOS&#xD;
             mutant allele (R404C) appears to be present in individuals of French Canadian and&#xD;
             Creole heritage. This likely represents a founder effect. One puzzling finding is that&#xD;
             the carrier rate of the most common SLOS mutant allele in Black Canadians from Ontario&#xD;
             and African Americans from Pennsylvania appears to be approximately 0.7%. However,&#xD;
             clinical cases appear to be rare. The predominance of Caucasians reported in the&#xD;
             literature may represent a bias of ascertainment of the disorder, variable&#xD;
             presentation in different ethnic groups, or a founder effect in some ethnic groups.&#xD;
             Because we function as a referral center with respect to recruitment, the ethnic&#xD;
             background of our population is likely going to reflect the overall population of&#xD;
             diagnosed cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they cannot travel to the NIH because of their medical&#xD;
             condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women will be excluded, and a negative urine pregnancy test will be required&#xD;
             of menstruating women. This protocol focuses on biosampling. Increasing blood draws&#xD;
             during pregnancy for research is not appropriate. Fetuses will be excluded since the&#xD;
             proposed evaluations are not possible during fetal life.&#xD;
