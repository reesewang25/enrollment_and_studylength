      The purpose of this study is to see if adding an HIV vaccine (ALVAC-HIV vCP1452), IL-2&#xD;
      (interleukin-2, a protein found in the blood that helps boost the immune system), or both to&#xD;
      anti-HIV-drug therapy is safe, tolerable, and effective in controlling viral load (level of&#xD;
      HIV in the body). (This study has been changed to clarify drug name.) Anti-HIV drugs can help&#xD;
      reduce a patient's viral load. However, HIV can still remain in CD4 cells (cells of the&#xD;
      immune system that help fight infection). Combining an HIV vaccine, IL-2, or both with&#xD;
      anti-HIV drugs may help reduce the number of HIV-infected cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The most important goal for designing future therapeutic interventions is to understand the&#xD;
      nature of persistent HIV infection in patients successfully treated with potent&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy and to develop strategies to promote the clearance of these reservoirs&#xD;
      or at least long-term suppression of these reservoirs. If latently infected cells are able to&#xD;
      persist for a long period (despite effective suppression of de novo infection) primarily&#xD;
      because immune clearance is not being adequately stimulated by viral antigen, then&#xD;
      HIV-specific immunization is a reasonable strategy to enhance the clearance of these cells.&#xD;
      Stimulating effective HIV-specific cellular immune responses at a time when plasma viremia is&#xD;
      maximally suppressed also may contribute to the long-term containment of HIV replication on&#xD;
      potent antiretroviral therapy. A second component to be evaluated in this trial is whether&#xD;
      broad, cyclical activation of T cells with IL-2 will increase the activation of HIV proviral&#xD;
      gene expression and thereby render target cells susceptible to immune-mediated clearance.&#xD;
      This pathogenesis-based clinical trial will explore the potential for these novel treatment&#xD;
      strategies (HIV-specific immunization and IL-2, alone and in combination) to complement the&#xD;
      effects of potent antiretroviral therapy by promoting more effective immunologic control of&#xD;
      HIV-1 replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into 3 steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP I: Patients continue to receive their stable potent antiretroviral therapy and are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 4 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Vaccine placebo [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: ALVAC]; Arm B: Canarypox HIV-specific&#xD;
      immunogen [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: ALVAC-HIV] (vCP1452); Arm C: 8-week cycles of IL-2 plus&#xD;
      vaccine placebo [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: ALVAC]; Arm D: 8-week cycles of IL-2 plus&#xD;
      canarypox HIV-specific immunogen [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: ALVAC-HIV] (vCP1452).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vaccine (or vaccine placebo) injections at Weeks 0, 8, 16, 24, and 48. IL-2&#xD;
      injections are synchronized with vaccine injections. IL-2 is given open-label while vCP1452&#xD;
      is double-blinded. Patients must be on Step I for a minimum of 51 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      08/23/01: prior to entry into Step II].&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP II: Patients stop study medications and interrupt potent antiretroviral therapy for [AS&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: &quot;6 to 16&quot; has been replaced by the following text: a minimum of 12]&#xD;
      weeks. Patients whose viral load during Step II remains [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: at or]&#xD;
      below 5,000 copies/ml [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: and whose CD4 count is 200 cells/mm3 or&#xD;
      more] are encouraged to remain off antiretroviral medications and continue viral-load&#xD;
      monitoring for up to an additional 10 weeks. These patients are followed [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      08/23/01: &quot;for up to 16 weeks&quot; has been replaced by the following text: through Week 74] on&#xD;
      Step II and must register to Step III only if their viral load increases to 50,000 copies/ml&#xD;
      or greater, their CD4 count decreases to below 200 cells/mm3, or if their primary care&#xD;
      physician recommends resuming antiretrovirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP III: Patients resume their original potent antiretroviral therapy regimen for 6 to 10&#xD;
      weeks and are monitored for a minimum of 6 weeks. If patients do not achieve a viral load&#xD;
      below 50 copies/ml during those 6 weeks, they continue to be monitored for up to an&#xD;
      additional 4 weeks until this degree of suppression is achieved with the same potent&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy regimen or another appropriate regimen.&#xD;
