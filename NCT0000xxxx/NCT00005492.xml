      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 25 years, a sustained and marked decline in death rates from coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) has occurred for all major segments of the U.S. population. Recently, however,&#xD;
      the decline has proceeded less rapidly in blacks than in whites, and in women than men. These&#xD;
      trends have focused further attention on possible heterogeneity in the risk factor patterns&#xD;
      among the demographic sub-groups. Previous studies of CHD risk factors in blacks and whites&#xD;
      using the First National Health and Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study&#xD;
      (NHEFS-I, 11-year follow-up), including this group's own work, demonstrate its potential&#xD;
      strengths, while at the same time foundering on the problem of low statistical power. With&#xD;
      the extension of the follow-up of NHANES-I cohort (1971-1974) to 1987 (14 years) and the&#xD;
      completion of 14-year follow-up for NHANES II cohort (1976-1980), a strong rationale exists&#xD;
      to undertake a &quot;pooling project.&quot; The resulting data set would provide optimal&#xD;
      characterization of CHD risk at the national level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sought to determine whether data from NHANES I and NHANES II could be pooled. To&#xD;
      accomplish this, the distribution of baseline measures was assessed and a determination was&#xD;
      made whether the same logistic prediction equations fitted both studies. Also, gender-race&#xD;
      differences were examined in individual exposure-outcome relationships, patterns of&#xD;
      co-morbidity, and population attributable risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
