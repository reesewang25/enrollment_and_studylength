  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the relationship between the oral dose of zidovudine (AZT) and its hematologic&#xD;
      toxicity. AZT has preliminarily been shown to decrease significant events and death in a&#xD;
      group of AIDS / Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and AIDS related complex (ARC) patients&#xD;
      followed at this time for a limited period. If these data withstand further follow-up, it&#xD;
      appears that AZT is a potential antiretroviral agent that may have application in the use of&#xD;
      all stages of HIV disease. At this time the optimal dose that will not cause significant&#xD;
      toxicity is not known. If this drug has widespread application, it becomes imperative to&#xD;
      further study both the dose and the toxicity. Patients with documented HIV viremia and who&#xD;
      are well will be evaluated in a dose-escalating protocol for toxicity, persistent viremia,&#xD;
      evidence of improvement of immune dysfunction, and the development of further manifestation&#xD;
      of HIV disease. Drug levels will be monitored and correlated with the toxicity and viremia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have HIV reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must belong to one of the following three groups according to the CDC&#xD;
             classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IIB - including only those patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia (platelet count =&#xD;
             or &lt; 100000 platelets/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OR Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count = or &lt; 1000 cells/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OR Helper cell lymphopenia (helper cells &lt; the mean of normals).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OR CDC classification III or IV-C2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with = or &lt; involuntary 10 percent weight loss in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weigh 70 kg + or - 15 kg in order to standardize the g/kg dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive antibody for HIV by an ELISA test kit. If the ELISA is negative, then&#xD;
             eligibility will be confirmed by second confirmatory test, i.e., immunoblot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AIDS or the CDC classification stage IV except stage IV-C2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV antibody negative by immunoblot.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent fevers of &gt; 38.5 degrees C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent diarrhea undiagnosed &gt; 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involuntary weight loss of &gt; 10 percent in the 6 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 2, 3, or 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
