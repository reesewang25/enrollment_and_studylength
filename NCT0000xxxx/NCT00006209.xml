  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give tucaresol to HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      who are taking combination anti-HIV therapy (HAART). This study also examines the effect&#xD;
      tucaresol has on viral load (level of HIV in the body) when tucaresol is used with HAART.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients are enrolled sequentially into the next available dosage cohort. Each cohort&#xD;
      receives a single dose of tucaresol, is observed for 2 weeks, and then receives 3&#xD;
      alternate-day doses of drug and careful safety monitoring, including 4 weeks follow-up after&#xD;
      the final dose. Dose cohorts receive drug sequentially, the lowest-dose cohort receiving the&#xD;
      drug first. Dose escalation may not proceed to the next higher-dose cohort until all patients&#xD;
      from the prior lower-dose cohort have completed the 4-week follow-up after the multiple&#xD;
      dosing, adverse events are within the described bounds, and the FDA has reviewed the safety&#xD;
      information from the treated cohort and approved the dose escalation. The drug is&#xD;
      administered 4 times within the 8 weeks of the study period. Weekly visits are required.&#xD;
      Patients receive financial compensation.&#xD;
