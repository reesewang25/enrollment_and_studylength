      To evaluate the effectiveness of both argon laser photocoagulation and aspirin therapy in&#xD;
      delaying or preventing progression of early diabetic retinopathy to more severe stages of&#xD;
      visual loss and blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help determine the best time to initiate photocoagulation treatment in diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To monitor closely the effects of diabetes mellitus and of photocoagulation on visual&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To produce natural history data that can be used to identify risk factors and test etiologic&#xD;
      hypotheses in diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ETDRS was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate argon laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation and aspirin treatment in the management of patients with nonproliferative or&#xD;
      early proliferative diabetic retinopathy. A total of 3,711 patients were recruited to be&#xD;
      followed for a minimum of 4 years to provide long-term information on the risks and benefits&#xD;
      of the treatments under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria for the ETDRS were designed to include a broad range of macular&#xD;
      edema severity, from a few small hard exudates within a disc diameter of the fovea with&#xD;
      normal visual acuity to extensive cystoid spaces with a visual acuity of 20/200. All study&#xD;
      patients had one eye randomly assigned to immediate photocoagulation and the other eye to&#xD;
      deferral of photocoagulation until high-risk proliferative retinopathy developed. During&#xD;
      followup, additional photocoagulation was allowed for any degree of macular edema within the&#xD;
      eligibility range, but additional photocoagulation was required only for edema involving or&#xD;
      threatening the center of the macula. The term &quot;clinically significant macular edema&quot; was&#xD;
      coined to designate this level of severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial use of aspirin therapy was based on clinical observation and on aspirin's possible&#xD;
      mechanisms of action. Previous observations of diabetic patients who were taking large doses&#xD;
      of aspirin for rheumatoid arthritis showed that the prevalence of retinopathy in this group&#xD;
      was lower than the prevalence that would be expected in the diabetic population at large.&#xD;
      Evidence suggested that diabetic patients have altered platelet aggregation and&#xD;
      disaggregation, which may contribute to the capillary closure seen in retinopathy. This&#xD;
      abnormality is reversed by aspirin in vitro . However, because of aspirin's other possible&#xD;
      mechanisms of action and its well-known side effects, such as allergic, idiosyncratic, and&#xD;
      intolerance reactions, the use of this therapy in the ETDRS was carefully controlled and&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
