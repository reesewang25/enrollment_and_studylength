  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give 1592U89 to children (aged 6 months&#xD;
      until 14th birthday) with advanced HIV infection who have few treatment options available.&#xD;
      The study also examines the effect 1592U89 has on the levels of HIV in the blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study. All patients will be treated with 1592U89.&#xD;
      Additionally, since optimal therapy usually includes the combined use of 2 or more&#xD;
      antiretroviral agents in advanced patients, other novel antiretroviral therapies may be&#xD;
      accessed through commercial means or via compassionate use programs. NOTE: 1592U89 should not&#xD;
      be administered as a single new agent added to a failing treatment regimen.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;

        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intravenous immunoglobulin G.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage&#xD;
             colony stimulating factor, for the management of hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High risk for disease progression or mortality as defined by either of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Viral load &gt; 100,000 copies/ml and CD4 cells &lt; 15% of total lymphocyte count despite&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks of therapy with commercially available antiretrovirals or as a result&#xD;
             of no therapy due to treatment-limiting toxicity of ZDV, 3TC, and ddI; or&#xD;
             HIV-associated encephalopathy refractory to ZDV-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No access to any 1592U89 pediatric study where the patient could qualify for&#xD;
             inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent or legal guardian with the ability to understand and provide written consent&#xD;
             for the patient to participate in the trial. Study patients over 13 years should also&#xD;
             give written informed consent whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;

             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal failure requiring dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic failure evident by Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia and AST &gt; 10 X upper limits&#xD;
             of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life-threatening infection or other chronic disease that may interfere with taking&#xD;
             1592U89 or compromise the patient's safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Documented hypersensitivity to 1592U89 or any other nucleoside analogue.&#xD;
