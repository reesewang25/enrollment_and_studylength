      RATIONALE: Antiemetic drugs such as granisetron may help to prevent nausea and vomiting in&#xD;
      patients treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of granisetron with that of&#xD;
      a placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy in patients who have malignant&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy and safety of oral granisetron versus placebo in&#xD;
      preventing nausea and vomiting during the 48 hours that begins 24 hours after administration&#xD;
      of cyclophosphamide-based or carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens in patients with&#xD;
      malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel, multicenter study.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral&#xD;
      granisetron on day 0 at 60 minutes prior to the scheduled administration of IV&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide or carboplatin (or doxorubicin) chemotherapy. On days 1 and 2, patients&#xD;
      receive oral granisetron at approximately the same time as on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive&#xD;
      oral granisetron on day 0 as in arm I. On days 1 and 2, patients receive oral placebo at&#xD;
      approximately the same time as the granisetron tablets were taken on day 0. Patients are&#xD;
      followed between 5 and 11 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 434 patients (217 per arm) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of malignant disease eligible for chemotherapy Scheduled&#xD;
        to receive a regimen of chemotherapy containing IV cyclophosphamide or carboplatin, with or&#xD;
        without other chemotherapy agents Cyclophosphamide must be given at a dose of 500-1,200&#xD;
        mg/m2 Carboplatin must be given at a dose of at least 300 mg/m2 unless Calvert dosing&#xD;
        equation (using target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min) requires less than 300 mg/m2 Doxorubicin, if&#xD;
        given, must be infused within a period not exceeding 1 hour Minimum doses are to be based&#xD;
        on actual body weight Other emetogenic or nonemetogenic agents are permitted to be included&#xD;
        in the day 0 chemotherapy regimen without restriction on dose Emetogenic agents must be&#xD;
        given as part of cyclophosphamide-based or carboplatin-based regimen on day 0 and not at&#xD;
        another time within the 72 hour period Cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, or doxorubicin must&#xD;
        be the first emetogenic agent given No cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and&#xD;
        prednisone (CHOP) regimen No primary or secondary (from metastatic disease) brain neoplasm&#xD;
