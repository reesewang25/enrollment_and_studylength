      To re-examine the relationship between suppressed anger, elevated blood pressure and&#xD;
      all-cause as well as coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality using data from the Life Change&#xD;
      Event Study (LCES) conducted on a representative sample of the Tecumseh Community Health&#xD;
      Study (TCHS), n=696, men and women, aged 30-69 in 1971-1972.&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychosocial data (e.g. anger-expression, stressful life events) and some medical data&#xD;
      (e.g. blood pressure, smoking) were collected in 1971/72, while additional information about&#xD;
      other medical risk factors was collected in 1968/69. Mortality ascertainment and cause of&#xD;
      death was completed by the end of 1989, through TCHS staff, using the National Death Index&#xD;
      (NDI). The estimated cumulative 18-year mortality rate as of 1989 for the Tecumseh cohort of&#xD;
      the same age as the LCES sample was 26 percent for males and 16 percent for females.&#xD;
      Approximately 144 deaths were expected. Out of the total TCHS cohort deaths, 35 percent were&#xD;
      estimated to be due to CHD. Research questions tested included: (1) did suppressed anger&#xD;
      predict coronary heart disease mortality as well as all-cause mortality; (2) was the&#xD;
      relationship between suppressed anger and mortality modified by other risk factors (e.g.&#xD;
      blood pressure, marital stress, gender); (3) were there certain anger-coping strategies among&#xD;
      married couples which increased mortality risk for one or both members of the marital pair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses were done at three levels: for the whole sample, separately for males and females,&#xD;
      and for a subgroup of 192 married couples it was done by 'pairs'. To determine univariate&#xD;
      association between anger-coping types and all-cause mortality, the percent deceased was&#xD;
      compared among persons grouped according to their anger responses. For the situation-specific&#xD;
      and total suppressed anger indices, the distribution of scores was divided into thirds. The&#xD;
      significance of each association was tested using chi-square statistics. Logistic regression&#xD;
      was employed to test for the significance of the association between anger-coping measures&#xD;
      and mortality controlling for sex, age, education, marital stress, relative weight, smoking,&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure, CHD status, bronchitis, and FEV1 scores. Logistic regression was&#xD;
      also used to determine whether any of the risk factors, particularly blood pressure, gender&#xD;
      and marital stress, significantly modified the relationship between suppressed anger and&#xD;
      mortality. The design and measures of this study had the potential to further identify&#xD;
      specific person-situation characteristics associated with higher risks of total as well as&#xD;
      cause specific mortality which then could be used to make more knowledgeable recommendations&#xD;
      for health behavior interventions.&#xD;
