      To evaluate the safety of administering Therion Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV-1 IIIB env/gag/pol&#xD;
      Vaccine (TBC-3B) vaccinations to vaccinia-naive individuals. To evaluate the immunogenicity&#xD;
      of priming with TBC-3B by the scarification, intradermal, and subcutaneous routes, followed&#xD;
      by booster immunization of MN rgp120 HIV-1. To compare the immunogenicity of priming with&#xD;
      TBC-3B in vaccinia-naive individuals to vaccinia-immune individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prior trials evaluating alternative methods of vaccine administration, scarification has&#xD;
      been found to be an imprecise method of administration and allows only 1.0 - 2.5 microliters&#xD;
      of immunogen to be given. Since it is not feasible to produce vaccine at concentrations&#xD;
      higher than 10 to the 10th pfu/ml, this method limits the maximum deliverable dose.&#xD;
      Intradermal and subcutaneous injection routes allow larger volumes of vaccinia to be given,&#xD;
      i.e.: up to 200 microliters intradermally and up to 100 ml subcutaneously. In the present&#xD;
      study, the initial priming dose will be the same administered by all 3 methods; however, the&#xD;
      second priming dose administered at 2 months intradermally and subcutaneously will be 2 logs&#xD;
      higher in order to achieve boosting of immune responses, particularly to gag and pol&#xD;
      components of TBC-3B.&#xD;

      components of TBC-3B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After volunteers are recruited, screened and enrolled in the study, they will be randomized&#xD;
      to group C, D, or E. Each group will enroll 10 patients and 2 controls. The placebo control&#xD;
      for TBC-3B will be standard vaccinia vaccination administered at doses no higher than that&#xD;
      administered by scarification; the placebo control for MN rgp120 will be alum. Group C will&#xD;
      receive undiluted TBC-3B by scarification, at months 0 and 2. Group D will receive diluted&#xD;
      TBC-3B intradermally at month 0 and undiluted TBC-3B at month 2. Group E will receive diluted&#xD;
      TBC-3B subcutaneously at month 0 and undiluted TBC-3B at month 2. At months 8 and 12 all&#xD;
      groups will receive MN rgp 120/HIV-1 in alum intramuscularly.&#xD;
