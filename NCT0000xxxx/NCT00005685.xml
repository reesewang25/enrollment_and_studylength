      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental and psychosocial factors relating to hypertension and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      are incompletely understood, particularly for women and African Americans. Recent research&#xD;
      has suggested that job strain is more strongly linked to elevated work blood pressure in men&#xD;
      than women. In contrast, the combination of having a high status job plus the trait of high&#xD;
      effort coping style (John Henryism) was related to higher work blood pressure in women and&#xD;
      African American men, but not Caucasian men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grant has been ongoing since September 1983. The original study had as its purpose to&#xD;
      ascertain similarities and differences in the etiology of hypertension for Blacks and whites&#xD;
      and to identify those biobehavioral factors contributing to the excess risk for hypertension&#xD;
      among Blacks. Myocardial, blood pressure, and renal responses (sodium and potassium handling)&#xD;
      to laboratory and naturalistic stressors were evaluated in young adult normotensive or&#xD;
      marginally hypertensive Black and white men. Behavioral stressors included competitive,&#xD;
      reaction time tasks (active coping) as well as more passive coping conditions. Data were&#xD;
      collected on family history of hypertension, family social class background, Type A behavior,&#xD;
      propensity for anger and hostility, and coping style. The role of the sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system in mediating these effects was assessed by the use of beta-adrenergic antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the grant was renewed in 1991, the goal of the research was to evaluate the interactive&#xD;
      effects of environmental stressors and sodium chloride (NACl) and potassium (K) intake as&#xD;
      they related to hypertension development in a biracial population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were two studies in the current grant. Study 1 reexamined hypothesized relationships of&#xD;
      high effort coping and job strain to elevated ambulatory blood pressure (BP) at work and at&#xD;
      home in a sample of 288 Black and white men and women stratified by job status. Also,&#xD;
      assessments were made of the relationships of these traits to increased epinephrine and&#xD;
      norepinephrine responses, other measures of sympathetic activation, adverse lipid profiles,&#xD;
      and cardiac and vascular structural changes. Job strain and high effort coping were also&#xD;
      related to hypertension prevalence in 576 black and white men and women stratified by job&#xD;
      status. The influence of additional psychosocial variables (social support, hostility,&#xD;
      anger-in, depressed mood, anxiety) was also examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 built on prior research on gender differences in total peripheral resistance during&#xD;
      stressors which enhance alpha-adrenergic activity, and on a recent observation that among&#xD;
      young adults, slow sodium excretion during stress is seen in five times as many men as women.&#xD;
      It also built on recent work suggesting that estrogen may attenuate total peripheral&#xD;
      resistance responses to stress by reducing vasoconstrictive effects of alpha-adrenergic&#xD;
      activity. The study was designed to examine cardiovascular, lipid, epinephrine,&#xD;
      norepinephrine, and sodium excretion responses to stressors in 120 subjects maintained for a&#xD;
      week on a controlled high salt diet. Thirty subjects were tested in each of these groups: 1)&#xD;
      premenopausal women, 2) postmenopausal women not using hormone replacement therapy, 3)&#xD;
      postmenopausal women using hormone replacement, 4) men. Each group included 15 Black and 15&#xD;
      white subjects, and each subject was tested twice, once after receiving placebo and once&#xD;
      after receiving either an alpha- or a beta-receptor antagonist.&#xD;
