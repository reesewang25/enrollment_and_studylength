      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first component of the study investigated associations among discrimination, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and cardiovascular risk factors, and used data from Exam IV (1992-1993) of CARDIA,&#xD;
      a multi-site longitudinal study of cardiovascular risk factors among Black and white men and&#xD;
      women. Analyses examined the association between blood pressure and discrimination based on&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, and religion, and took into account&#xD;
      response to unfair treatment. To assess for effect modification, separate analyses were&#xD;
      performed for the eight strata defined by the sampling strategy: Black/white x male/female x&#xD;
      equal to or less than high school/more than high school. Additional multivariate analyses&#xD;
      examined whether, within the four gender/education strata, discrimination contributed to&#xD;
      Black/white differences in blood pressure, adjusting for relevant covariates. Other analyses&#xD;
      explored the relationship between discrimination, response to unfair treatment, and other&#xD;
      possible cardiovascular risk factors, including hostility, body fat distribution, lipid&#xD;
      fractions, blood glucose, skin color, substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs),&#xD;
      and body self-image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second component concerned appropriate measures of social class for studies of women's&#xD;
      health. It used data on 718 women who participated in Examination II of the Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Women Twins Study (1989-1990) . Socioeconomic information existed on: adult individual and&#xD;
      household class (which took into account the individual class position of both the respondent&#xD;
      and her partner or head-of-household, if present), childhood household class, and class&#xD;
      trajectory (comparing childhood and adult household class). Data on health characteristics&#xD;
      included: blood pressure, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, lipoprotein fractions, fasting&#xD;
      and postload insulin and glucose serum concentrations, self-assessed health status, age at&#xD;
      first completed pregnancy, total number of childbirths, duration of breast feeding, physical&#xD;
      activity, and smoking status. Analyses evaluated whether different magnitudes of class-based&#xD;
      differences in these health characteristics were detected with these diverse measures of&#xD;
      social class, using multivariate techniques that corrected for the correlation of errors&#xD;
      within twin pairs. The effects of using these different class measures were also examined for&#xD;
      analyses testing the hypothesis that social class was inversely related to risk of&#xD;
      hypertension among women, adjusting for relevant covariates.&#xD;
