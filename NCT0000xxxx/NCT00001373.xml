  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the genetics and pathophysiology of diseases presenting&#xD;
      with intermittent fever, including familial Mediterranean fever, TRAPS, hyper-IgD syndrome,&#xD;
      and related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following individuals may be eligible for this study: 1) patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      familial Mediterranean fever, TRAPS, hyper-IgD syndrome or related disorders; 2) relatives of&#xD;
      these patients; 3) healthy, normal volunteers 7 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a medical and family history, physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. Additional tests and procedures may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. X-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consultations with specialists&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. DNA sample collection (blood or saliva sample) for genetic studies. These might include&#xD;
           studies of specific genes, or more complete sequencing of the genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Additional blood samples a maximum of 1 pint (450 ml) during a 6-week period for studies&#xD;
           of white cell adhesion (stickiness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Leukapheresis for collecting larger amounts of white cells for study. For this&#xD;
           procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood flows&#xD;
           through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are removed and&#xD;
           the rest of the blood is returned to the body through another needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be followed approximately every 6 months to monitor symptoms, adjust medicine&#xD;
      dosages, and undergo routine blood and urine tests. They will receive genetic counseling by&#xD;
      the study team on the risk of having affected children and be advised of treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating relatives will undergo a medical and family history, possibly with a review of&#xD;
      medical records, physical examination, blood and urine tests. Additional procedures may&#xD;
      include a 24-hour urine collection, X-rays, and consultations with medical specialists. A DNA&#xD;
      sample (blood or saliva) will also be collected for genetic studies. Additional blood samples&#xD;
      of no more than 550 mL during an 8-week period may be requested for studies of white cell&#xD;
      adhesion (stickiness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatives who have familial Mediterranean fever, TRAPS, or hyper-IgD syndrome will receive&#xD;
      the same follow-up and counseling as described for patients above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and patients with gout will have a brief health interview and check of&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) and will provide a blood sample (up to 90 ml, or 6&#xD;
      tablespoons). Additional blood samples of no more than 1 pint over a 6-week period may be&#xD;
      requested in the future....&#xD;

      This is an exploratory natural history protocol that enrolls patients with known or as yet&#xD;
      undiagnosed disorders of inflammation. Blood, saliva, or buccal samples will be collected for&#xD;
      genetic analysis, blood samples will be obtained for immunologic and other functional&#xD;
      studies, a small number of subjects may undergo skin biopsy, leukapheresis, or bone marrow&#xD;
      aspiration and biopsy, and some subjects will be provided standard medical care follow up,&#xD;
      with retrospective analysis of the clinical data gathered during follow up. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to discover the genetic basis of human disorders of inflammation. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to enumerate immunologic features and genotype-phenotype associations in&#xD;
      specific autoinflammatory diseases. The tertiary objective is to describe the clinical&#xD;
      features of poorly characterized or newly defined disorders of inflammation. This protocol&#xD;
      provided clinical support for the identification of the gene mutated in familial&#xD;
      Mediterranean fever (FMF), the discovery of the TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome&#xD;
      (TRAPS), the identification of NLRP3 mutations in the neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory&#xD;
      disease (NOMID), the discovery of the deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), and&#xD;
      the proposal of the now widely accepted concept of autoinflammatory disease. During the last&#xD;
      decade the protocol has provided the clinical foundation for the discovery of ten more&#xD;
      monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, seven of which were previously unrecognized as distinct&#xD;
      diseases. The protocol has also permitted numerous studies delineating the mechanisms of&#xD;
      autoinflammation and its connections with the human innate immune system. The work catalyzed&#xD;
      by this protocol has provided the conceptual basis for a number of targeted therapies. During&#xD;
      the next decade the objective will be to utilize cutting edge genomic technologies to further&#xD;
      advance discovery.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are three populations that will be included in this study: subjects with known or&#xD;
        suspected autoinflammatory diseases, family members of subjects with known or suspected&#xD;
        autoinflammatory diseases, and healthy controls. In order to be eligible to participate in&#xD;
        this study as a subject with known or suspected autoinflammatory disease, an individual&#xD;
        must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stated willingness to participate in study procedures (which at the very least&#xD;
             includes providing a mail-in sample for genetic analysis);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Regardless of gender, at least one month of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A medical history that, in the expert opinion of the study team, is consistent with&#xD;
             the possibility of autoinflammatory disease; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability of the subject, parents (in the case of children), or Legally Authorized&#xD;
             Representative to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study as a family member of a subject with&#xD;
        known or suspected autoinflammatory disease, an individual must meet all of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stated willingness to participate in study procedures (which at the very least&#xD;
             includes providing a mail-in sample for genetic analysis);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Regardless of gender, at least one month of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Relationship, either by blood or marriage, to an individual enrolled or about to be&#xD;
             enrolled in the study with known or suspected autoinflammatory disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Likelihood, in the expert opinion of the study team, that analysis of a sample from&#xD;
             the individual would advance genetic or functional analysis of the affected relative s&#xD;
             possible autoinflammatory condition; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability of the subject, parents (in the case of children), or Legally Authorized&#xD;
             Representative to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study as a healthy volunteer, an individual&#xD;
        must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stated willingness to participate in study procedures for healthy volunteers;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Regardless of gender, at least one year old, and not pregnant (by history of a missed&#xD;
             menstrual period);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Likelihood, in the expert opinion of the study team, that a sample from the individual&#xD;
             would advance the functional analysis of an autoinflammatory condition under study;&#xD;
             and&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability of the subject or parents (in the case of children) to understand and the&#xD;
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For any of the three categories of subjects, an individual will be excluded from&#xD;
        participation in this study if he or she has a medical condition that would, in the opinion&#xD;
        of the investigators, confuse the interpretation of the study.&#xD;
