  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating carpal tunnel syndrome&#xD;
      (CTS). People who participate in this study will have CTS that has been diagnosed by physical&#xD;
      examination and neurological testing. We will randomly assign study participants to receive&#xD;
      one of the three types of acupuncture either once, twice, or three times weekly for a total&#xD;
      of 6 weeks. Acupuncturists will treat one group of patients with true acupuncture. They will&#xD;
      give the other two groups of patients one of two alternative acupuncture treatments that do&#xD;
      not use the true acupuncture points. The patients and evaluators will not know the type of&#xD;
      acupuncture (True, Alternative 1, or Alternative 2) that is being used. The acupuncturists&#xD;
      will not communicate with the patients and will not be involved in patient evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of acupuncture for carpal tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome (CTS). The study's aims are: (1) To show that we can develop a &quot;single-blind mute&quot;&#xD;
      methodology that will enable true and alternative acupuncture to be given in a standardized&#xD;
      and unbiased fashion. (2) To identify and standardize the most appropriate invasive control&#xD;
      (alternative) acupuncture points for CTS. (3) To develop a manual of acupuncture methods that&#xD;
      codifies the techniques of administration of true and alternative points that can be used at&#xD;
      any site performing a randomized clinical trial for CTS. (4) To demonstrate that patient&#xD;
      recruitment for and retention in a small, short-term, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of&#xD;
      acupuncture for CTS is sufficient to justify a full-scale RCT. (5) To determine, in an RCT,&#xD;
      whether true acupuncture provides meaningful benefit for pain in CTS compared to alternative&#xD;
      acupuncture and whether the frequency of administration of acupuncture influences the&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients and evaluators will be blinded as to the type of acupuncture (True, Alternative&#xD;
      1, or Alternative 2). The acupuncturists will not be blinded but will be mute&#xD;
      (noncommunicative to the patients) and will not be involved in patient evaluation. Patients&#xD;
      will have clinically and electrodiagnostically proven CTS. They will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      one of the three types of acupuncture either once, twice, or three times weekly for 6 weeks&#xD;
      total (three by three design). Our aim is to recruit 144 patients for this study. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be a validated CTS Symptom Severity Scale at 2 weeks after the last&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment. We will evaluate patients 10 weeks later to determine the durability&#xD;
      of any improvement from acupuncture. Other outcome measures include subjective symptoms,&#xD;
      functional status, analgesic consumption, frequency/duration of splinting, and effect on&#xD;
      median nerve conduction velocity.&#xD;
