  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A subgroup of patients with childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tic&#xD;
      disorders has been identified who share a common clinical course characterized by dramatic&#xD;
      onset and symptom exacerbations following group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS)&#xD;
      infections. This subgroup is designated by the acronym PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). There are five clinical&#xD;
      characteristics that define the PANDAS subgroup: presence of OCD and/or tic disorder;&#xD;
      prepubertal symptom onset; sudden onset or abrupt exacerbations (relapsing-remitting course);&#xD;
      association with neurological abnormalities (presence of adventitious movements or motoric&#xD;
      hyperactivity during exacerbations); and temporal association between symptom exacerbations&#xD;
      and GABHS infections. In this subgroup, periodic exacerbations appear to be triggered by&#xD;
      GABHS infections in a manner similar to that of Sydenham's chorea, the neurological variant&#xD;
      of rheumatic fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatic fever is a disorder with a presumed post-streptococcal autoimmune etiology. The&#xD;
      streptococcal pathogenesis of rheumatic fever is supported by studies that have demonstrated&#xD;
      the effectiveness of penicillin prophylaxis in preventing recurrences of this illness. A&#xD;
      trial of penicillin prophylaxis in the PANDAS subgroup demonstrated that penicillin was not&#xD;
      superior to placebo as prophylaxis against GABHS infections in these children, but this&#xD;
      outcome was felt to be secondary to non-compliance with treatment, and there was no decrease&#xD;
      in the number of neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations in this group. In a study comparing&#xD;
      azithromycin and penicillin, both drugs were completely effective in preventing streptococcal&#xD;
      infections - there were no documented titer elevations during the year-long study period for&#xD;
      children taking either penicillin or azithromycin. Comparable reductions in the severity of&#xD;
      tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were also observed. Thus, penicillin was not&#xD;
      performing as an &quot;active placebo&quot; as originally postulated, but rather provided effective&#xD;
      prophylaxis against Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal. Both azithromycin and penicillin&#xD;
      appear to be effective in eliminating GABHS infections, and reducing neuropsychiatric symptom&#xD;
      severity; thus, between-group differences are negligible. Since increasing the &quot;n&quot; to&#xD;
      demonstrate superiority of one prophylactic agent over another would be impractical, we have&#xD;
      amended the study design to address two issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if antibiotics prophylaxis against GABHS infections is superior to placebo&#xD;
           in prolonging periods of remission among children in the PANDAS subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if antibiotics prophylaxis against GABHS infections is superior to placebo&#xD;
           in improving overall symptom severity for obsessive-compulsive symptoms and tics among&#xD;
           children in the PANDAS subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because penicillin has a narrower therapeutic index and is less expensive than azithromycin,&#xD;
      it is the preferable prophylactic agent. Further, penicillin (250 mg orally twice a day) has&#xD;
      a long history of providing safe and effective prophylaxis for rheumatic fever and is the&#xD;
      first line oral therapy recommended by the American Heart Association. Thus, penicillin has&#xD;
      been chosen as the prophylactic antibiotic in the present study. Blister packs are used to&#xD;
      increase compliance and to allow for easier documentation of missed doses.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether penicillin prevents the symptoms of&#xD;
      Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD) and tic disorders from recurring in children with&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of children with childhood-onset OCD and/or tic disorders share a common clinical&#xD;
      course characterized by dramatic onset and symptom exacerbations following scarlet fever or&#xD;
      strep. throat infections. Such infections may be prevented by the prophylactic (preventative&#xD;
      dose) administration of antibiotics, such as penicillin. This study will determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of penicillin prophylaxis in preventing relapses of OCD and/or tics in the&#xD;
      PANDAS subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive a comprehensive psychiatric, neurological and physical evaluation.&#xD;
      Children will initially receive penicillin tablets, and then will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either penicillin or placebo tablets for 6 months. Children will be monitored monthly&#xD;
      by either in-person visits or a telephone interview. Any child who has a significant increase&#xD;
      in his or her OCD or tics is taken off the randomized medication and put on open-label&#xD;
      penicillin for the rest of the study.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ages 4 - 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Fulfill criteria for membership in the PANDAS subgroup:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Presence of OCD and/or tic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Prepubertal symptom onset&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Abrupt onset and episodic (relapsing-remitting) symptom course&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Association between symptom exacerbations and GABHS infections&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Presence of choreiform movements or other neurological abnormalities during&#xD;
                  symptom exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because &quot;time to relapse&quot; is one of the primary outcome variables, children will not be&#xD;
        eligible for randomization until their symptoms are in (at least partial) remission. At the&#xD;
        time of randomization, symptom severity scores should be less than 50% of the child's&#xD;
        previous maximum score on both the CY-BOCS and YGTSS, and no higher than a total score of&#xD;
        20 on the CY-BOCS or 30 on the YGTSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Personal history of penicillin allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of rheumatic fever, including Sydenham's chorea&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of autism, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Chronic illnesses, particularly neurologic and immunologic disorders&#xD;
