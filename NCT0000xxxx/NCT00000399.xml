  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We started the Bone, Estrogen, Strength Training (BEST) study in the fall of 1995 at the&#xD;
      University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona. The BEST study is the largest of its kind. It looks&#xD;
      at the effects of hormone replacement therapy and strength training exercise on bone mineral&#xD;
      density. (Bone mineral density affects bone strength and the risk of osteoporosis.) Six&#xD;
      groups of about 300 women each participated in this osteoporosis prevention study. In 1998,&#xD;
      the BEST study received additional funding to examine for another 2 years the long-term&#xD;
      effects of strength training on bone mineral density. By 2001 we will have finished analyzing&#xD;
      the results for all study groups on the 1-year effects of exercise on bone, as well as&#xD;
      additional analyses on the effects of 2, 3, and 4 years of strength training and&#xD;
      weight-bearing exercise on bone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoporotic fractures associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) are a significant&#xD;
      public health problem for women, resulting in over 1 million fractures per year. The&#xD;
      increasing incidence of fractures will make an already major health problem an even greater&#xD;
      one in the future. Estimates of medical costs for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures are&#xD;
      expected to increase from $14.8 billion in 1995 to $60 billion by 2020. Although the Women's&#xD;
      Health Initiative is investigating dietary and hormonal factors in relation to bone density,&#xD;
      it is not investigating the effects of exercise on reducing bone mineral loss in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes completion of a large, partially randomized clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      effect of a 1-year exercise intervention on total body and regional BMD in two populations&#xD;
      (hormone replacement therapy [HRT] versus no HRT) of postmenopausal women with a previous&#xD;
      history of physical inactivity. A major hypothesis is that, compared to the no-exercise&#xD;
      group, the exercise intervention will be an effective alternative to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      osteoporosis and the exercise effects will be larger in the cohort of women on HRT than those&#xD;
      not on HRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise program includes progressive resistance exercises using free weights and weight&#xD;
      resistance machines and weight-bearing aerobic exercises. We carefully supervise and monitor&#xD;
      the exercise compliance by keeping records of the amount of exercise completed at each of&#xD;
      three weekly exercise sessions and by measuring strength gains of selected muscle groups. We&#xD;
      will measure biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption and hormonal correlates of&#xD;
      bone mineral density changes including sex steroids at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have obtained duplicate blood collections, made one week apart, for all cohorts at each of&#xD;
      the three measurement periods. We have also collected duplicate dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) scans at each time period to follow changes in axial and appendicular&#xD;
      BMD and total and regional soft tissue body composition as a result of the intervention. We&#xD;
      collected extensive dietary intake records during the first year of intervention; we will&#xD;
      monitor dietary intake in a 2-year followup using food frequency questionnaires. We will also&#xD;
      measure followup BMD, soft tissue, and lean and fat body composition for 2 years in all women&#xD;
      who complete the first-year intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hundred sixty-six women have completed the first year of the intervention. The study has&#xD;
      a retention rate of 92 percent in the first year for the first four cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the paucity of information regarding long-term effects of exercise, and because of&#xD;
      the increased emphasis in the scientific community on evaluating the long-term efficacy of&#xD;
      exercise interventions for osteoporosis prevention, this comprehensive 1-year clinical trial&#xD;
      and 2-year followup will make an important contribution to determining the future role of&#xD;
      combining progressive resistance and weight bearing aerobic exercise in the prevention of&#xD;
      osteoporosis in two populations (HRT vs. no HRT) of postmenopausal women.&#xD;
