      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1986, despite programs to have persons with known risk factors for exposure to the AIDS&#xD;
      virus exclude themselves from the blood donating population and the universal testing of all&#xD;
      donated whole blood and blood components for the antibody to HIV, the public was fearful of&#xD;
      acquiring AIDS via transfusion and media stories increased that fear. A major concern among&#xD;
      members of the blood banking community was the extent to which donors infected with HIV were&#xD;
      not identified by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) systems. Most experts believed that&#xD;
      self-deferral and the assays for the HIV antibody were eliminating the vast majority of&#xD;
      positive units of donated blood and blood components. If all units containing HIV were being&#xD;
      eliminated by the combined effects of self-deferral and antibody screening (and treatment of&#xD;
      factor VIII concentrates), no recipients of only screened whole blood or blood components or&#xD;
      factor VIII would become HIV virus and antibody positive as the result of transfusion.&#xD;
      Alternately, if some HIV positive units of whole blood or blood components or factor VIII&#xD;
      concentrates were not being eliminated by self-deferral and antibody screening (and treatment&#xD;
      of factor VIII concentrates), and these units were transfused, then some transfusion&#xD;
      recipients would become HIV antibody positive and viremic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiative was part of a special Fiscal Year 1986 National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Institute AIDS Plan. The concept was reviewed and approved by the National Heart, Lung, and&#xD;
      Blood Advisory Council in February 1986. The Request for Proposals was released in May 1986.&#xD;
      Two contracts were awarded in September 1986.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of California at San Francisco: A risk assessment was made of HIV infection&#xD;
      through prospective testing for seroconversion in women recipients of anti-HIV negative blood&#xD;
      transfusions at the University of California San Francisco hospitals. Blood specimens were&#xD;
      collected from each of the recipients pre-transfusion, and at two, four, and six months&#xD;
      post-transfusion. Patients were selected based on female sex and exclusion of high risk&#xD;
      behavior or blood transfusion during the preceding six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins University: The rate of seroconversion was determined in a cohort of cardiac&#xD;
      surgery patients receiving multiple transfusions of blood products screened for HIV antibody.&#xD;
      The study was conducted at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Texas Heart Institute, and the&#xD;
      Methodist Hospital in Houston. A serum sample for each patient was collected before surgery&#xD;
      and a second sample was collected at least six months after surgery.&#xD;
