      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant seasonal variation of blood cholesterol levels has been shown in a number of&#xD;
      cross-sectional studies, with important implications for national screening and therapeutic&#xD;
      guidelines. However, the phenomenon has not been well studied: little is known about etiology&#xD;
      or about seasonal variation of lipid subfractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators assessed the magnitude and timing of the seasonal effect for total&#xD;
      cholesterol and the important lipoprotein subfractions (low-density lipoprotein, high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein, triglycerides, apolipoproteins AI and B, and lipoprotein (a)) in both sexes and&#xD;
      at different ages. They also identified and quantified the effects of the main factors&#xD;
      determining the variation and assessed the seasonal variation of other blood elements thought&#xD;
      to play a role in the development of coronary heart disease, including hemostatic factors and&#xD;
      antioxidants Finally, they explored the implications of the phenomenon for public health&#xD;
      policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and serial measures were repeated quarterly for one year. These included measures&#xD;
      of: serum lipids and lipoproteins; antioxidant vitamins; platelets and hemostatic factors;&#xD;
      demographic factors; weight, waist-hip ratio, height, body mass index (BMI) and blood&#xD;
      pressure; dietary intake; physical activity; light exposure; and psychologic factors.&#xD;
      Meteorologic data were also collected. Data were collected by written questionnaire and by&#xD;
      the use of computer-assisted evening telephone interviews (CATI), which were used for the&#xD;
      collection of dietary, physical activity and individual light-exposure and other lifestyle&#xD;
      data. Activity and light data were verified in a subset of 80 patients by the use of a&#xD;
      monitoring device. Analyses included methods to describe the seasonal variation in dietary,&#xD;
      physical activity, psychologic, and light exposure data and repeated measures in linear&#xD;
      regression models to determine the roles of specific dietary, physical activity, psychologic,&#xD;
      and light-exposure related covariates in explaining variability in blood lipids, antioxidant&#xD;
      vitamins, and hemostatic factors.&#xD;
