  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumors of the spine can be described as primary, meaning that the tumor originated from cells&#xD;
      normally found in the spine, or metastatic, cells from another area of the body that have&#xD;
      spread to the spine. Metastatic tumors are more common than primary tumors. Tumors of the&#xD;
      spine can press against the spinal cord and interfere with information traveling down from&#xD;
      the brain to the nerves of the spinal cord. As a result, patients with spinal tumors can&#xD;
      suffer from loss of movement and sensation within areas of the body below the tumor. In&#xD;
      addition, tumors of the spine are typically painful conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, the treatment of choice for spinal tumors is radiation therapy. However, many&#xD;
      tumors of the spine become resistant to radiation therapy. In addition, because the spinal&#xD;
      cord is often so close to the tumor it can be damaged by the radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute (100%) ethanol is commonly known as &quot;alcohol&quot;. It is the same kind of alcohol found&#xD;
      in alcoholic beverages. When pure alcohol is injected directly into a tumor it can destroy&#xD;
      cells and blood vessels. Because of this feature, researchers would like to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of alcohol in treating patients with spinal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe that intratumoral ethanol injection is a treatment worth studying more&#xD;
      closely because it is minimally invasive, has been proven to be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      other types of metastatic tumors, can be used repeatedly, and does not interfere with other&#xD;
      treatments such as surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to testing the effectiveness of intratumoral ethanol injection, this study will&#xD;
      attempt to determine the causes of pain associated with spinal tumors.&#xD;

      Although radiation therapy is currently the treatment of choice for most spinal metastases,&#xD;
      radioresistant and recurrent neoplasms remain therapeutic dilemmas. Because of the debility&#xD;
      and shortened life expectancy of patients with spinal metastases, treatment that minimizes&#xD;
      blood loss, convalescence, and immobility is critical. The effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      intratumoral injection of absolute ethanol in eradicating vertebral hemangiomas and hepatic&#xD;
      metastases suggests that intratumoral ethanol injection may also be effective in treating&#xD;
      vertebral metastases. Since most spinal metastases can now be diagnosed with MRI before they&#xD;
      produce spinal instability, it may be possible to treat them with direct ethanol infusion&#xD;
      while preserving spinal stability. Direct ethanol infusion may prove especially useful in&#xD;
      treating symptomatic patients who have received maximal tolerable radiation doses to the&#xD;
      spinal cord. Unlike radiation, which is limited by total radiation dosage, and intraarterial&#xD;
      alcohol, which precludes multiple treatments by occluding the feeding arteries, intratumoral&#xD;
      ethanol injection can be repeated as necessary to obliterate residual tumor. The potential&#xD;
      neurotoxic effects of ethanol can be avoided by using CT-guidance to position the needle, by&#xD;
      monitoring a test injection with contrast, and by injecting ethanol slowly and in small&#xD;
      volumes. Intratumoral injection of absolute ethanol warrants a clinical trial because it is&#xD;
      minimally invasive, has been effective in treating peripheral metastases, can be used&#xD;
      repeatedly, and does not preclude other types of treatments such as open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well as testing the therapeutic efficacy of intratumoral ethanol for spinal metastasis,&#xD;
      this protocol seeks to elucidate the pathophysiology of pain from spinal metastasis.&#xD;
      Correlation of changes in pain with changes in tumor size and tumor pressure pre- and&#xD;
      post-ethanol injection should indicate the relationship of pain to tumor size and pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 11 patients with vertebral hemangiomas has been treated with intratumoral ethanol&#xD;
      at the NIH. This protocol will accrue patients with vertebral hemangiomas who require&#xD;
      treatment with intratumoral ethanol and will continue the post-treatment evaluation of&#xD;
      patients previously treated with intratumoral ethanol at the NIH.&#xD;

        Patients must have a vertebral tumor documented by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vertebral height must be at least 50 percent of adjacent vertebrae.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be symptomatic from their spinal tumor. Treatment attempts to reduce the size&#xD;
        of, or eliminate, their tumors and to relieve their symptoms. The treatment of the&#xD;
        vertebral tumor must be indicated based on the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior surgical or radiation therapy for the vertebral tumor will not result in exclusion&#xD;
        from the study if there is radiographic evidence of tumor and there is evidence of&#xD;
        persistent local pain, epidural compression, or neurological deterioration related to the&#xD;
        vertebral tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must be able to comprehend the risks of the therapy and must be able to give&#xD;
        informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy will exclude participation due to the radiation exposure involved in this&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bleeding disorders will exclude a patient from the protocol unless the disorder can be&#xD;
        corrected prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have no contraindications to MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients undergoing ethanol injection in the x-ray department must be able to lay prone for&#xD;
        at least one hour with intravenous sedation and analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients whose tumors have not responded to radiation therapy will be candidates for&#xD;
        ethanol infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with tumors in areas that have received maximal radiation doses to the spinal cord&#xD;
        will be candidates for ethanol infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients whose poor general condition precludes open surgery will be candidates for ethanol&#xD;
        infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who wish to avoid the morbidity and potential mortality of open surgery will be&#xD;
        candidates for ethanol injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with radioresistant tumors such as melanoma or prostate carcinoma are candidates&#xD;
        for ethanol infusion even if they have not undergone prior irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with radiation-sensitive spinal tumors such as breast, kidney, and lung carcinoma,&#xD;
        lymphoma, myeloma, Ewing's sarcoma, neuroblastoma, seminoma will not be entered into the&#xD;
        protocol unless their tumors have either responded to radiation or lie at spinal cord&#xD;
        levels that have already received maximal tolerable radiation doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with less than a 2 month life expectancy will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with symptomatic vertebral metastases at more than 3 spinal levels will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with asymptomatic vertebral metastases will be excluded.&#xD;
