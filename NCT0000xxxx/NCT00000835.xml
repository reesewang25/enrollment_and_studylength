  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV-1&#xD;
      pseudovirion vaccine given at one antigen dose alone and in combination with each of two&#xD;
      different adjuvants using two immunization schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pseudovirions are virus-like particles generated by in vitro production of HIV-1 viral&#xD;
      proteins which are capable of assembly into particles. The presence of gag gene products in&#xD;
      addition to envelope glycoprotein should assist in humoral and cellular immunologic responses&#xD;
      to internal HIV-1 viral proteins. The pseudovirion vaccine has been tested in preclinical&#xD;
      trials in mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates with good safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity profile.&#xD;

      addition to envelope glycoprotein should assist in humoral and cellular immunologic responses&#xD;

      trials in mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates with good safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 78 volunteers will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive pseudovirion&#xD;
      vaccine and/or the placebo/adjuvant. All volunteers will receive injections intramuscularly&#xD;
      at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (30 volunteers): pseudovirion vaccine w/adjuvant or w/o adjuvant. Group II (30&#xD;
      volunteers): pseudovirion vaccine w/adjuvant or w/o adjuvant. Group III (18 volunteers):&#xD;
      adjuvant (QS21 or alum) or saline placebo. NOTE: Group I will receive appropriate adjuvant or&#xD;
      saline placebo at Month 3 without pseudovirion vaccine.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of cancer unless there has been surgical excision followed by sufficient&#xD;
             observation period to give a reasonable assurance of cure.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Higher or intermediate risk sexual behavior as defined by the AVEG ( i.e., meeting the&#xD;

&#xD;
        Volunteers risk behavior for HIV infection will be determined upon information obtained&#xD;
