      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a monthly dosing regimen of&#xD;
      dexamethasone-a strong steroid medication-to treat patients with focal segmental&#xD;
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Patients with this disease have kidney fibrosis (scarring) and&#xD;
      proteinuria (excessive excretion of protein in the urine) that, in about half of the patients&#xD;
      eventually requires kidney dialysis or transplant. Currently, the most effective treatment&#xD;
      for FSGS is high-dose steroids (prednisone) taken daily for 4 to 6 months. However, only&#xD;
      about 30 percent of patients respond to this treatment, and it causes serious side effects in&#xD;
      many patients. Other drugs, such as cyclosporin and cyclophosphamide, improve proteinuria in&#xD;
      even fewer patients (about 10 percent) and also have serious side effects. This study will&#xD;
      explore whether a monthly pulse dose of steroids will achieve disease remission with less&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults and children with FSGS who: 1) have not received steroid treatment, or 2) could not&#xD;
      tolerate daily steroid treatment, or 3) relapsed after conventional steroid treatment may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Those enrolled will take dexamethasone by mouth for 4 days every 4&#xD;
      weeks for a total of 8 months. Patients will undergo various tests before treatment starts&#xD;
      (baseline), during the course of treatment, and in follow-up visits to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of treatment as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review of kidney biopsy, medical evaluation, measurement of total daily urine protein&#xD;
           excretion and kidney function, psychiatric testing for depression or other mood disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurements of blood pressure, blood chemistries and urine protein excretion - monthly&#xD;
           during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Questionnaire about the effects of treatment, if any, on mood and feelings - monthly&#xD;
           during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Photographs of the face and body (in underwear or shorts and tank top) to evaluate body&#xD;
           fat distribution- baseline and 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Eye examinations for cataracts and glaucoma - baseline and 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bone density scan (DEXA scan) of the lower spine and hip - baseline, 4 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hips&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Psychological evaluation and quality of life evaluation - baseline, 1, 2 and 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Blood tests for adrenal gland function - baseline, 4 and 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Blood and urine tests - 10, 12, 15, and 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who achieve remission (whose urine protein levels decrease to normal) before&#xD;
      completing the 8 months of dexamethasone will take one more dose and then stop therapy, but&#xD;
      continue with follow-up. Patients who achieve remission but relapse may be offered a second&#xD;
      course of treatment.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of an alternative&#xD;
      steroid dosing regimen for patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), using a&#xD;
      pilot study design that will enroll 20 patients. Although the literature reports variable&#xD;
      steroid responsiveness, remission rates of up to 30-40 percent have recently been reported in&#xD;
      nephrotic adult patients treated with daily prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day for at least 4 months,&#xD;
      followed by a taper over 3-4 months. Such a prolonged and aggressive steroid course is&#xD;
      fraught with significant morbidity, but this approach has been advocated by some authors&#xD;
      because of the poor prognosis for renal survival in nephrotic patients with FSGS who do not&#xD;
      achieve remission with steroid treatment. We plan to test an eight month course of high dose&#xD;
      steroid therapy administered in monthly pulses instead of daily doses, for comparable&#xD;
      efficacy in achieving remission, and for the occurrence of adverse steroid side effects. We&#xD;
      plan to enroll patients with nephrotic syndrome due to biopsy-proven FSGS, who have either&#xD;
      not been treated, or have responded to conventional steroid dosing regimens and relapsed. We&#xD;
      plan to treat them with monthly oral pulses of dexamethasone (40-60 mg/d x 4 days), for 8&#xD;
      months. The primary endpoint will be induction of complete remission, defined as urine&#xD;
      protein less than 300 mg/d. Patients will also be evaluated for manifestations of steroid&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients will be seen in follow up at intervals up to 24 months following study&#xD;
      entry. If this study suggests that remission of nephrotic syndrome can be attained with this&#xD;
      regimen, and with an acceptable toxicity profile, we will plan a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      of this regimen compared with daily or alternate day oral steroids.&#xD;
