  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and treatment of sleep disordered breathing have come to the forefront of&#xD;
      clinical medicine following recognition of the high prevalence and associated morbidity of&#xD;
      sleep apnea. The effects on quality of life as well as societal costs have been well&#xD;
      documented. The NYU Sleep Research Laboratory has spent the last several years working on the&#xD;
      problem of improving the diagnosis of mild sleep disordered breathing which manifests as the&#xD;
      upper airway resistance syndrome. Our approach has been to develop a non-invasive technique&#xD;
      to detect increased upper airway resistance directly from analysis of the airflow signal. A&#xD;
      characteristic intermittent change of the inspiratory flow contour, which is indicative of&#xD;
      the occurrence of flow limitation, correlates well with increased airway resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently all respiratory events are identified manually and totaled. This is time consuming&#xD;
      and subject to variability. The objective of the present project is to improve upon the&#xD;
      manual approach by implementing an artificially intelligent system for the identification and&#xD;
      quantification of sleep disordered breathing based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      signals collected during a routine sleep study. The utility of other reported indices of&#xD;
      sleep disordered breathing obtained during a sleep study will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful development of an automated system that can identify and classify upper airway&#xD;
      resistance events will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing, and greatly facilitate research and clinical work in this area. Using a&#xD;
      physiological based determination of disease should allow better assessment of treatment&#xD;
      responses in mild disease.&#xD;
