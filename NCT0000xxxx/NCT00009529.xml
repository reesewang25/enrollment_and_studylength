      To examine the effects of rigid gas permeable contact lenses on the progression of myopia&#xD;
      (nearsightedness) in children&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine what changes in the eyes cause certain eyes to progress in nearsightedness more&#xD;
      slowly&#xD;

      Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses provide clear, comfortable vision with relatively&#xD;
      few ocular health risks and are a standard management option for correcting nearsightedness.&#xD;
      While RGP contact lenses are used to correct myopic refractive error, they may also slow the&#xD;
      progression of myopia. A definitive study that could provide guidance regarding the effects&#xD;
      of rigid gas permeable contact lenses on myopia (nearsightedness) progression may define the&#xD;
      standard of care for slowing the progression of myopia in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An eye care practitioner first reported that hard contact lenses may slow or stop the&#xD;
      progression of nearsightedness in 1956. Other anecdotal clinical reports with similar results&#xD;
      soon followed. Previous review papers have suggested that rigid contact lenses slow the&#xD;
      progression of myopia in children, and several studies have attempted to prove this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies in the past twenty years have shown that rigid gas permeable contact lenses slow&#xD;
      the progression of nearsightedness in children, however both studies failed to provide proper&#xD;
      attention to many important variables. While these earlier works produced intriguing results&#xD;
      for scientists and clinicians, they contain many problems that challenge the significance of&#xD;
      the studies findings. The faults of the previous studies can be summarized in four&#xD;
      categories: 1) high losses to follow-up, 2) inadequate control group, 3) incomplete ocular&#xD;
      component measurements, and 4) inadequate or poorly selected entry criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive results in previous studies also failed to exclude alternate possibilities which may&#xD;
      explain why rigid gas permeable contact lenses may slow the progression of myopia. For&#xD;
      example, the studies found that rigid contact lenses slow the progression of myopia and that&#xD;
      corneal flattening accounts for some of the treatment effect, but none of the studies was&#xD;
      able to definitively answer other mechanisms that may slow myopia advancement. A need for a&#xD;
      controlled study of rigid contact lenses which measures all of the components that may affect&#xD;
      myopia progression still exists. The CLAMP Study examines all of these components and&#xD;
      addresses the problems encountered in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLAMP Study uses a run-in period to enroll only children who are able to adapt to rigid&#xD;
      contact lens wear into the study. This decreases the number of children who drop-out of the&#xD;
      study because they cannot adapt to rigid contact lens wear. Once children show that they are&#xD;
      able to wear rigid contact lenses, they are enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      wear rigid gas permeable contact lenses or soft contact lenses. Both groups are then examined&#xD;
      each year for three years to determine which group progresses the most in nearsightedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual examinations include assessment of the children's ability to focus their eyes, their&#xD;
      eye glass prescription, the length of their eyes, detailed maps of the shape and thickness of&#xD;
      their corneas (the clear window on the front of the eye), the shape of their eyes, and the&#xD;
      curvature of the lens inside the eye. Their eye glass prescription is determined when the&#xD;
      children's eyes are dilated. We examined 222 children for eligibility. Out of the 222&#xD;
      children, 148 were eligible to participate in the run-in period. Of the 148 eligible&#xD;
      children, 116 (78.5%) were able to adapt to rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. All of the&#xD;
      children were examined at The Ohio State University College of Optometry.&#xD;
