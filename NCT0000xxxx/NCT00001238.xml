    <textblock>
      We will investigate the clinical manifestations and molecular genetic defects of heritable&#xD;
      urologic malignant disorders. Families with urologic malignancy with known or suspected&#xD;
      genetic basis will be enrolled. Affected individuals or individuals suspected of having a&#xD;
      germline urologic malignant disorder will undergo periodic clinical assessment and genetic&#xD;
      analyses for the purpose of: 1) definition and characterization of phenotype, 2)&#xD;
      determination of the natural history of the disorder, and 3) genotype/phenotype correlation.&#xD;
      Genetic linkage studies may be performed in situations in which the genetic basis of the&#xD;
      disorder has not been elucidated.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disorders under investigation are: Autosomal dominant inherited urologic malignant&#xD;
           disorders including: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC),&#xD;
           Birt Hogg Dube (BHD) and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell acarcinoma (HLRCC) as&#xD;
           well as familial renal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies have led to the identification and characterization of the VHL, HPRC, FLCN and&#xD;
           HLRCC genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The genetic etiology of the most common type of inherited kidney cancer, familial renal&#xD;
           cancer (FRC), remains to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the natural and clinical histories of inherited urologic malignant&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the genetic etiology of hereditary urologic malignant disorders in which&#xD;
           the gene variation is unknown, by linkage analysis, positional cloning and evaluation of&#xD;
           candidate genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate specific mutations and their associated protein domains with disease&#xD;
           phenotypic expression based on parameters including presenting age, clinical&#xD;
           manifestations, histopathology and rate of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and describe as yet unknown or uncharacterized inherited urologic malignant&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals and biologic family members with a suspected or an established diagnosis of&#xD;
           an inherited urologic malignancy in which the disease gene is known, including von&#xD;
           Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals and biologic family members with a suspected or an established diagnosis of&#xD;
           an inherited urologic malignancy in which the disease gene is not yet known,&#xD;
           specifically hereditary forms of Type II papillary renal cancer, clear cell renal&#xD;
           carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, chromophobe renal carcinoma or Birt Hogg Dube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals and biologic family members who have urologic malignant diseases of&#xD;
           suspected, but not proven genetic etiology, including families with more than one&#xD;
           individual affected by the same or related cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These rare families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis, determine size&#xD;
           and location of renal tumors, size at presentation, growth rate and metastatic potential&#xD;
           of renal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations on the&#xD;
           relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease manifestations&#xD;
           and phenotype.&#xD;
