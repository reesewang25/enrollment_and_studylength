  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) methods for measuring changes in&#xD;
      the brain's blood flow during hypercapnia (a condition of excess carbon dioxide in the&#xD;
      blood). MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a large magnet and radio waves to produce images&#xD;
      of the body without X-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers in this study may have as many as six MRI scans over a 2-year&#xD;
      period. For this procedure, the person lies on a stretcher placed in a strong magnetic field&#xD;
      produced by the MRI machine. During the scan, the person's blood carbon dioxide (CO2 ) levels&#xD;
      will be increased either by: 1) breathing air mixtures containing up to 5% CO2; or 2)&#xD;
      receiving an intravenous (I.V.) injection of a drug called acetazolamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons who breathe CO2 will have their heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen levels&#xD;
      monitored throughout the procedure. Those receiving acetazolamide will have the drug injected&#xD;
      intravenously (I.V.) into an arm vein. If the volunteer experiences any unpleasant side&#xD;
      effects from the CO2 or acetazolamide, the study will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gained from this study will be used to develop better ways to study brain&#xD;
      function, possibly leading to better diagnostic and treatment methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in MR perfusion imaging have provided clinical researchers with the opportunity to&#xD;
      quantitate regional increases in cerebral blood flow. The purpose of this study is to acquire&#xD;
      the technical experience required to perform MR perfusion imaging studies of the hypercapnic&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow response. Cerebral blood flow will be increased by inhalation of carbogen&#xD;
      (an air mixture containing 5% CO2) or IV injection of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor&#xD;
      acetazolamide. The technical experience obtained in this study will be used to design a study&#xD;
      of the pharmacological and physiological mechanisms underlying cerebral blood flow increases&#xD;
      during hypercapnia.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any normal volunteer above the age of 18 years old who is capable of giving informed&#xD;
        consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they have contraindications to MR scanning, such as the&#xD;
        following: aneurism clip, implanted neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker or&#xD;
        autodefibrillator, chochlear implant, ocular foreign body (e.g., metal shavings), or&#xD;
        insulin pump. Also, subjects will be excluded if they have panic disorder or migrane&#xD;
        (because of possible complications with CO2 inhilation), or if they have cirrhosis, are on&#xD;
        high dose aspirin therapy, or have an allergy to acetazolamide injection). Subjects will be&#xD;
        excluded if they have allergies to sulfonamide drugs or if they have a chronic respiratory&#xD;
        illness.&#xD;
