      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Radioactive drugs such as holmium Ho 166 DOTMP can kill cancer&#xD;
      cells without harming healthy cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to&#xD;
      replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of melphalan with or without&#xD;
      holmium Ho 166 DOTMP followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients&#xD;
      who have multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of melphalan with or without holmium Ho 166 DOTMP&#xD;
      followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. II. Compare the response rate and overall survival of these patients treated with&#xD;
      these regimens. III. Compare the hematologic recovery rate and time to granulocyte&#xD;
      engraftment of these patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare the toxicity of these&#xD;
      regimens in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to their beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) test at initial diagnosis (B2M no greater than&#xD;
      4 mg/L vs B2M greater than 4 mg/L vs unknown B2M). Patients are randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms. Prior to stratification and randomization, patients receive a diagnostic dose&#xD;
      of holmium Ho 166 DOTMP within days -31 to -10. Patients with adequate skeletal uptake of the&#xD;
      diagnostic dose are randomized for therapy. Arm I: Patients receive holmium Ho 166 DOTMP IV&#xD;
      over no more than 10 minutes within days -10 to -7 (at least 1 week and no more than 3 weeks&#xD;
      after the diagnostic dose), melphalan IV over 20-30 minutes within days -3 to -1 (at least 24&#xD;
      hours prior to autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation), and autologous&#xD;
      PBSC transplantation on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive melphalan and autologous PBSC&#xD;
      transplantation as in arm I. Following transplantation, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)&#xD;
      daily until blood counts recover. Patients are followed at 1 year, every 6 months for 3&#xD;
      years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for&#xD;
      this study within 9 months.&#xD;
