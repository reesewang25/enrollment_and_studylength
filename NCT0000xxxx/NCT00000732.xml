  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the pharmacokinetics of low doses of zidovudine (AZT) (that is, how fast AZT&#xD;
      reaches the blood, what concentration of AZT is attained in the blood, and how long AZT&#xD;
      remains in the blood) changes from day-to-day in the same patient. Also to determine whether&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of AZT is changed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) given at&#xD;
      the same time or whether the pharmacokinetics of SMX/TMP is altered by AZT therapy. AZT has&#xD;
      been effective in treating some patients with AIDS, and SMX/TMP is an antibiotic combination&#xD;
      which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), which is an&#xD;
      important cause of disease and death in patients with AIDS. It is important to know how drugs&#xD;
      interact in patients because addition of a second drug may change the speed at which a drug&#xD;
      is eliminated from the body, and cause increased toxic effects or decreased therapeutic&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      AZT has been effective in treating some patients with AIDS, and SMX/TMP is an antibiotic&#xD;
      combination which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP),&#xD;
      which is an important cause of disease and death in patients with AIDS. It is important to&#xD;
      know how drugs interact in patients because addition of a second drug may change the speed at&#xD;
      which a drug is eliminated from the body, and cause increased toxic effects or decreased&#xD;
      therapeutic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients take AZT every 4 hours and/or SMX/TMP every 12 hours by mouth for 4 days as&#xD;
      outpatients and then come into the clinical research center for 2 days of studies. On day 5&#xD;
      the final dose of medicine is given orally (SMX/TMP) or by intravenous infusion (AZT). Blood&#xD;
      samples are drawn 10-20 times over a period of 12 hours and urine is collected for 36 hours.&#xD;
      Concentrations of the drugs in the blood and urine samples are determined. This sequence is&#xD;
      repeated twice, so that each patient takes AZT alone, SMX/TMP alone, and the combination of&#xD;
      AZT and SMX/TMP over a period of about 3 weeks. Patients may be included in the study if they&#xD;
      are asymptomatic, or have been diagnosed with ARC or AIDS, but not if they have PCP or any&#xD;
      other severe opportunistic infection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Zidovudine (AZT) for patients with AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AIDS related complex (ARC). The presence of any one of the following findings within&#xD;
             12 months prior to entry and the absence of a concurrent illness or conditions other&#xD;
             than HIV infection to explain the findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fever of &gt; 38.5 C degrees persisting for longer than 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involuntary weight loss of &gt; 15 lbs. or &gt; 10 percent of baseline noted in a 120-day&#xD;
             period prior to evaluation.&#xD;
