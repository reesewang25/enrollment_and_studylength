  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is an inherited disease which results in decreased&#xD;
      pigmentation (oculocutaneous albinism), bleeding problems due to a platelet abnormality&#xD;
      (platelet storage pool defect), and storage of an abnormal fat-protein compound (lysosomal&#xD;
      accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease can cause poor functioning of the lungs, intestine, kidneys, or heart. The major&#xD;
      complication of the disease is pulmonary fibrosis and typically causes death in patients ages&#xD;
      40 - 50 years old. The disorder is common in Puerto Rico, where many of the clinical research&#xD;
      studies on the disease have been conducted. Neither the full extent of the disease nor the&#xD;
      basic cause of the disease is known. There is no known treatment for HPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to perform research into the medical complications of HPS and&#xD;
      begin to understand what causes these complications. Researchers will clinically evaluate&#xD;
      patients with HPS of all ethnic backgrounds. They will obtain cells, blood components&#xD;
      (plasma), and urine for future studies. Genetic tests (mutation analysis) to detect&#xD;
      HPS-causing genes will also be conducted.&lt;TAB&gt;...&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease consisting of&#xD;
      oculocutaneous albinism, a platelet storage pool defect and, in some patients, lysosomal&#xD;
      accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin. Other manifestations include pulmonary fibrosis (often&#xD;
      fatal in the fourth or fifth decade), chronic granulomatous colitis and, rarely, renal&#xD;
      involvement or cardiomyopathy. There exist 10 different genes known to cause HPS, but only&#xD;
      HPS-2 and HPS-10 have a basic defect whose mechanism is known, i.e., defective subunits of a&#xD;
      coat protein, adaptor complex-3, responsible for intracellular vesicle formation. HPS-1 is a&#xD;
      severe genetic type common in northwest Puerto Rico, and HPS-3 is a milder one seen in&#xD;
      central Puerto Rico. HPS-4 resembles HPS-1 in severity; HPS-5 and HPS-6 resemble HPS-3 in&#xD;
      severity. HPS-7, HPS-8, and HPS-9 are extremely rare and have not been fully characterized.&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate individuals with HPS, perform mutation analysis&#xD;
      for known HPS-causing genes, search for variants in other genes responsible for HPS, and&#xD;
      obtain specimens to analyze basic mechanisms of HPS.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with HPS age 1-80 years are eligible to enroll in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of HPS is based upon a paucity or deficiency of platelet dense bodies on&#xD;
        whole mount electron microscopy or the identification of pathogenic variants in HPS genes&#xD;
        by genetic testing. Some subjects who have not been diagnosed with HPS may be admitted to&#xD;
        the protocol based upon the presence of albinism and a platelet storage pool deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Most female subjects who participate in the Obstetrics/Gynecology Questionnaire will be&#xD;
        enrolled in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with HPS or family members who are their caregivers participating in the HPS&#xD;
        Symptom Questionnaire will be at least 18 years of age. These subjects will enroll in the&#xD;
        protocol and will provide written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Infants under age one year are excluded because there is generally no urgency for a very&#xD;
        early diagnosis and care is more readily provided to older infants at the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women and adults who are unable to provide consent are excluded.&#xD;
