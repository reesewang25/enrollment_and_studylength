  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if treatment of MAC infection in HIV-1 infected persons is associated with the&#xD;
      decreases in plasma levels of TNF-alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection with MAC is a poor prognostic indicator in persons with AIDS. Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that this poor outcome is not simply a reflection of greater immune impairment in AIDS&#xD;
      patients with MAC infection, but rather may be a direct or indirect consequence of infection&#xD;
      with mycobacterium. Survival of AIDS patients with MAC is shorter than those without MAC.&#xD;
      Studies show that treatment for MAC improves the survival of MAC infected patients to nearly&#xD;
      the survival of AIDS patients without MAC. Treatment of MAC with clarithromycin containing&#xD;
      regimens is associated with decreased symptoms and prolonged survival. There is evidence,&#xD;
      however, that mycobacterial infection may enhance propagation of the human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus through mechanisms that may involve enhanced expression of pro inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
      It is unclear to what extent cytokine abnormalities contribute to this symptom complex and to&#xD;
      what extent treatment of MAC infection will reverse these cytokine abnormalities.&#xD;

      It is unclear to what extent cytokine abnormalities contribute to this symptom complex and to&#xD;
      what extent treatment of MAC infection will reverse these cytokine abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with MAC and who will initiate at least a 2 drug clarithromycin&#xD;
      containing MAC treatment regimen will be eligible for participation. Blood and urine will be&#xD;
      obtained from each patient at the following timepoints: Pre-Entry (within 7 days prior to&#xD;
      study entry), week 4, and week 8. Sites will process and ship specific samples to Case&#xD;
      Western Reserve University (CWRU). Various assays and analyses will be performed by CWRU.&#xD;
      NOTE: Patients will receive no treatment on this study, however, all patients must be&#xD;
      receiving at least a 2 drug clarithromycin containing treatment regimen for MAC either as&#xD;
      part of participation in other studies or as prescribed by the subject's health care&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;

        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have successfully completed therapy or be on stable therapy for any&#xD;
             acute infectious processes other than MAC prior to study entry.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Documented HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either symptomatic MAC disease as defined by a history of clinical signs and symptoms,&#xD;
             plus one blood culture positive for MAC or AFB obtained within the previous 90 days,&#xD;
