      To determine the incidence, secular trends, and outcomes of coronary heart disease in the&#xD;
      population of Rochester, Minnesota.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors may have contributed to the decline in coronary heart disease including revised&#xD;
      coding of death certificates, behavioral modification of risk factors, improvements in&#xD;
      emergency and other hospital care, and use of new medications and surgery. The Rochester&#xD;
      Heart Study contributed trend data covering the time before and during the decline in&#xD;
      coronary heart disease mortality. At that time, medical care for residents of Rochester and&#xD;
      Olmsted County was almost exclusively provided by the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Group.&#xD;
      Under the Rochester Epidemiology Program Project supported by program project grants from the&#xD;
      National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Institute of Arthritis and&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the medical records of the Olmsted Medical Group and&#xD;
      Community Hospital were indexed for retrieval by the same system as the Mayo Clinic. Those of&#xD;
      other outside sources such as the University of Minnesota Hospital, Rochester State Hospital,&#xD;
      and Veterans Hospitals which pertained to the occasional admission of Olmsted County&#xD;
      residents were also added to the Mayo Clinic maintained diagnostic index. The resulting&#xD;
      central diagnostic file gave virtually complete case assignments for diagnosed cases of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, sudden unexpected death, angina pectoris, and noncoronary heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The centralized case index of the Mayo Clinic and the Rochester Epidemiology Program Project&#xD;
      were used to identify any Rochester resident with a diagnosis between 1950 and 1987 of any&#xD;
      condition suggesting that coronary heart disease might be present. Included were diagnoses of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, or&#xD;
      arrhythmias. All relevant index codes were specified and a computer generated list was&#xD;
      provided of the unit record numbers of all candidate cases. The medical histories were then&#xD;
      retrieved and reviewed for inclusion. The screened histories were assigned to nurse&#xD;
      abstractors whose duty it was to identify from the screening list those patients who&#xD;
      satisfied the diagnostic criteria in the protocol as well as the incidence and residence&#xD;
      requirements. In case finding of coronary heart disease incidence, the following had to be&#xD;
      true: the diagnosis of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or sudden unexpected death must&#xD;
      have satisfied the protocol's diagnostic criteria; the diagnosis must have been a first&#xD;
      diagnosis; the patient, at the time of first diagnosis, must have been free of diagnoses of&#xD;
      congestive heart failure and valvular heart disease; the patient must have been a resident of&#xD;
      Rochester at the time of diagnosis. If all of these criteria were met, the electrocardiograms&#xD;
      were read by a physician for case verification. A precoded abstract of the history was&#xD;
      prepared for each incidence case. The abstract included: identification and demographic data;&#xD;
      information on smoking, hypertension, hypertension therapy, lipids, and use of estrogens;&#xD;
      diagnostic factors such as ECG, treatment tests, angiography, and selected laboratory test&#xD;
      results. The first myocardial infarction following the first coronary heart disease diagnosis&#xD;
      was coded; if the first manifestation of coronary heart disease was a myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      the second myocardial infarction was coded to provide a basis for determining reinfarction&#xD;
      rates. In the earlier study done from 1950-1969, little data on treatment were abstracted.&#xD;
      From 1970 to 1991t, drugs and surgery were abstracted. All death certificates for Rochester&#xD;
      and Olmsted County residents for the period 1960-1979 were recoded to the 8th revision of the&#xD;
      ICDA in order to obtain comparability over the study period. All deaths suspected of being&#xD;
      due to some form of coronary heart disease were reviewed by a group of cardiologists using a&#xD;
      clinical classification of death. The cardiologists used medical, hospital, and autopsy&#xD;
      records to determine cause of death. Follow up was 99 percent complete. Date of last&#xD;
      follow-up and cause of death were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical records for all Olmsted County residents ages 30 and over coming to autopsy for&#xD;
      the period 1950-1978 were reviewed. Data abstracted included date of death, age at death,&#xD;
      sex, weight, heart weight, grade of lesions in the coronary arteries, and evidence of recent&#xD;
      or old myocardial infarction. All autopsy records for 1980 through 1984 were reviewed for&#xD;
      coronary heart disease. Beginning in 1986, valvular heart disease data were also collected&#xD;
      for the period 1950 through 1987.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG) on incidence rates for coronary and&#xD;
      valvular heart disease was ascertained for all cases hospitalized after January 1, 1984. The&#xD;
      Mayo Medical Center DRG system which captured and retained diagnoses on hospitalized patients&#xD;
      was compared with the study medical index files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incident cases were also followed for specific diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. This&#xD;
      was accomplished by record review and by matching lists of case patient numbers with&#xD;
      identification numbers of patients who underwent the following: radionuclide ejection&#xD;
      fractions and radionuclide exercise tests beginning in 1980; arteriography, ventriculography,&#xD;
      valve evaluation, thrombolytic infusion, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty, and electrophysiologic testing beginning in 1976; coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      surgery, myocardial resection, and valve repair or replacement beginning in 1978; coronary&#xD;
      intensive care unit data beginning in 1976. New procedures were monitored as they came into&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
