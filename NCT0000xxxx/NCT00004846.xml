  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the accuracy of an experimental test method called nucleic acid&#xD;
      amplification technology (NAT) in detecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis&#xD;
      C virus (HCV). This test amplifies the nucleic acid in a virus more than a million-fold,&#xD;
      allowing early detection of minute quantities of virus in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood donors to the National Institutes of Health's Department of Transfusion Medicine (blood&#xD;
      bank) will have their blood screened with transcription mediated amplification, a type of NAT&#xD;
      test. Donors whose blood is found positive for HIV or HCV by NAT testing will be notified and&#xD;
      asked to participate in this study. Those who agree will provide a blood sample about once a&#xD;
      week for 3 months. The samples will be tested with additional assays to detect evidence of&#xD;
      HIV or HCV infection. If the test results are confirmed positive, no more blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected. The results of the tests and their significance will be explained to&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that NAT screening will reduce the risk of transfusion-related HIV&#xD;
      transmission from the current 1 in 650,000 to 1 in a million and the risk of HCV transmission&#xD;
      from the current 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 350,000. It is possible that these tests will&#xD;
      completely eliminate the risk of transmitting these diseases through blood transfusion.&#xD;

      In order to narrow the infectious period (window) between the time of viral exposure and the&#xD;
      time a virus can be serologically detected, blood centers throughout the United States are&#xD;
      implementing nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV and HCV. Early studies have shown that NAT&#xD;
      testing can significantly narrow the infectious window, particularly for HCV. There is the&#xD;
      potential that NAT testing could completely eradicate the transfusion risk of HIV and HCV.&#xD;
      The test is thus likely to add substantially to the safety of blood transfusions and,&#xD;
      although not licensed, has been implemented by all blood suppliers and transfusion services&#xD;
      in the United States. NAT testing is currently being used under an IND mechanism. The IND&#xD;
      stipulates that blood donors need to be informed through a supplemental information packet&#xD;
      that such testing is being performed and that if found positive they may be recalled for&#xD;
      additional testing. At the time of recall, an IRB approved study-specific informed consent is&#xD;
      administered and additional tests are performed to verify the initial NAT result. The&#xD;
      Department of Transfusion medicine is participating in this national validation of NAT&#xD;
      testing and will provide donor samples for centralized testing and statistical reporting to&#xD;
      FDA. The potential benefits of this testing for blood safety are great and the risk to donors&#xD;
      is considered minimal. Not seeking subjects for enrollment.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        All eligible, volunteer NIH blood donors will be tested by NAT. Thus, any donor who enters&#xD;
        the system and has blood drawn for viral testing will be a potential candidate for the&#xD;
        follow-up study if he/she tests NAT positive for HCV or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only potential donors who exclude themselves from the donation process will be excluded&#xD;
        from the study.&#xD;
