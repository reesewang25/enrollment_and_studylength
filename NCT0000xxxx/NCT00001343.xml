  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Turners Syndrome is a genetic condition in females that is a result of abnormal chromosomes.&#xD;
      Patients with Turner syndrome are typically short, have abnormal physical features, and lack&#xD;
      the physical changes normally associated with puberty. In addition, some patients with Turner&#xD;
      syndrome have low bone density (osteoporosis) and differences in learning abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will research the effects of steroid hormones on patients with Turner syndrome. It&#xD;
      will look closely at how taking steroid hormones effects the patient's rate of growth as well&#xD;
      as the patient's ability to learn. In addition the study will investigate how different&#xD;
      hormones (androgen and estrogen) work when given together as a combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients asked to participate in this study will receive growth hormone injections.&#xD;
      However, half of the patients will receive an additional sex steroid hormone (oxandrolone) in&#xD;
      the form of a pill. The other half of the patients will receive a placebo or &quot;sugar pill&quot;.&#xD;
      This will allow the researchers to determine if the combination of the hormones produces&#xD;
      different results than growth hormone alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last approximately 2 years. After 2 years of research the patients may qualify&#xD;
      for an additional 2 years of treatment. Patients may benefit directly from this research with&#xD;
      increased growth and improved ability to learn.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Turner syndrome is associated with short stature, multiple physical stigmata, and absent&#xD;
      pubertal development. We propose to: (1) examine the effects of sex steroids (androgen) on&#xD;
      multiple variables (growth rate, GH binding protein, IGF-I, and cognitive function), in the&#xD;
      setting of supplemental growth hormone administration and (2) to investigate any synergistic&#xD;
      or additive effects of the androgen and estrogen combination on the above variables.&#xD;
