      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sleep Apnea Syndrome consists of sleep-induced disturbances of breathing and&#xD;
      breathing-induced disturbances of sleep. Symptoms of pathologic sleepiness and, less&#xD;
      commonly, frequent awakenings and light sleep reflect the fragmentation of sleep by repeated&#xD;
      respiration-related arousals. Snoring, intermittent choking, and nocturnal dyspnea reflect&#xD;
      varying degrees of upper airway obstruction associated with Sleep Apnea Syndrome.&#xD;
      Observations of breathing during sleep show varying combinations and degrees of periodic&#xD;
      breathing, apneas, and hypoxemia. In more severe cases, cardiovascular complications,&#xD;
      including systemic and pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias, occur. The clinical&#xD;
      spectrum thus varies from the asymptomatic patient, to one with chronic cardiac and&#xD;
      respiratory failure who is at risk of sudden death. Most patients are disabled by varying&#xD;
      degrees of pathologic sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid increase of clinical activity with the Sleep Apnea Syndrome created an urgent need&#xD;
      for a more complete description of this condition. Clinical descriptions were derived from&#xD;
      case series of severely afflicted patients. Limited epidemiologic data, however, indicated&#xD;
      that symptoms and objective manifestations of Sleep Apnea Syndrome occurred commonly in the&#xD;
      population. It was unknown whether subjects with these findings were unrecognized patients,&#xD;
      premorbid individuals at risk, or normal subjects with no special impairments. There was a&#xD;
      need to define the frequency of signs and symptoms of Sleep Apnea Syndrome in the general&#xD;
      population, and to determine the health effects related to these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were recruited from a previous survey, the Belen Health Study, conducted from July&#xD;
      1984 through November 1985. Based on the data of the earlier survey, 421 subjects were&#xD;
      identified for recruitment and 275 actually participated. The Belen Health Study&#xD;
      questionnaire included items directed at Sleep Apnea Syndrome. Subjects for the sleep study&#xD;
      were selected based on responses to the initial questionnaire. For the sleep study, an&#xD;
      additional questionnaire was used, as well as new techniques of home monitoring of breathing&#xD;
      during sleep, and polysomnography to define the prevalence of symptoms and manifestations of&#xD;
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome. An assessment of the health effect of Sleep Apnea Syndrome was made by&#xD;
      reference to the demographic, socio-economic, and health data from the Belen Health Study.&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria and the utility of home monitors for clinical diagnosis were also&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
