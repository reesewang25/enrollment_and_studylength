  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test three experimental HIV vaccines. This study will look at&#xD;
      whether it is safe to give these vaccines together and how the immune system responds to the&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of studies being performed to test HIV vaccines. The vaccines that seem to&#xD;
      be the most promising are canarypox vaccines, known as ALVAC vaccines. The three experimental&#xD;
      HIV vaccines used in this study are called ALVAC-HIV vCP205, HIV-1 SF-2 p24, and HIV-1 SF-2&#xD;
      rgp120. The HIV-1 SF-2 p24 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 vaccines are mixed with an adjuvant, which&#xD;
      is a substance that increases immune response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently several Phase I and II clinical trials being performed within AVEG to&#xD;
      evaluate different HIV-1 vaccine candidates. The HIV-1 vaccination approach that is furthest&#xD;
      along the clinical development pathway is the so-called prime-boost regimen of live&#xD;
      recombinant canarypox priming (ALVAC-HIV vCP205) with recombinant subunit protein boosting&#xD;
      (HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 in MF59 adjuvant). The protein boost enhances neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      responses against laboratory strains of HIV-1 in assays performed in vitro, as well as&#xD;
      enhancing CD4 cell response and increasing the frequency of CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes&#xD;
      (CTLs). In all of the ALVAC-HIV trials of the prime-boost regimen completed to date, the&#xD;
      protein boost has been the HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 subunit protein. This study is designed to&#xD;
      explore whether boosting of live recombinant canarypox vaccination with a novel protein&#xD;
      subunit, recombinant HIV-1 SF-2 p24, can enhance the CD4 and CD8 cell responses directed&#xD;
      against HIV-1 antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are randomized to 1 of 5 groups. All volunteers receive a total of 4&#xD;
      immunizations, administered at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6. Each group receives a different&#xD;
      combination of vaccines as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus HIV-1 SF-2 p24. Group 2: ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus MF59 adjuvant&#xD;
      and citrate vehicle (control for HIV-1 SF-2 p24 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120) at Months 0 and 1;&#xD;
      then ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus HIV-1 SF-2 p24 at months 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus control at Months 0 and 1; then ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus HIV-1&#xD;
      SF-2 p24 combined with HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 at Months 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus control at Months 0 and 1; then ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus HIV-1&#xD;
      SF-2 rgp 120 at Months 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 5: ALVAC-RG vCP65 (control for ALVAC-HIV vCP205) plus control at Months 0,1,3, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study lasts for approximately 18 months; patients receive clinical evaluations to measure&#xD;
      vaccine safety at 11 study visits at specified time intervals.&#xD;
