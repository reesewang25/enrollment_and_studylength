    <textblock>
      To investigate whether women with Polycystic Ovary syndrome (PCOS) have evidence of an&#xD;
      increased prevalence rate of subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by the presence of&#xD;
      plaque, increased intima-medial carotid artery wall thickness and lower brachial artery flow&#xD;
      mediated vasodilation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is lower in women than men. This has been attributed&#xD;
      to differences in sex hormones, insulin sensitivity, and environmental factors. Women with&#xD;
      Polycystic Ovary syndrome have characteristics, including anovulation, hyperandrogenism and&#xD;
      insulin resistance, which suggests a male risk factor profile. The study tests the hypothesis&#xD;
      that women with PCOS are at greater risk of coronary heart disease than non-PCOS women. When&#xD;
      the study was initiated in 1991, there were few data available on long-term followup of women&#xD;
      with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in 1991, the investigators tested the hypothesis that women with PCOS, who comprise&#xD;
      5 percent of the female population, are at greater risk of coronary heart disease than&#xD;
      non-PCOS women. They traced and followed-up, via telephone interviews, 244 women with PCOS&#xD;
      and 244 age-matched neighborhood controls. They then conducted a cross-sectional study to&#xD;
      assess reproductive, hormonal and other coronary heart disease risk factors in the women with&#xD;
      PCOS compared with the controls. Evaluation consisted of an office visit to determine total&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, fasting and two hour glucose and insulin, blood&#xD;
      pressure, lifetime cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, reproductive history, lifetime&#xD;
      medication usage, family history of PCOS, and serum hormone concentrations. At this&#xD;
      evaluation, a physician diagnosis of PCOS from history, physical exam, and hormone studies&#xD;
      was made. In addition, information on the number of pregnancies, number of live births,&#xD;
      menstrual history, and history of surgical or natural menopause was obtained. Women with&#xD;
      evidence of thyroid, adrenal or pituitary disease were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grant was renewed in 1996 to determine whether women with PCOS have evidence of an&#xD;
      increased prevalence rate of subclinical atherosclerosis. Within the PCOS population the&#xD;
      investigators performed five studies to further determine risk factors for subclinical&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. First, they evaluated the relationship between PCOS and subclinical&#xD;
      atherosclerosis as measured by carotid ultrasound. In this study, they determined whether&#xD;
      women, thirty years of age or older with PCOS, had a higher prevalence of subclinical&#xD;
      atherosclerosis than age-matched control women. Second, they evaluated the relationship&#xD;
      between PCOS and subclinical vascular disease as measured by brachial artery flow mediated&#xD;
      vasodilation. They determined whether PCOS cases had lower brachial artery flow mediated&#xD;
      vasodilation than controls, and whether the distribution of flow mediated vasodilation was&#xD;
      related to the extent of carotid artery wall thickness and plaque. Third, they evaluated&#xD;
      whether subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular disease were related to the following&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors within PCOS cases and controls: HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and testosterone, waist-to-hip&#xD;
      ratio and body mass index (BMI). Fourth, they assessed differences in body composition&#xD;
      between PCOS cases and control women, including intra-abdominal fat as measured by computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) of the abdomen and sagittal diameter, and percent body fat as measured by&#xD;
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). They evaluated the relationship between subclinical&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and body composition separately for cases and for controls. Previous studies&#xD;
      had clearly shown that PCOS women were different from obese non-PCOS women. Moreover,&#xD;
      insulin, testosterone and coronary heart disease risk factors were also correlated with these&#xD;
      measures using paired t-tests. Multiple regression was used to test whether PCOS cases&#xD;
      compared to controls had an increase in intra-abdominal fat which was independent of&#xD;
      important confounders. Fifth, they compared plasma levels of selected coagulation factors&#xD;
      including fibrinogen and factor VII to fibrinolytic factors for PCOS cases and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in September 2000 through August 2004 to continue follow-up.&#xD;
