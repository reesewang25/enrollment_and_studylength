    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of giving lymphocytes (white blood cells) containing a&#xD;
      new gene to HIV-infected individuals and will determine how long the cells survive in the&#xD;
      bloodstream. Although the genetically altered cells will not directly benefit participants,&#xD;
      knowledge about the safety, side effects and survival of these gene-marked cells in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients may lead to new treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical twin pairs 18 years of age and older-one infected with HIV, the other&#xD;
      non-infected-may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a tetanus booster shot. Non-infected twins will undergo a&#xD;
      procedure called apheresis to collect white blood cells. For this procedure, whole blood is&#xD;
      collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood is separated&#xD;
      it into its components by centrifugation (spinning), the white cells are removed, and the&#xD;
      rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle or through another&#xD;
      needle in the other arm. The harvested white cells will be grown in culture for approximately&#xD;
      10 days to 2 weeks to increase their numbers up to 1000-fold. A gene called NeoR, which is&#xD;
      derived from bacteria, will be inserted into the cells, and these gene-marked cells will be&#xD;
      infused into the HIV-infected twin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected twins will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for the first cell infusion.&#xD;
      The gene-marked cells will be infused over a 60-minute period through a plastic tube&#xD;
      (catheter) placed in an arm vein, or, if a suitable arm vein cannot be found, through a&#xD;
      special catheter placed into a large vein in the neck or chest. Vital signs (temperature,&#xD;
      pulse, blood pressure and breathing rate), blood oxygen concentration, and urine output will&#xD;
      be monitored regularly for 24 hours. Blood samples will be collected before and after the&#xD;
      infusion to monitor for gene-marked cells. Patients will be discharged the next day. They&#xD;
      will return to NIH daily the first week (from Monday through Thursday) to monitor for CD4&#xD;
      cell counts, plasma viral burden, p24 antigen levels, HIV levels and the presence of the NeoR&#xD;
      gene, and then weekly for the next 5 weeks for these tests and others to monitor blood and&#xD;
      urine chemistry, blood counts and immune function markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the NeoR gene cannot be detected after the first cell infusion, the entire procedure&#xD;
      (donor apheresis, gene marking and infusion of cells) will be repeated twice-about once every&#xD;
      6 weeks. If the first infusion was uncomplicated, the second and third infusions may be done&#xD;
      on an outpatient basis, with monitoring for 6 hours rather than 24. Six weeks after the third&#xD;
      infusion, tests will be scheduled monthly for 6 months and then yearly for long-term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above procedures, patients with a baseline CD4 lymphocyte count less than&#xD;
      100 cells per cubic millimeter of blood will be asked to undergo apheresis periodically to&#xD;
      obtain the most accurate results for determining how long the NeoR gene persists in the&#xD;
      blood. The procedure will be done weekly for the first 6 weeks after each infusion of cells,&#xD;
      then at week 8, and then every 4 weeks until the gene can no longer be detected in the&#xD;
      lymphocytes. The schedule may change, but will not require more frequent apheresis.&#xD;

      This phase I/II pilot project will evaluate the survival, tolerance, safety, and efficacy of&#xD;
      infusions of activated, gene marked, syngeneic T lymphocytes obtained from HIV seronegative&#xD;
      identical twins on the functional immune status of HIV infected twin recipients. T cells from&#xD;
      each seronegative twin will be obtained by periodic apheresis, induced to polyclonal&#xD;
      proliferation with anti-CD3 and rIL-2 stimulation, transduced with distinctive neoR&#xD;
      retroviral vectors, and expanded 10-1,000 fold in numbers during approximately 2 weeks of&#xD;
      culture. These marked T cells will then be infused into the seropositive twins and the&#xD;
      survival of the uniquely marked T cell populations will be monitored by vector-specific PCR,&#xD;
      while the recipients' functional immune status is monitored by standard in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      testing protocols. A total of 3 cycles of treatment may be given at intervals of 6 weeks&#xD;
      between infusions.&#xD;
