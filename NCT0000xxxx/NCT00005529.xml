      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health risk appraisals (HRA) are being used increasingly by health centers and worksites to&#xD;
      inform people of their personal mortality and morbidity risks. However, recent research&#xD;
      suggests that many HRAs have limited reliability and validity with respect to coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, the leading cause of death in this country. Self-scored HRAs appear to be&#xD;
      considerably less accurate in predicting CHD risk than computerized instruments, chiefly&#xD;
      because people do not always know the physiologic values required by these instruments and&#xD;
      because they frequently make errors computing their scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase I, a new appraisal named CardioRisk was developed. The Phase I prototype version&#xD;
      contained eight major self-reported risk factors. CardioRisk predicted the risk of developing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a 12-year period using an equation based on recent&#xD;
      accelerated failure time models from the Framingham Heart Study. The purpose of Phase II was&#xD;
      to thoroughly test and refine the prototype instrument. The Phase II analyses were designed&#xD;
      to assess the psychometric properties of CardioRisk, to evaluate its utility as judged by&#xD;
      patients, and to determine whether the instrument changed perceptions of personal CVD risk.&#xD;
      These results were compared to data for other appraisals to determine whether CardioRisk&#xD;
      outperformed comparable products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed commercial application, CardioRisk would be distributed by health promotion&#xD;
      organizations to increase awareness of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Estimates&#xD;
      from the American Heart Association put the demand for these products at 180,000 HRAs per&#xD;
      year. The potential market for this product includes worksites, community health centers,&#xD;
      managed health care organizations, public health departments, and clinics.&#xD;
