  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a relatively simple, accurate method of diagnosing&#xD;
      sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a disease in which granulomas (nodules of inflamed tissue)&#xD;
      develop in various organs, such as the lungs, liver, skin and eyes. Disease symptoms vary&#xD;
      depending on the tissues involved. Many patients develop uveitis (eye inflammation). Tissue&#xD;
      biopsy-often a costly and difficult invasive procedure-is currently the only definitive&#xD;
      diagnostic test for sarcoidosis. Other tests, such as blood and urine tests, do not provide&#xD;
      definitive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with uveitis that is 1) known to be due to sarcoidosis; 2) suspected to be due to&#xD;
      sarcoidosis based on specific diagnostic criteria; and 3) known not to be due to sarcoidosis&#xD;
      may be enrolled in this study. Participants will undergo an eye examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      chest X-ray, and skin test for tuberculosis and other infections. Small tissue samples from&#xD;
      the conjunctiva (the thin lining covering the outside of the eye and the inside of the&#xD;
      eyelid) and the lacrimal (tear) gland will be taken after the eye is numbed with anesthetic&#xD;
      drops and injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will examine and compare levels of certain proteins in the biopsied tissues&#xD;
      from the three patient groups to see if elevated levels of these substances may indicate&#xD;
      granuloma formation. Development of a new, relatively simple diagnostic test for sarcoidosis&#xD;
      based on these findings may permit doctors to start appropriate therapy earlier in the course&#xD;
      of disease without invasive biopsy.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to develop a method of diagnosing sarcoidosis in patients with&#xD;
      presumed sarcoid uveitis. We plan to test conjunctival and lacrimal gland biopsy specimens&#xD;
      from three groups of patients: patients with known, biopsy proven sarcoidosis, patients with&#xD;
      suspected sarcoidosis, and patients with uveitis of an etiology other than sarcoidosis.&#xD;
      Specimens will be tested for presence of cytokines, cell surface markers, and specific T cell&#xD;
      receptor gene elements with immunohistochemical techniques using monoclonal antibodies. It&#xD;
      has been shown that the diagnostic value of conjunctival and lacrimal gland biopsy looking&#xD;
      for the presence of non-caseating granuloma in the absence of discrete nodules is low.&#xD;
      Assaying for cytokines, cell surface markers, and specific T cell receptor gene elements may&#xD;
      provide a more sensitive and specific diagnostic test for sarcoidosis in patients with&#xD;
      presumed sarcoid eye disease.&#xD;
