      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A finding from the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS), a clinical trial,&#xD;
      indicated that common carotid intima-media thickness responded more rapidly and more markedly&#xD;
      to LDL-C lowering treatment than angiographic coronary stenosis or carotid roughness. New&#xD;
      data from a primate model also showed ultrasound detection of intimal thickening in response&#xD;
      to a hypercholesterolemic diet within twelve months. These findings suggest that carotid IMT&#xD;
      is a reliable and rapidly responding marker of extent of atherosclerosis. However, less than&#xD;
      a third of the observed therapeutic benefit on carotid IMT found in CLAS was explained by&#xD;
      change in LDL-C and HDL-C, suggesting that related (or other) factors are more directly&#xD;
      linked to atherogenic mechanisms. In addition, a Finnish epidemiologic study found that LDL-C&#xD;
      was predicative of rate of progression in carotid IMT only in persons with high serum levels&#xD;
      of (pro-oxidant) copper. . These and other data support a model of atherosclerosis in which&#xD;
      intracellular accumulation of modified LDL is promoted/retarded by serum&#xD;
      pro-oxidants/antioxidants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tested the specific hypotheses that the positive association between rate of&#xD;
      increase in carotid IMT and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta deltaIMT/LDL) was&#xD;
      greater in persons with [1] higher levels of serum pro-oxidants (relative to persons with&#xD;
      lower levels of serum pro-oxidants), [2] lower levels of serum antioxidants, [3] lower levels&#xD;
      of dietary antioxidants; and [4] that regression of carotid IMT associated with smoking&#xD;
      cessation would be detected in 30 months. Hypothesis were tested with the longitudinal&#xD;
      observation of carotid IMT in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women and men. The inclusion of&#xD;
      Hispanics and women was motivated by their prevalence in the study population (18 percent&#xD;
      Hispanic, 40 percent women), and by the then recent report that incidence of hospitalization&#xD;
      for myocardial infarction was elevated in Hispanics. Seventy three persons from each of four&#xD;
      ethnicity-sex groups aged 40-60 years (n-292), and 83 smokers and recent quitters (n-166)&#xD;
      were recruited from employees in an ongoing study. Baseline blood, diet and potential&#xD;
      confounder variables were related to 18 and 36 month (6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 month in smoker(s)&#xD;
      changes in carotid IMT. Levels of antioxidant vitamins, including alpha-tocopherol,&#xD;
      ascorbate, and beta carotene, in the plasma were measured at baseline. Plasma levels of&#xD;
      negatively charged LDL were measured in a sub-sample of subjects with the most rapidly&#xD;
      progressing common carotid intima-media thickness and in an age-sex matched subsample with&#xD;
      the least rapidly progressing common carotid intima-media thickness. Finally, an ultrasound&#xD;
      measurement of carotid arterial stiffness, another indicator of early atherosclerosis, was&#xD;
      developed to address the role of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Los Angeles Atherosclerosis Study (LAAS) has been renewed through February, 2004 to&#xD;
      continue follow-up of the cohort for a total of seven years with two additional measures of&#xD;
      arterial dysfunction, including endothelial function of the brachial artery and&#xD;
      distensibility or stiffness of the common carotid artery.&#xD;
