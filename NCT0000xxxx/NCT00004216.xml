      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as VNP20009 use different ways to stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system and stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VNP20009 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of intratumoral live,&#xD;
      genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium (VNP20009) in patients with refractory,&#xD;
      superficial solid tumors. II. Determine the efficacy of VNP20009 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive intratumorally injected live,&#xD;
      genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium (VNP20009) on day 0. The tumor is biopsied on day&#xD;
      14. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP20009 until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) or the optimal biologic dose (OBD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      highest dose in which no more than 1 patient in a cohort of 6 experiences dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT). The OBD is defined as the dose at which 3-6 patients of a cohort have greater&#xD;
      than 10 million colony-forming units of VNP20009 per gram in the tumor biopsy. Prior to&#xD;
      reaching the OBD, 2 to 3 additional patients may be entered at a previous dose level shown to&#xD;
      be safe to undergo biopsy of the injected lesion between days 5 and 8. Patients are assessed&#xD;
      for systemic tumor response 4-5 weeks after treatment. If the injected lesion is stable or&#xD;
      responding, and non-injected lesions have not grown, patients may receive up to 2 additional&#xD;
      courses of treatment. Patients receive one of the following antibiotic regimens upon evidence&#xD;
      of progressive disease, DLT, or discontinuation from the study: First line: Ciprofloxacin IV&#xD;
      or orally every 12 hours on day 1 then orally twice a day for 18 days Second line:&#xD;
      Ceftriaxone IV on day 1 then cefixime orally for 16 days Third line: Co-trimoxazole orally&#xD;
      twice a day for 21 days Patients are followed for an additional 4 weeks after initiation of&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-40 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
