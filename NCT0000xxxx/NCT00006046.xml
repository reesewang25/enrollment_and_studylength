      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver&#xD;
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients who have advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal&#xD;
           antibody hu3S193 in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the immune response in these patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive monoclonal antibody hu3S193 (mAb hu3S193) IV over 30 minutes to 4 hours&#xD;
      weekly for 8 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients with stable or responding disease at&#xD;
      week 10 receive maintenance mAb hu3S193 weekly. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of mAb hu3S193 until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.&#xD;

    <description>Toxicity was graded in accordance with the Common Toxicity Scale developed by NCI (1998) where Grade 1 represents the lowest toxicity grade and Grade 5 death. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events which were at least possibly related to study treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response (CR); disappearance of all measurable disease lasting a minimum of 4 weeks. Partial Response (PR); 50% or greater decrease in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters or all measurable lesions, without development of new lesions or increase in size of any lesion, lasting a minimum of 4 weeks. Progressive disease (PD); Appearance of new lesions or increase by 25% or more in size of any measurable lesion. Stable disease (SD); Not meeting criteria for response or progression.</description>
