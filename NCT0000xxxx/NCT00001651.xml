  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how quickly white blood cells called CD4 lymphocytes replicate&#xD;
      (divide) and how long they live in both HIV-infected and non-infected people by measuring how&#xD;
      quickly the genetic material (DNA) of cells is replicated. To do this, participants will&#xD;
      receive infusions of glucose, a non-radioactive form of a type of sugar. Cells normally use&#xD;
      glucose to make various products needed for cell growth and replication, including cell DNA.&#xD;
      Measuring how much glucose cells incorporate into their DNA can provide important information&#xD;
      about cell replication. This rate of incorporation will be examined and compared in&#xD;
      HIV-infected people and in healthy, normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients and non-infected healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a continuous infusion of glucose at a dose of up to 60 grams&#xD;
      (about 2 ounces) per day for up to 5 days. The glucose will be delivered through a catheter&#xD;
      (thin plastic tube) placed in an arm vein. Blood samples will be collected as often as daily&#xD;
      in the first week following the infusion and then from twice a week to once a month for up to&#xD;
      4 years. Alternatively, patients may undergo leukapheresis a procedure for collecting&#xD;
      quantities of lymphocytes up to 10 times during the first month after the infusion, and&#xD;
      possibly later as well, but no more often than once every 2 weeks. For this procedure, whole&#xD;
      blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine&#xD;
      that separates it into its components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood&#xD;
      is returned to the body either through the same needle or through a second needle in the&#xD;
      other arm. Participants may be asked to receive up to four glucose infusions. There will be&#xD;
      at least a 2-week interval between infusions. Participants who have more than three&#xD;
      leukapheresis procedures within 3 weeks will have at least 6 weeks between infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed periodically in the outpatient clinic for evaluation and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may provide a better understanding of how HIV causes disease and progressive&#xD;
      weakening of the immune system and how therapies affect immunity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding the rate of lymphocyte replication and destruction in HIV-infected patients, as&#xD;
      well as the effects of therapy on lymphocyte replication should lead to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms behind the immunodeficiency induced by HIV. To examine this&#xD;
      directly, up to 100 HIV-infected patients will receive up to 5 days of continuous infusions&#xD;
      with [6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose, a nonradioactive, stable isotope of glucose that is safe to&#xD;
      administer. The deuterium is incorporated into DNA via metabolism of glucose to ribose and&#xD;
      incorporation into nucleotides. The rate of incorporation can be measured in subpopulations&#xD;
      of cells to determine the rate of replication of those cells. Fifty HIV-uninfected persons&#xD;
      will also be enrolled in the protocol to allow a determination of lymphocyte kinetics in&#xD;
      individuals with normally functioning immune systems or immune systems that may have been&#xD;
      affected by other diseases. All participants in this study will be reimbursed for the&#xD;
      inconvenience and discomfort associated with study participation.&#xD;
