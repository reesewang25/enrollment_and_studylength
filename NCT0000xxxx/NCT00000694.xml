      To define the best doses of sargramostim ( granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor;&#xD;
      GM-CSF ), interferon alfa-2b ( IFN-A2b ), and zidovudine ( AZT ) to give together in patients&#xD;
      with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS ), to learn about the side effects of these drugs&#xD;
      when they are given together for 8 weeks, and to find out whether the combination of GM-CSF,&#xD;
      IFN-A2b, and AZT has any effect on KS, HIV, or the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies show that IFN-A2b can cause KS tumors to shrink or disappear in about 30 percent of&#xD;
      patients. IFN-A2b can greatly reduce the growth of the HIV virus in test tube experiments and&#xD;
      perhaps in patients. AZT has also been shown to reduce the growth of HIV and show&#xD;
      improvements in the immune system with fewer infections. Test tube experiments show that when&#xD;
      IFN-A2b and AZT are used together, they reduce the growth of the HIV virus much more&#xD;
      effectively than when either drug is used alone. In recent studies of the combination of&#xD;
      interferon alpha and AZT in patients with KS, more than 40 percent of the patients showed&#xD;
      shrinkage of their tumors, and some showed evidence for suppression of HIV growth in the&#xD;
      body. However, the combination of IFN-A2b with AZT often caused a marked lowering of the&#xD;
      white blood cell (WBC) count, especially a type of WBC called the granulocyte (or neutrophil)&#xD;
      which is important in the body's defense against infection. Recombinant human GM-CSF is a&#xD;
      human protein which is produced in bacteria. It has been shown to cause an increase in the&#xD;
      WBC count.&#xD;

&#xD;
      AMENDED: 900910 to allow one patient to be treated beyond one year. Original design: GM-CSF,&#xD;
      IFN-A2b, and AZT are given every day for 8 weeks. There are 6 patients per dose level.&#xD;
      IFN-A2b and GM-CSF are given in two separate injections under the skin (subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection) once a day. AZT is given orally every 4 hours (6 times/day). The first patients&#xD;
      are given doses of the drugs that are quite well tolerated when given alone. If these dosages&#xD;
      are tolerated without serious side effects, the dosage of IFN-A2b is increased in subsequent&#xD;
      groups of patients. Maintenance treatment consisting of the same dose received at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the initial 8 week course of treatment will be resumed with eligible patients&#xD;
      for up to 1 year.&#xD;
