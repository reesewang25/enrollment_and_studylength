  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To expand the safety information regarding MN rsgp 120/HIV-1 formulated with QS21 or alum. To&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity of low doses of MN rsgp 120/HIV-1 formulated with QS21 or alum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies to date indicate that there may be a dose-sparing effect with the use of QS21. In&#xD;
      animal studies, when QS21 has been employed as an adjuvant, it shifted both the dose response&#xD;
      curve and allowed less antigen to elicit equivalent binding antibody titers to the rgp120&#xD;
      protein. There may also be an acceleration in the course of antibody response after both the&#xD;
      first and the second immunizations. Although the final titers in response to vaccine given in&#xD;
      both alum and QS21 appear similar after 3 doses in humans, this plateau may be reached more&#xD;
      readily, and with a lower antigen dose, when using QS21 as an adjuvant. In addition, it has&#xD;
      been established that using a lower dose of antigen may elicit an immune response which is&#xD;
      characterized by lymphoproliferation and production of TH1-like cytokines such as INF-gamma,&#xD;
      interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-5 and interleukin-10.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited and screened and those determined as eligible will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. Initially, 5 patients will be randomized into each combination of MN rsgp&#xD;
      120/HIV-1 dose and adjuvant, QS21 or alum, along with 2 controls for each adjuvant group. An&#xD;
      additional 10 patients will be randomized equally between the QS21 and alum arms to the&#xD;
      lowest dose group having 2 or more responders defined as an MN Vital Dye neutralization titer&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 10 measured at 2 weeks after the second vaccination. 1 additional&#xD;
      control will also be randomized to each adjuvant group. If neither dose has 2 or more&#xD;
      responders, no additional patients will be enrolled. Patients will receive their randomly&#xD;
      assigned injections at months 0, 1 and 6. Patients will be tested for DTH to MN rsgp 120 at&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
