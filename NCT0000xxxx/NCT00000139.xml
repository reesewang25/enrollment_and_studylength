      To determine whether early treatment (with oral acyclovir) of herpes simplex virus (HSV)&#xD;
      ulcerations of the corneal epithelium prevents progression to the blinding complications of&#xD;
      stromal keratitis and iridocyclitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of low-dose oral acyclovir in preventing recurrent HSV eye&#xD;
      infection in patients with previous episodes of herpetic eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the role of external factors (such as ultraviolet light or corneal trauma) and&#xD;
      behavioral factors (such as life stress) on the induction of ocular recurrences of HSV eye&#xD;
      infections and disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection of the eye by herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a leading cause of corneal blindness in&#xD;
      the United States and other countries. The infection can lead to corneal scarring and&#xD;
      neovascularization, permanent endothelial dysfunction and corneal edema, secondary glaucoma,&#xD;
      and cataract. Despite the availability of topical antiviral agents that are highly active&#xD;
      against HSV keratitis, there is still no known effective method for reducing the frequency of&#xD;
      recurrence or severity of stromal keratitis and iridocyclitis. In addition, the prognosis is&#xD;
      poor for recovery of good vision following penetrating keratoplasty for actively inflamed or&#xD;
      highly vascularized herpetic corneas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of both animal and human studies, the antiviral agent acyclovir may both treat&#xD;
      and prevent recurrence of HSV disease. However, no consensus yet exists on the use of&#xD;
      acyclovir in the management and prevention of herpetic eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEDS-II consists of two randomized, placebo-controlled trials that are assessing the role of&#xD;
      oral acyclovir in the management of herpetic eye disease and one epidemiologic study that is&#xD;
      investigating risk factors, including stress, for the development of ocular recurrences of&#xD;
      the disease. The organizational structure consists of a national coordinating center, eight&#xD;
      regional coordinating clinical centers, and approximately 60 clinical sites. The clinical&#xD;
      sites where patients are enrolled and followed include both university-based and&#xD;
      community-based practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herpes Simplex Virus Epithelial Keratitis Trial: HEDS-EKT evaluated the benefit of oral&#xD;
      acyclovir given during treatment of an acute HSV keratitis (dendritic or geographic&#xD;
      keratitis) in preventing the occurrence of later blinding complications. Patients entered the&#xD;
      trial within 7 days of onset. All patients received standard treatment with a topical&#xD;
      antiviral and were randomized to receive either oral acyclovir (400 mg five times a day for&#xD;
      21 days) or a placebo. Patients had eight visits within a 12-month followup period. The&#xD;
      primary outcome was the time to the first occurrence of stromal keratitis or iridocyclitis in&#xD;
      the study eye (eye with epithelial keratitis at time of study entry). The HEDS-EKT&#xD;
      recruitment goal was 502 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acyclovir Prevention Trial: HEDS-APT evaluated the benefit of long-term acyclovir treatment&#xD;
      in patients with a recent history of HSV eye disease but no current active disease. To be&#xD;
      eligible, a patient must have experienced any kind of ocular herpes simplex infection&#xD;
      (blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or iridocyclitis) in the preceding year. The&#xD;
      infection must have been inactive and untreated for at least the previous 30 days. Patients&#xD;
      were randomized to receive either oral acyclovir (400 mg twice a day) or placebo for 1 year.&#xD;
      Five followup visits occurred during the 1-year treatment period and an additional three&#xD;
      followup visits during the 6-month post-treatment period. Episodes of recurrent HSV eye&#xD;
      disease during the trial were treated with topical corticosteroids and antivirals as&#xD;
      indicated, but patients continued to receive the oral acyclovir or placebo for the entire&#xD;
      365-day period. The primary outcome was the time to the first recurrence of any type of HSV&#xD;
      eye disease in either eye. The recruitment goal was 696 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular HSV Recurrence Factor Study: HEDS-RFS is evaluating the effect of psychological,&#xD;
      environmental, and biological factors on recurrences of herpetic eye disease. Patients&#xD;
      recruited into the HEDS-APT trial are eligible to participate in HEDS-RFS if they are 18&#xD;
      years or older. At entry, all subjects fill out a questionnaire to estimate the negative&#xD;
      affectivity trait measure. Subjects also fill out a short questionnaire every week for 52&#xD;
      weeks to track acute and chronic stressors (e.g., illnesses, injuries, menstrual periods, sun&#xD;
      exposure, emotional and financial stresses). The investigators ensure patient privacy by the&#xD;
      patient's mailing of the weekly logs directly to the HEDS National Coordinating Center.&#xD;
