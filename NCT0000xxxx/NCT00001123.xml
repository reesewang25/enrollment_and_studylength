  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to test the safety and effectiveness of intravenous ribavirin therapy in&#xD;
      persons with suspected and subsequently proven hantavirus infection. The hantavirus is spread&#xD;
      through the air into the lungs when dry rodent feces are moved or disturbed. It is&#xD;
      characterized by fever and bleeding.&#xD;
