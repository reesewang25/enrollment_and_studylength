      The purpose of this study is to see if adding 1 or 2 drugs to the anti-HIV therapy of&#xD;
      patients whose HIV levels increased while taking their anti-HIV drugs can lower viral load&#xD;
      (amount of HIV in the blood) and keep it low up to Week 24. (This study has been changed.&#xD;
      Previously, only patients whose levels increased on their first round of anti-HIV drugs were&#xD;
      being studied.) Anti-HIV drug treatments that contain a combination of 3 or more drugs can&#xD;
      lower HIV levels, raise CD4 cell counts, and improve survival. Unfortunately, many patients&#xD;
      &quot;fail&quot; their anti-HIV drug treatment when their HIV levels go above 500 copies/ml. Usually&#xD;
      the next step is to switch the patient to different anti-HIV drugs. Doctors would like to see&#xD;
      whether adding 1 or 2 different drugs to the &quot;failed&quot; treatment also can lower HIV levels.&#xD;
      Adding 1 or 2 drugs might be better than switching all of the drugs since patients who take&#xD;
      many different drugs can develop drug-resistant HIV. (This study has been changed.&#xD;
      Previously, only patients taking protease inhibitors (PI) whose levels increased on their&#xD;
      first round of anti-HIV drugs were being studied.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful therapy following viral rebound has been problematic. Intensification of the&#xD;
      existing regimen by adding 1 or 2 drugs generally has been avoided. However, successfully&#xD;
      adding new drugs to an existing regimen would be advantageous since it would expose the&#xD;
      patient to fewer antiretroviral agents in the overall treatment course. Recent evidence&#xD;
      suggests that a significant proportion of patients who experience viral rebound while&#xD;
      receiving a protease inhibitor (PI) actually have viral rebound with a PI-sensitive virus.&#xD;
      Other studies have shown that treatment decisions based on resistance assays result in better&#xD;
      virologic outcomes. This trial examines further the effect of resistance assay-directed&#xD;
      intensification of a PI-containing antiretroviral regimen on viral load. [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      04/03/01: The antiretroviral regimen need not contain a protease inhibitor.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified by baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (5,000 copies/ml or less versus&#xD;
      greater than 5,000 copies/ml). Patients undergo phenotypic drug resistance testing prior to&#xD;
      study entry. Based on the phenotypic results, patients are [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00:&#xD;
      selectively] randomized equally to 1 of 3 [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00: 1 of 2] intensification&#xD;
      strategies while remaining on their current, initial [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00: (background)]&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/03/01: ART need not be initial.] A patient&#xD;
      is excluded from randomization to an arm if that arm contains a drug to which the patient has&#xD;
      phenotypic resistance. Arm A adds abacavir (ABC). Arm B adds amprenavir (APV) [AS PER&#xD;
      AMENDMENT 11/9/00: and ritonavir (RTV)]. Arm C adds didanosine (ddI) plus hydroxyurea (HU).&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00: Arm C has been discontinued.] A patient's HIV must be sensitive to&#xD;
      at least 3 drugs. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00: Each patient must be taking at least 3 drugs to&#xD;
      which his/her HIV isolate is sensitive, including ABC or APV and at least 2 other drugs that&#xD;
      are part of the current, initial (background) ART. If phenotypic resistance testing at&#xD;
      screening indicates resistance to a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug in&#xD;
      the patient's current, initial (background) ART, then the local investigator may choose to&#xD;
      discontinue that drug. However, the patient and local investigator may choose to continue the&#xD;
      drug but it will not be considered an active drug per this protocol.] [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      04/03/01: ART need not be initial.] Patients have regular clinic visits for physical exams&#xD;
      and blood tests, including CD4 and CD8 cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA assays, and tests for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic variability. In the event of viral rebound of 500 copies/ml or more at Week&#xD;
      12 or later, phenotypic/genotypic drug resistance is assayed. In addition, phenotypic drug&#xD;
      resistance is assayed at the primary endpoint (Week 24) and at the end of treatment (Week 48)&#xD;
      on all patients.&#xD;
