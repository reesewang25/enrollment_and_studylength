      This study will test the ability of an experimental vaccine to increase the number of&#xD;
      tumor-fighting immune cells (lymphocytes) in patients with localized prostate cancer and&#xD;
      prevent the disease from recurring following radiation therapy. The vaccine is intended to&#xD;
      stimulate lymphocytes to target and attack cells containing a protein called prostate&#xD;
      specific antigen, or PSA. It is composed of the following parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rV-PSA: Vaccinia virus plus human DNA that produces PSA (prostate specific antigen)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rV-B7.1: Vaccinia virus plus human DNA that produces B7.1 (a protein that helps guide&#xD;
           immune cells to their targets)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rF-PSA: Fowlpox virus plus human DNA that produces PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GM-CSF: Drug that boosts the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-2: Drug that boosts the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer confined to the prostate who have&#xD;
      received a smallpox vaccine sometime in the past and who do not have a history of allergy to&#xD;
      eggs may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a complete medical history&#xD;
      and physical examination, blood tests, and skin tests (similar to those for allergies or&#xD;
      tuberculosis) to assess immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive one of the following three treatments: Group 1&#xD;
      - standard radiation therapy plus the experimental vaccine; Group 2 - standard radiation&#xD;
      therapy without the vaccine; Group 3 - standard radiation therapy with the vaccine, but with&#xD;
      a different dose of IL-2 from Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the vaccine groups receive injections in the arm or thigh in 28-day treatment&#xD;
      cycles, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GM-CSF: Days 1 through 4 of the first week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-2 5: for Group 1, 5 days in the second week of each cycle; for Group 3, 14 days&#xD;
           beginning in the second week of each cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rV-PSA and rV-B7.1: Day 2 of the first cycle only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rF-PSA (booster shots): Every 28 days, beginning day 2 of the second cycle (i.e., days&#xD;
           30, 58, 86, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment continues for eight cycles unless serious side effects develop, PSA levels rise&#xD;
      significantly, or the doctors feel there is no reason to continue therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo radiation therapy and possibly hormone therapy, if indicated. Blood&#xD;
      samples are drawn once a week for the first month and then once every 4 weeks to monitor&#xD;
      safety. After treatment ends, patients are followed with examinations and blood tests every 3&#xD;
      months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months until the doctors determine follow-up is&#xD;
      no longer needed or the cancer returns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have HLA tissue typing at the beginning of the study. Those who are type HLA-A2&#xD;
      are asked to have additional procedures for studying the immune response that can be done&#xD;
      only with this tissue type. This involves collecting blood samples before treatment begins,&#xD;
      every 4 weeks during treatment, once after cycle 2, and once 4 months after the eighth&#xD;
      vaccine. They also undergo four leukapheresis procedures for collecting white blood cells.&#xD;
      For leukapheresis, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating a&#xD;
      unit of blood. The blood flows through a machine that separates it into its components. The&#xD;
      white cells are removed, and the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body,&#xD;
      either through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;

      This trial will evaluate the immunologic effects of a vaccination regimen in HLA-A2 positive&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients. Eligible patients will have localized prostate cancer and be&#xD;
      willing to undergo definitive local radiotherapy. 30 patients will be randomized in a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio into two cohorts (see schema below) with patients in the vaccine arm receiving&#xD;
      vaccination before, during and after primary standard radiotherapy (external beam alone or in&#xD;
      combination with brachytherapy). When enrollment to these two cohorts is complete, enrollment&#xD;
      will begin with up to 19 (9-10 HLA-A2 positive) patients to a third, non-randomized vaccine&#xD;
      cohort. This cohort C will differ from the first vaccine cohort only in the IL-2 dose and&#xD;
      schedule. The vaccine regimen will be composed of (1) a recombinant vaccinia virus that&#xD;
      expresses the Prostate Specific Antigen gene (rV-PSA), admixed with (2) a recombinant&#xD;
      vaccinia virus that expresses B7.1 costimulatory molecule (rV-B7.1); followed by (3)&#xD;
      sequential vaccinations with recombinant fowlpox virus containing the PSA gene (rF-PSA). All&#xD;
      patients on the vaccine arms will, in addition, receive sargramostim and aldesleukin as part&#xD;
      of their vaccination schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to identify immunologic response as measured by in vitro analysis of&#xD;
      the patients peripheral blood cells. The immune response of cohorts A and B will be analyzed&#xD;
      at various times to determine whether a specific immune response can be affected by the&#xD;
      vaccination as well as whether radiotherapy has an effect on that immune response. The serum&#xD;
      PSA will be followed as a secondary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with PSA-expressing adenocarcinoma of the prostate will be evaluated for&#xD;
      eligibility that includes a history of prior vaccinia (as vaccine against smallpox) and&#xD;
      immunocompetence.&#xD;
