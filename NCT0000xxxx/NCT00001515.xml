      This study will evaluate a new technique for examining the air passages of the lungs called&#xD;
      &quot;virtual bronchoscopy.&quot; It involves using computed tomography (CT) images of the chest to&#xD;
      generate a 3-dimensional model of the walls of the trachea and bronchi (airway passages).&#xD;
      This non-invasive method lets doctors see small masses and areas of narrowing in the passages&#xD;
      without having to do surgery or pass a tube through them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diseases of the air passages who are enrolled in an NIH clinical trial may&#xD;
      participate in this study, which requires having a CT scan. The patient lies on a table that&#xD;
      slowly slides into a hole in a donut-shaped X-ray machine (the scanner). Patients may have to&#xD;
      hold their breath several times during the procedure. Some patients may be given an injection&#xD;
      of a contrast agent through a catheter (thin tube) placed in an arm vein to improve&#xD;
      visibility of abnormalities. Patients may also be asked to breathe oxygen through nasal&#xD;
      prongs to allow them to hold their breath longer. The procedure usually takes 15 to 20&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;

      This project is a test of the efficacy of a new diagnostic method for imaging the airways&#xD;
      known as virtual bronchoscopy. Virtual bronchoscopy is performed by acquiring thin section&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) images of the chest. These images are used to generate a three&#xD;
      dimensional model of the tracheal and bronchial walls on a graphics workstation in 3-D. The&#xD;
      model can be manipulated to allow the viewer to &quot;fly through&quot; the tracheobronchial tree&#xD;
      providing views similar to those obtained during bronchoscopy. The technique produces a&#xD;
      display of the human bronchial system in a readily understood format. Moreover, it allows&#xD;
      investigation of post-stenotic portions of the bronchial tree that are beyond the reach of&#xD;
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Further, virtual bronchoscopy may be used to guide interventional&#xD;
      procedures. The patients that will be studied in this protocol will be those having&#xD;
      inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic pulmonary processes who would have had a chest CT for&#xD;
      clinical reasons. These patients will be recruited from current NIH protocols. The study&#xD;
      design consists of scanning of the thorax using thin section helical CT, followed by three&#xD;
      dimensional surface rendering of the airways and transfer of the digital data to videotape.&#xD;
      In one of four parts of the protocol, the virtual bronchoscopy will be compared with results&#xD;
      from fiberoptic bronchoscopy in a blinded study. In a second part of the protocol, the&#xD;
      virtual bronchoscopy will be used to perform a descriptive analysis of cavitary lung lesions.&#xD;
      In the third part, the utility of virtual bronchoscopy in diagnosis of neoplastic lesions of&#xD;
      the chest will be studied. In the fourth part, certain technical problems in the virtual&#xD;
      bronchoscopy procedure will be investigated. The patients will only have fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscopy for clinically indicated purposes. We anticipate that virtual bronchoscopy will&#xD;
      be diagnostically efficacious for disorders which produce a morphologic alteration in&#xD;
      bronchial anatomy.&#xD;
