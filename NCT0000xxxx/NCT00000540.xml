      To test the hypothesis that implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy will improve&#xD;
      survival in coronary heart disease patients at high risk of death, especially arrhythmic&#xD;
      death.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management strategies are urgently needed for the problem of sudden cardiac death, the most&#xD;
      common single, non-accidental cause of death in adults in North America. Many consider that&#xD;
      the problem of sudden cardiac death has reached epidemic proportions. Contemporary&#xD;
      prophylactic management of sudden cardiac death includes identification of high risk&#xD;
      populations, based on underlying structural heart disease, degree of left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction, and evidence of a ventricular arrhythmia propensity. Populations with the&#xD;
      highest sudden death cardiac risk, notably those patients resuscitated from spontaneous&#xD;
      episodes of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, have been used as test populations for&#xD;
      the development of effective prophylactic approaches. However, in such populations, ethical&#xD;
      considerations have precluded the use of untreated control groups. Furthermore, such patients&#xD;
      comprise only a small proportion of the total patient population that could benefit from an&#xD;
      effective prophylactic strategy. The largest 'at-risk' group are those patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease and depressed left ventricular function who have, but have not yet expressed,&#xD;
      a ventricular tachyarrhythmia propensity. The major advantages of a controlled trial of&#xD;
      prophylactic therapy in the latter population are evaluation of sudden death prophylaxis in&#xD;
      the larger 'at-risk' population and the opportunity to do so with an untreated control group.&#xD;
      The 'window of opportunity' for such comparisons has been closed in resuscitated patients for&#xD;
      some time and is in danger of closing in the larger population. The total absence of&#xD;
      controlled efficacy data for ICD use despite 30,000 implanted units of this expensive&#xD;
      technology argues strongly for the timely acquisition of controlled data in the larger&#xD;
      population before the therapy is embraced any further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, non-blind. Patients were randomized during surgery for coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      graft to receive ICD or not, and followed and censored at 42 months at 35 centers. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The trial described morbidity of ICD treatment,&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of ICD therapy on quality of life, and compared health care costs of ICD&#xD;
      treatment to those in the control group. Anti-arrhythmic treatment of unsustained arrhythmia&#xD;
      was prohibited; anti-arrhythmic drug use, when indicated, was documented; and aspirin was&#xD;
      prescribed unless contraindications existed. Recruitment was extended through December 1995&#xD;
      in order to accrue 900 patients, instead of the original 800 projected. As of February 1996,&#xD;
      900 patients had been recruited. In April 1997, the DSMB recommended that the trial be&#xD;
      stopped because there was sufficient evidence to conclude that there was no difference&#xD;
      between the treatment and control groups. Follow-up was extended for two years beyond the&#xD;
      original termination date.&#xD;
