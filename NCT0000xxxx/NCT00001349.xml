  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect blood plasma and white blood cells for laboratory research using a&#xD;
      procedure called apheresis. Apheresis is a method of collecting larger quantities of certain&#xD;
      blood components than can safely be collected through a simple blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 7 years of age and older with a parasitic infection or condition associated with a&#xD;
      parasitic infection (i.e., elevated levels of IgE antibodies or of a type of white cell&#xD;
      called eosinophils) who are currently enrolled in a NIH clinical research protocol may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Relatives of patients and normal healthy volunteers will also be&#xD;
      enrolled. Candidates will have a medical history, physical examination and blood tests.&#xD;
      Individuals weighing less than 25 kilograms (55 pounds) may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo one of the following two apheresis procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated pheresis Whole blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein and&#xD;
           circulated through a cell separator machine. The plasma (liquid part of the blood) and&#xD;
           white cells are extracted, and the red cells are re-infused into the donor through a&#xD;
           needle in the other arm. The procedure takes 1 to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manual pheresis Whole blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein and&#xD;
           circulated through the cell separator machine. The red blood cells are separated from&#xD;
           the rest of the blood and returned to the donor through the same needle. Usually only&#xD;
           one needle stick is required and the procedure takes from 30 to 45 minutes. This method&#xD;
           is used only in individuals who weigh less than 35 kg (77 pounds).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to carry out in vitro research procedures on the plasma or leukocyte components of&#xD;
      blood, it is often necessary to obtain larger quantities of plasma and/or leukocytes, than&#xD;
      can be safely obtained by simple phlebotomy. These components can be easily and safely&#xD;
      obtained using apheresis procedures in the Clinical Center Apheresis Unit. This protocol is&#xD;
      specifically designed to conform to the requirements of the Apheresis Unit for donors to have&#xD;
      apheresis procedures (&gt;7 years of age and greater than or equal to 25kg). Donors must first&#xD;
      be admitted to another approved clinical research protocol of the LPD, NIAID before they may&#xD;
      have the apheresis procedures described in this protocol. The investigational nature of the&#xD;
      studies in which the samples will be used, as well as the risks and benefits of the donation&#xD;
      process will be explained to all donors, and a signed informed consent document will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;

      Leukocytes, platelets and plasma will be collected. Since this protocol only allows for&#xD;
      apheresis to be performed on participants enrolled on another LPD protocol, any biological&#xD;
      samples collected will be covered by the other, individual protocol on which the participant&#xD;
      is enrolled.&#xD;
