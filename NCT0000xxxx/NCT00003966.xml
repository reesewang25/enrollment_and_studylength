      RATIONALE: Giving defibrotide may be an effective treatment for liver damage that may result&#xD;
      following peripheral stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying defibrotide to see how well it works in&#xD;
      treating patients with severe liver disease after undergoing peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine complete response rate in post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients&#xD;
           with severe veno-occlusive disease of the liver treated with defibrotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the minimal effective dose of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess toxicity and adverse side effects of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. All patients initially receive the same&#xD;
      dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on day 1. On day 2, patients are randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 doses of defibrotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: On days 2-14, patients receive a lower dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours every&#xD;
           6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: On days 2-14, patients receive a higher dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours&#xD;
           every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients (70 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Jaundice (bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL) and 2 or more of the following: ascites, weight&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Patients with jaundice and reversal of flow on Doppler examination of the&#xD;
                       portal vein will be eligible with one of the following: ascites, weight gain&#xD;
                       &gt; 5% above baseline weight, hepatomegaly, RUQ pain&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with pre-existing hepatomegaly must have documentation by physical&#xD;
                       exam or imaging that liver size is increased over baseline at admission&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who do not meet the criteria in Section 3.1.1 (ie. have two of the major&#xD;
                  criteria but not three) and have biopsy proven VOD are eligible in the presence&#xD;
                  of characteristics consistent with severe disease (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with concurrent, confounding causes of liver dysfunction clinically&#xD;
                  evident or evident on ultrasound or other radiographic imaging (such as evidence&#xD;

                  VOD and/or elevated wedged trans-hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement (&#xD;
                  ≥10 mm mercury) to be considered eligible. Best medical judgment and further&#xD;
                  imaging studies can be used to clarify the diagnosis and determine confounding&#xD;
                  causes of liver dysfunction.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients who meet Grade IV common toxicity criteria for neurotoxicity (other than&#xD;

               -  Please note that an experimental agent in this setting is defined as any drug or&#xD;
                  device used under an IND designation which is associated with systemic effects&#xD;
                  that could influence the outcome in a patient with severe VOD. If the continued&#xD;
                  use of an experimental agent is considered both necessary and appropriate, this&#xD;
                  must be reviewed and approved on a case by case basis by the Overall Study PI,&#xD;
                  Dr. Paul Richardson, or his designate, who will approve the entry of patients&#xD;
                  being concurrently treated with another experimental agent only if there is no&#xD;
                  evidence for a potential adverse pharmacokinetic interaction or overlapping&#xD;
                  toxicity.&#xD;
