    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with or without medication has been used in the treatment of&#xD;
      panic disorder (PD). The purpose of this study is 1) to determine whether nine months of&#xD;
      maintenance cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) significantly improves the likelihood of&#xD;
      sustained improvement; and 2) to determine the acute acceptability and efficacy of medication&#xD;
      therapy or continued CBT alone among patients who fail to respond sufficiently to an initial&#xD;
      course of CBT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been found that patients with PD respond as well to CBT or medication alone as they do&#xD;
      to a combination of the two. Since the combined treatments are expensive and CBT is&#xD;
      associated with less risk of medical toxicity compared to medications, CBT alone will be used&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will first receive CBT alone. If the patient responds to this therapy, the&#xD;
      patient will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. One group will&#xD;
      continue to receive CBT (maintenance therapy) for 9 months. The other group of responders&#xD;
      will not receive any further therapy. If a patient does not respond to CBT alone, he/she will&#xD;
      be assigned randomly to 1 of 2 different groups. One group will receive paroxetine; the other&#xD;
      will continue to receive CBT for a longer period. The response to treatment will be evaluated&#xD;
      to see which regimen works best to treat PD. The study will last approximately 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual may be eligible for this study if he/she has panic disorder with no more than&#xD;
      mild agoraphobia (fear of being in public places) and is at least 18 years old.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if maintenance CBT produces a more sustained improvement among patients with&#xD;
      panic disorder (PD) who respond to an initial course of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      alone. For those who do not respond sufficiently to CBT alone, to determine if the addition&#xD;
      of pharmacotherapy is acceptable and if this improves response among those inadequate&#xD;
      responders to CBT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter study builds upon the findings of a prior study comparing imipramine,&#xD;
      placebo, CBT, and their combination in the treatment of PD patients with no more than mild&#xD;
      agoraphobia. That study found response rates were as high with CBT or imipramine alone as&#xD;
      with their combination. Given the added cost of combined treatments, it therefore seems&#xD;
      reasonable to begin with monotherapy. Further, following general principles of medical&#xD;
      practice, it would be reasonable to initiate treatment with the less invasive cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral intervention. It is then important to learn what should be done following initial&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients initially receive CBT alone. Patients are then randomized into 1 of 2 post-acute&#xD;
      studies, depending on response status. Responders are randomized to a maintenance study&#xD;
      comparing no maintenance with 9 months of continued CBT. Nonresponders are randomized to a&#xD;
      study comparing paroxetine with continued CBT. The following outcomes will be examined: the&#xD;
      necessity of maintenance therapy in maintaining response; the ability of adjunct&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy to improve the response of patients who did not respond to CBT alone;&#xD;
      possible predictors of response and relapse; and possible mediators of response.&#xD;
