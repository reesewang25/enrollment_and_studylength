      To establish in children born prematurely a set of links between lung function in late&#xD;
      infancy and lung function at school age, between lung function at school age and that in&#xD;
      adolescence, and between lung function in adolescence and that in adulthood in order to&#xD;
      evaluate pulmonary outcomes of neonatal therapeutic strategies and to relate these strategies&#xD;
      to lung health in adult life.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective perinatal treatment strategies during the past 20 years have increased the survival&#xD;
      of low birth weight infants. Accompanying this increased survival has been a 4-6 fold&#xD;
      increase in the number of children surviving with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, although the&#xD;
      birthweight specific incidence has remained constant or declined. Limited data currently&#xD;
      available indicate that individuals who had BPD as infants have, as childrearing adults,&#xD;
      impaired lung growth as well as both fixed and reversible airways obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of an Institute-initiated program on Collaborative Projects in Women's&#xD;
      Health. The concept was developed by the NHLBI staff and given concept clearance at the&#xD;
      February 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Applications&#xD;
      was released in April 1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of a four-grant collaborative project on women's health. Based on&#xD;
      available data, Dr. Mary Ellen Wohl hypothesized that bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)&#xD;
      morbidity was related to impaired lung growth in the first year of life, did not improve&#xD;
      during adolescence and was accentuated in females because of their intrinsically smaller&#xD;
      lungs. To test this hypothesis, she measured lung size and airway function in teenagers and&#xD;
      young adults, previously studied at school age, who were born, 1) at term, 2) prematurely, 3)&#xD;
      developed respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn (RDS) or 4) developed BPD. Children&#xD;
      born from 1987-89 previously studied at 10 months of age by novel lung function function&#xD;
      methods developed in this laboratory were restudied at school age. Techniques of measuring&#xD;
      total respiratory system compliance and resistance and of obtaining forced expiratory flow at&#xD;
      functional residual capacity were applied to cohorts of born premature infants at 10-18&#xD;
      months of age to assess outcome of current perinatal strategies.&#xD;
