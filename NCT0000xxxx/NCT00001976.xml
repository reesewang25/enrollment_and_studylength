      This study will evaluate the reliability of a new test called Real-Time Polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (RT PCR) in detecting cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the blood and predicting the course&#xD;
      of CMV disease in patients who have recently had a bone marrow transplant. The test's&#xD;
      effectiveness will be compared with that of the &quot;pp65 antigenemia assay&quot; now routinely used&#xD;
      for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV is a common virus that is transmitted from person to person by close personal contact. In&#xD;
      most healthy people, CVM can remain in the body indefinitely without causing any harm. But,&#xD;
      in people with weakened immune systems-including those who have just undergone bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant-CMV infection can cause serious, and possibly fatal, complications. Drugs are&#xD;
      available to treat this infection, however. Optimum treatment depends on early and accurate&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 10 to 80 years who are scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplant at the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center as part of an NIH protocol may be eligible for this 2-phase study. In phase&#xD;
      1, patients will have blood drawn for both RT PCR and antigenemia testing once before the&#xD;
      bone marrow transplantation and then weekly for the first 100 days after the transplant.&#xD;
      During Phase 2-which begins immediately after the end of phase 1 and continues for one year&#xD;
      after the transplant-blood samples for both tests will be drawn up to once a week. The&#xD;
      samples for both tests will be collected at the same time and will be taken through a&#xD;
      catheter (a thin flexible tube inserted into a vein) that has already been placed for the&#xD;
      transplant study. RT PCR testing will require an extra 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) above what&#xD;
      is needed for antigenemia testing, amounting to a maximum of about one-half pint extra over&#xD;
      the course of the 1-year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the new RT PCR test will prove to be more accurate in detecting CMV&#xD;
      infection and predicting disease development, thus enabling doctors to plan early and&#xD;
      effective treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, it is the standard of care to use the pp65 antigenemia assay to guide&#xD;
      anti-cytomegalovirus therapy in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      over the past two years at our institution, only approximately 10% of antigenemia-positive&#xD;
      patients went on to develop overt CMV disease and only 22% of patients with documented&#xD;
      clinical CMV disease had a positive antigenemia test in the two weeks prior to diagnosis&#xD;
      (data on file).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a test called CMV Real-Time PCR has been applied to the diagnosis of CMV infection.&#xD;
      Preliminary data suggests that this test may be of value in detecting active CMV replication.&#xD;
      Thus, it may be able to predict CMV disease and help guide antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a prospective observational study comparing CMV Real-Time PCR test and pp65&#xD;
      antigenemia. This will be done by taking an extra blood sample (approximately 5 mL) for the&#xD;
      CMV Real-Time PCR test from hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients whenever a sample for&#xD;
      the pp65 antigenemia test is drawn. No separate venipunctures are anticipated. These samples&#xD;
      will be drawn on an approximately weekly basis during the first 100 days post-transplant, as&#xD;
      is currently done for the pp65 antigenemia test alone. Additionally, at any time blood is&#xD;
      drawn for the pp65 antigenemia test after 100 days, we will also take blood for the CMV&#xD;
      Real-Time PCR test, up to one year post-transplant. The results of the CMV Real-Time PCR test&#xD;
      will not be used to guide therapy. Overt CMV disease will be identified via real-time chart&#xD;
      review and patient interviews by one of the investigators in the study. The primary goal of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate the ability of the CMV Real-Time PCR test to accurately detect&#xD;
      active CMV viral proliferation and predict ultimate overt CMV disease as compared to the&#xD;
      currently-used pp65 antigenemia test.&#xD;
