  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if zidovudine (AZT) and acetaminophen (APAP) interact when given to the same&#xD;
      patient, and if so, the manner of interaction. Patients with AIDS often require therapy with&#xD;
      painkillers for the management of mild pain and discomfort associated with their disease, and&#xD;
      APAP is often prescribed. AZT is being used to treat AIDS patients. It is important for&#xD;
      doctors to understand how AZT and APAP may interact when given to the same patient, because&#xD;
      other studies have suggested that the dosage of AZT may have to be adjusted when given with&#xD;
      APAP in order to avoid or minimize adverse effects.&#xD;

      Patients with AIDS often require therapy with painkillers for the management of mild pain and&#xD;
      discomfort associated with their disease, and APAP is often prescribed. AZT is being used to&#xD;
      treat AIDS patients. It is important for doctors to understand how AZT and APAP may interact&#xD;
      when given to the same patient, because other studies have suggested that the dosage of AZT&#xD;
      may have to be adjusted when given with APAP in order to avoid or minimize adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons who are infected with HIV and have symptoms (fever, fatigue, weight loss) of AIDS are&#xD;
      eligible for the study. They will be given AZT orally every 4 hours or APAP orally every 8&#xD;
      hours alone or in combination for 4 days while at home. On the 4th day, participants will be&#xD;
      admitted to a clinical research center for studies to determine how they are tolerating the&#xD;
      medicine. On the 5th day, any scheduled 8 am doses of AZT will be given intravenously, while&#xD;
      the scheduled doses of APAP will still be given orally. Repeated blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      over the next 12 hours and urine will be collected for 24 hours. The process will be repeated&#xD;
      at weekly intervals for 3 weeks, so that each patient receives AZT alone, APAP alone, and the&#xD;
      combination of AZT and APAP.&#xD;

             cryptococcal or toxoplasmosis meningoencephalitis, disseminated herpes simplex or&#xD;
             herpes zoster. A demonstrated prior sensitivity or an experience of significant&#xD;
             adverse effects during prior therapy with the drug to be used in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        AIDS related complex (ARC) defined as presence of any one of the following within 12 months&#xD;

&#xD;
        HIV infection to explain the findings:&#xD;

          -  Patients eligible for zidovudine under the labeling. A positive HIV antibody test.&#xD;
             Exceptions will be made for patients with a previously positive HIV antibody test with&#xD;
             progressive disease and patients where virus isolation has been made. A life&#xD;
             expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
