  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine late effects of treatment for sarcoma (bone and soft tissue cancers)&#xD;
      in children. Survival of patients with these diseases has improved over the years, but&#xD;
      long-term adverse effects of treatment have also been noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients previously treated for sarcoma in the NCI's Pediatric Oncology Branch who are in&#xD;
      their first remission from sarcoma after completion of therapy and who have had no further&#xD;
      cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, cancer related surgery or immunotherapy)&#xD;
      for at least 24 months may be eligible for this 3- to 4-day study. It will review the&#xD;
      incidence and extent of the following late effects of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart problems-The chemotherapy drug doxorubicin can cause acute and late injuries to&#xD;
           the heart muscle. Patients will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart to&#xD;
           look for changes and compare the findings with information obtained by standard&#xD;
           echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart) and by MUGA (nuclear medicine scan of the&#xD;
           heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gonadal dysfunction-The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide may affect sex hormone&#xD;
           production, leading to infertility, early menopause or brittle bones. Low sex hormone&#xD;
           levels may also increase the risk for heart attack, obesity or fracture. Patients will&#xD;
           have blood tests to measure hormone levels as well as mineral levels, lipid levels and&#xD;
           blood cell counts. They will also have a DEXA scan to measure bone mineral density and a&#xD;
           CT scan of the abdomen to evaluate the distribution of fatty tissue in the abdomen.&#xD;
           Males will be offered a semen analysis as part of the fertility evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychosocial problems- Cancer diagnosis and treatment pose a major life stress that can&#xD;
           lead to problems with personal relationships, jobs, insurance, education, health care,&#xD;
           and personal and professional goal setting. Some patients may become depressed or&#xD;
           develop a psychiatric illness. Patients will fill out a questionnaire about their&#xD;
           treatment, recovery, and aspects of their current life and will meet with a psychologist&#xD;
           and psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in bodily function and capabilities-Patients who undergo surgery and radiation&#xD;
           to treat sarcoma treatment may experience muscle, bone and joint changes. Patients will&#xD;
           be interviewed about their performance of daily activities, physical limitations, and&#xD;
           changes in skill levels. They will do a series of exercises and will have measurements&#xD;
           of strength, mobility and physical skills, focusing on the parts of the body that were&#xD;
           affected by the sarcoma and subsequent local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposure to viruses-A number of patients received blood transfusions as part of their&#xD;
           cancer treatment. Some transfusions were given before HIV screening became available.&#xD;
           Patients will be tested for this virus as well as the hepatitis virus and HTLV-1 (human&#xD;
           T-cell leukemia virus-1), for which there are also small transfusion-associated risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney function-The chemotherapy drug ifosfamide may affect kidney function. Patients&#xD;
           will provide a urine specimen for kidney function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune function-Chemotherapy affects the function of infection-fighting immune cells&#xD;
           called T-lymphocytes. A blood sample will be drawn for studies of the time involved in&#xD;
           recovering full immune function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Childhood cancers mark a relatively infrequent disease entity with an annual age adjusted&#xD;
      rate in children age 0-14 years of 14 per 100,000. Over the last 30 years a striking increase&#xD;
      in survival due to improved diagnosis and aggressive treatment approaches has vastly enhanced&#xD;
      the outlook in this patient population. 75% of children under 15 years age of can be expected&#xD;
      to survive the diagnosis of cancer for more than 5 years. However, reports of improved&#xD;
      survival have been followed by increasing awareness of a multitude of long-term&#xD;
      treatment-related side effects, in addition to an overall death rate 9.6 times higher than in&#xD;
      the sex- and age-matched general population. Over the last 35 years, patients with pediatric&#xD;
      sarcomas have been treated in the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) of the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute. Since 1971 adriamycin and cyclophosphamide in escalating doses have been&#xD;
      incorporated in all multimodality treatment protocols. Ifosfamide became an integral part of&#xD;
      therapy in 1986. The survival rate of patients with these diseases has improved over this&#xD;
      period of time. Accordingly there exists a group of long-term survivors of therapy employed&#xD;
      in a series of POB sarcoma protocols who represent a valuable source of information on&#xD;
      treatment-associated late-effects, e.g. cardiotoxicity, gonadal dysfunction, growth delay and&#xD;
      stress-related neuroendocrine abnormalities. In addition there may be evaluable&#xD;
      rehabilitative impairments and alterations in psychosocial behavior that may only manifest&#xD;
      over time, and prove to be characteristic for this population. This protocol will&#xD;
      systematically enumerate and describe the incidence and extent of treatment related long-term&#xD;
      toxicities in this patient population.&#xD;

        protocol and treated according to POB outlines for the treatment of sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chemotherapy delivered according to one of previous POB trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be either in first continued remission from sarcoma after completion of&#xD;
        therapy, or in continued remission of more than 5 years after completion of salvage therapy&#xD;
        for disease relapse.&#xD;

        Patients must have had stable disease greater than 24 months or be NED by history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be able to travel to NCI/POB. Alternatively, subjects may consent on a separate&#xD;
        consent document to the mail-in questionnaire component of the study only, which will not&#xD;
        require travel to the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be able to understand and sign consent. Minors must be accompanied by a parent or&#xD;
        guardian legally permitted to give consent. Written assent will be obtained from all minors&#xD;
        age 12 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Negative pregnancy test in all female patients. Pregnant or lactating women are ineligible&#xD;
        for study enrollment while they are pregnant or lactating, but may be enrolled at a later&#xD;
        point once these conditions have ceased to exist. For eligible subjects consenting to&#xD;
        participation in the mail-in questionnaire component of the study only, a urine pregnancy&#xD;
        test will not be required.&#xD;
