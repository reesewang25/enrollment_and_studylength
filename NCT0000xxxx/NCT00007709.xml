      It is suspected, but not well documented, that persons with severe mental illness (SMI)&#xD;
      represent a significant transmission source of serious infectious diseases. SMI diagnoses are&#xD;
      defined as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD). Severely mentally ill persons are at high risk for Human Immunodeficiency&#xD;
      Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS). To assess the risk of HIV and related&#xD;
      infections among these individuals, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Office on&#xD;
      AIDS funded the HIV/SMI five site collaborative study &quot;Assessing HIV/AIDS and Associated&#xD;
      Health Risks in People with Severe Mental Illness&quot;. This Durham ERIC study supplements the&#xD;
      NIMH HIV/SMI study with a four-year longitudinal cohort study of 300-plus SMI veterans in&#xD;
      order to estimate the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and HIV infection, as well as to&#xD;
      measure utilization of health services over time. The Durham VA is the only VA site&#xD;
      represented in the study and is collaborating with four non-VA sites including Dartmouth,&#xD;
      University of New Hampshire, University of Connecticut and Duke University. As such, we have&#xD;
      the additional goals of investigating health and health-care-service issues relevant to&#xD;
      veterans with SMI and of establishing a database for the longitudinal study of veterans with&#xD;
      SMI.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives: To determine the prevalence of HIV and other related infections such as&#xD;
      Hepatitis C, along with associated risk behaviors, in patients with severe mental illness&#xD;
      (SMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To identify the implications for mental health and medical services and&#xD;
      to obtain a better understanding of the contextual factors that affect the health problems&#xD;
      associated with HIV risk behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: The primary outcome variables are HIV seroprevalence, prevalence of HIV&#xD;
      risk behaviors including injection drug use and sexual promiscuity, personal and&#xD;
      social-contextual factors, comorbid mental disorders, and health service use among SMI&#xD;
      persons in each group, veterans versus non-veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Abstract: It is suspected, but not well documented, that persons with severe mental&#xD;
      illness represent a significant transmission source of serious infectious diseases. SMI&#xD;
      diagnoses are defined as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Severely mentally ill persons are at high risk for&#xD;
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS). To assess the&#xD;
      risk of HIV and related infections among these individuals, the National Institute of Mental&#xD;
      Health (NIMH) Office on AIDS funded the HIV/SMI five site collaborative study &quot;Assessing&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS and Associated Health Risks in People with Severe Mental Illness&quot;. This Durham ERIC&#xD;
      study supplements the NIMH HIV/SMI study with a four-year longitudinal cohort study of&#xD;
      300-plus SMI veterans in order to estimate the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and HIV&#xD;
      infection, as well as to measure utilization of health services over time. The Durham VA is&#xD;
      the only VA site represented in the study and is collaborating with four non-VA sites&#xD;
      including Dartmouth, University of New Hampshire, University of Connecticut and Duke&#xD;
      University. As such, we have the additional goals of investigating health and&#xD;
      health-care-service issues relevant to veterans with SMI and of establishing a database for&#xD;
      the longitudinal study of veterans with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation consisted of a one-hour structured HIV-risk behavior interview and a&#xD;
      blood and urine sample. These samples are being tested for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and C,&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus, gonorrhea, and chlamydia at the Durham VA Microbiology Laboratory. Subject&#xD;
      enrollment for this study concluded 6/30/2000 with 399 total subjects enrolled. Of these 399&#xD;
      enrolled, 111 subjects were re-tested and re-interviewed. The percentage of subjects enrolled&#xD;
      at the Durham VAMC with infectious diseases is as follows: 2.6% with HIV infection; 21% with&#xD;
      Hepatitis B core antibodies; and, 18% with Hepatitis C antibodies. Clinical management of&#xD;
      subjects with positive serology continues to be administered according to the procedures&#xD;
      developed by Richard Frothingham, M.D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Results: The initial manuscript for the study was published in American Journal of&#xD;
      Public Health in January, 2001 and analyses for additional publications are underway. Final&#xD;
      Report to be submitted to Durham ERIC within 90 days of study end date (3/31/02).&#xD;
