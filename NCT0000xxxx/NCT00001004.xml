  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the tolerance and toxicity of the combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and&#xD;
      interferon gamma (IFN-G) or as single agent TNF or IFN-G in HIV infected patients. To&#xD;
      selectively monitor the immune system of AIDS related complex (ARC) patients who receive&#xD;
      either combination therapy or TNF or IFN-G alone. To obtain information on the effectiveness&#xD;
      of combination therapy or TNF or IFN-G alone against HIV in ARC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant TNF and recombinant IFN-G have been shown to be effective against the virus which&#xD;
      causes AIDS and ARC in some laboratory studies, but may increase virus replication in other&#xD;
      laboratory studies. Previous studies in humans showed no increase in virus cultures and some&#xD;
      decrease in measurements of virus. Extensive preclinical data show that TNF and IFN-G are&#xD;
      more effective together than separately in laboratory and animal studies. As single agents,&#xD;
      both TNF and IFN-G have modest effect against HIV. Studies have demonstrated that TNF and&#xD;
      IFN-G, in combination, can not only inhibit HIV infection of previously uninfected cells, but&#xD;
      also can selectively induce the destruction of acutely infected target cells.&#xD;

      also can selectively induce the destruction of acutely infected target cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ARC who are positive for HIV antibody are randomized to receive one of three&#xD;
      treatment arms: (1) TNF alone by intramuscular injection (IM); (2) IFN-G alone by IM; (3) TNF&#xD;
      plus IFN-G. Patients receive IM injections 3 times weekly for 4 months (16 weeks). Repeated&#xD;
      physical examinations and laboratory tests are used to monitor patients' safety. Serial HIV&#xD;
      cultures and core antigen assays are employed to obtain evidence of antiviral activity and&#xD;
      serial T cell and skin tests are used to measure immunologic effect.&#xD;
