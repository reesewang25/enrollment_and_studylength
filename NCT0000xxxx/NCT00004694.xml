      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 3 way crossover&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients complete diary cards for the first month of the study in order to determine&#xD;
      compliance in providing a daily record of symptoms and medication taken. All compliant&#xD;
      patients receive subcutaneously injected heparin twice daily, inhaled heparin daily, or&#xD;
      matched saline placebo in a random order. Each of the three drug administration periods lasts&#xD;
      2 months, for a total of 6 months of treatment. Patients who have a flare in disease activity&#xD;
      that requires hospitalization are terminated from that drug administration period of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed biweekly during the first month and again at the end of the second&#xD;
      month for each of the three 2 month drug administration periods.&#xD;

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Disease Characteristics--&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (HAE) based upon C4 antigenic level,&#xD;
             positive family history, and C1 inhibitor (C1INH) antigenic level (Type I HAE) or&#xD;
             functional level (Type II HAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Functional C1 within normal levels if diagnosis of acquired C1INH is possible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative family history will not exclude as long as patient meets all other criteria,&#xD;
             has normal C1 level, and has no evidence of acquired C1INH deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of symptoms of HAE including episodic swelling, abdominal pain, and/or&#xD;
             respiratory difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--&#xD;

             at least 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other: No concurrent and at least 1 week since prior aspirin, nonsteroidal&#xD;
             antiinflammatory agents, dipyridamole, Coumadin-like drugs, or any other medication&#xD;
             having an effect on coagulation or platelets&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular: No clinically significant history of cardiac disease or hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary: No clinically significant history of pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other: No contraindication to the use of inhaled or subcutaneous heparin No drug&#xD;
