  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the brain's activity and&#xD;
      organization in the development of speech disorders. It will compare brain activity in people&#xD;
      with normal speech development with those who stutter or who have a phonological disorder (a&#xD;
      deficit in how the brain processes speech sounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stuttering and phonological disorders emerge during the critical period of speech development&#xD;
      between 2.5 and 12 years of age. During this period, the brain is much more adaptable for&#xD;
      speech development than it is after puberty. This study will examine how the brain&#xD;
      organization for speech production and perception develops normally during the critical&#xD;
      period and how the normal pattern is altered when stuttering and phonological disorders&#xD;
      become chronic problems, persisting throughout life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteer adults and children with and without speech disorders may participate in this&#xD;
      study. Eligibility screening will include a brief neurological and physical examination and&#xD;
      tests to determine normal speech or a speech disorder. The speech testing will be videotaped.&#xD;
      The subject will speak aloud, describe pictures, recall words or numbers, imitate speech&#xD;
      sounds and words, and perform some listening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study brain activity. For&#xD;
      this procedure, the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into a donut-shaped machine&#xD;
      with a strong magnetic field. During the MRI scan, the subject will perform simple tasks,&#xD;
      such as listening to speech or other sounds and saying nonsense words. The procedure should&#xD;
      take less than 60 minutes, and usually takes from 20 to 40 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of two developmental speech production disorders, which emerge during the&#xD;
      critical period of speech development between 2.5 and 12 years of age. During this critical&#xD;
      period there is considerably greater brain plasticity for speech functioning which disappears&#xD;
      following puberty. Our purpose is to determine how normal brain organization for speech&#xD;
      production and perception develops during the critical period and how this normal pattern is&#xD;
      altered when stuttering and phonological disorders become chronic problems, persisting&#xD;
      throughout the life span. Functional MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are non-invasive&#xD;
      methodologies suitable for research in these disorders in children. New methodologies using&#xD;
      fMRI and MEG provide the first opportunity for the study of speech production both in&#xD;
      normally developing children as well as children and adults with stuttering and/or&#xD;
      phonological disorders. Our hypothesis is that, with development, the brain organization for&#xD;
      speech production becomes less distributed involving fewer brain regions, and that&#xD;
      phonological processing mechanisms become lateralized to the left hemisphere during the&#xD;
      critical period of speech development. This research will address whether the brain regions&#xD;
      involved in speech are more diffuse and less selective in persons who develop chronic&#xD;
      stuttering and phonological disorders, leading to a less efficient dynamic system for speech&#xD;
      production.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To address the 15 hypotheses formulated for this research, several subject groups will be&#xD;
        studied. The functional activation patterns of normal right-handed adults will be compared&#xD;
        with normally developing right-handed children and adolescents (ages 6-17) during tasks&#xD;
        involving speech segmentation (into phonemes) and speech formulation. All will be native&#xD;
        speakers of American English without foreign language use in the home. Corresponding&#xD;
        subject groups will be adults and children with stuttering or phonological processing&#xD;
        disorders who are right-handed native speakers of American English. Our aim will be to&#xD;
        determine how brain function for speech perception and production change during completion&#xD;
        of the critical period for speech development and how these systems differ in children with&#xD;
        disorders of speech control and phonology who continue to have problems during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be excluded if he/she has a contraindication to MR scanning such as the&#xD;
        following: aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted cardiac pacemaker or&#xD;
        autodefibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular implant or foreign body (e.g. metal shavings or&#xD;
        splinters); insulin pump; shrapnel, bullet or shot wound; artificial heart valve; tattooed&#xD;
        makeup; prostheses of ferromagnetic material; surgical metal clips in the brain, eye or on&#xD;
        blood vessels; implanted drug infusion device. The LSS otolaryngologist, Pamela Kearney,&#xD;
        M.D., or LSS nurse practitioner Patti Henshel, C.R.N.P., will screen participants with the&#xD;
        NMR Center Safety Screening Questionnaire, which also includes additional items such as&#xD;
        intraventricular shunts, transdermal medication patches, wire sutures, bone/joint pins,&#xD;
        screws, nails, plates, and body piercings. Dr. Kearney or Ms. Henshel will approve or&#xD;
        disapprove participation in the study based on her judgement of the MR compatibility of&#xD;
        these items, using published guides including Shellock &amp; Kanal (1994) and Shellock (2001).&#xD;
        Other exclusion criteria are claustrophobia, pregnancy (as determined by pregnancy testing&#xD;
        at NIH's Clinical Center on the day of scanning); aphasia or dysarthria, language and/or&#xD;
        cognitive functioning lower than 2 standard deviations below the age-adjusted mean value on&#xD;
        screening tests, speech reception thresholds greater than dB; non-native American English&#xD;
        speech development; developmental exposure to a language other than English in the home,&#xD;
        and medications that affect central nervous system function at time of fMRI scanning. If a&#xD;
        potential participant elects to withdraw from medications, this must be done under the care&#xD;
        of the participant's own physician prior to participation in this protocol. Medication&#xD;
        withdrawal is not part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria for developmental stuttering only include: language and/or&#xD;
        cognitive functioning lower than 1 standard deviation below the age-adjusted mean value on&#xD;
        screening tests, left-handedness on the Edinburgh handedness questionnaire; movement&#xD;
        disorders (e.g., Huntington disease, chorea, myoclonus, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome,&#xD;
        Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and neuroleptic-induced syndromes),&#xD;
        brain tumors, history of traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness, genetic&#xD;
        diseases of the CNS (e.g., chromosomal diseases, metabolic disorders, diffuse sclerosis),&#xD;
        chronic infections of the nervous system (e.g., bacterial, vial, parasitic, fungal and&#xD;
        yeast), ataxias (inherited and acquired), myopathies (e.g., progressive muscular&#xD;
        dystrophies, familial periodic paralysis, congenital disorders of muscle, myoglobinuria,&#xD;
        polymyositis), disorders of the neuromuscular junction (e.g., myasthenia gravis),&#xD;
        demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, central pontine myelinolysis), other&#xD;
        brain abnormalities, schizophrenia, alcoholism, long-lasting drug dependence, major and/or&#xD;
        bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, vocal fold paralysis or paresis, joint&#xD;
        abnormality, or neoplasm, and history of swallowing disorders, airway obstruction.&#xD;
