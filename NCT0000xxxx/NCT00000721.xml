  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the maximal safe daily dose of BG8962 (rCD4) which can be administered by&#xD;
      continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) over 24 hours; to determine the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      BG8962 when it is administered by intramuscular and subcutaneous routes; and to look for dose&#xD;
      related antiviral activity determined by quantitation of infectious HIV peripheral blood&#xD;
      leukocytes (PBLs) and plasma, and by monitoring the blood levels of viral p24 antigen (when&#xD;
      present), CD4+ T-cells, and Beta-2- microglobulin. Recombinant soluble CD4 protein (rCD4) is&#xD;
      a drug that has been produced by genetic engineering techniques. In laboratory studies, rCD4&#xD;
      binds to HIV and reduces its ability to enter the cell, thus inhibiting its reproduction.&#xD;
      Before rCD4 can be tested for therapeutic effectiveness in HIV-infected patients, it is&#xD;
      necessary to determine the maximum dose that can be tolerated by humans. AMENDED: To date,&#xD;
      Biogen's original sequence recombinant soluble CD4 and Biogen's natural sequence recombinant&#xD;
      soluble CD4 have both been referred to as recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4). In order to&#xD;
      distinguish between these two products, a change in nomenclature has been made. In this&#xD;
      protocol, whenever the original sequence CD4 molecule is referred to, it is called&#xD;
      recombinant soluble T4 (rsT4). Whenever the natural sequence molecule (currently under study&#xD;
      in this protocol) is referred to, it is called BG8962 or rCD4. Whenever the drug is discussed&#xD;
      generically, it is referred to as rsCD4.&#xD;

      Recombinant soluble CD4 protein (rCD4) is a drug that has been produced by genetic&#xD;

      rCD4. Whenever the drug is discussed generically, it is referred to as rsCD4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose level is the highest dose previously established with other patients in this&#xD;
      trial to be safe when administered intramuscularly (IM). Dose escalation is by&#xD;
      semilogarithmic steps. A shift from IM injection to continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI)&#xD;
      is necessitated by the volume of drug which is administered as part of the escalation dose.&#xD;
      Three groups of eight patients each are treated as follows. The first group of 8 patients&#xD;
      receives BG8962 daily and consists of two cohorts of four patients each. One cohort receives&#xD;
      BG8962 as an IM injection. The second cohort receives BG8962 as a continuous 24 hour&#xD;
      infusion. All patients in this group are treated for 12 weeks. The second dosing group of 8&#xD;
      patients receive daily BG8962 by CSCI for 12 weeks. The third group of 8 patients receive&#xD;
      BG8962 by CSCI for 6 weeks. Every two weeks during the study the following tests and&#xD;
      evaluations are done: Blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis with microscopic exam, and&#xD;
      T-cells and T-cell subsets.&#xD;
