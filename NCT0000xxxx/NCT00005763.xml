      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades diet, particularly high habitual sodium intake, has been implicated in the&#xD;
      etiopathogenesis of high blood pressure. This concept has been based on clinical&#xD;
      observations, including therapeutics and results of dietary trials; on animal&#xD;
      experimentation, particularly induction of hypertension by salt feeding; and on epidemiologic&#xD;
      findings. While considerable knowledge has been amassed in support of this concept,&#xD;
      limitations and inconsistencies exist in the data base. This is especially true in regard to&#xD;
      the findings from population studies. Thus, negative or inconsistent results have been&#xD;
      reported from several cross-sectional studies of dietary sodium and blood pressure in which&#xD;
      the unit of measurement has been the individual within a population. When INTERSALT began in&#xD;
      1984, no prospective data were available from population-based longitudinal investigations. A&#xD;
      major problem in such studies, one possibly accounting for the negative and inconsistent&#xD;
      findings, was the difficulty of validly measuring the habitual sodium intake of individuals&#xD;
      within a population in which there was relative homogeneity in regard to this trait. This&#xD;
      difficulty was due to large individual variation day-to-day in the sodium intake and output&#xD;
      in most populations, so that the ratio of intra- to inter-individual variances was large.&#xD;
      This led to high probability of misclassification and obscuring or weakening of true&#xD;
      associations in any single population sample, unless multiple measurements were made for each&#xD;
      person. Since dietary history methods such as 7-day food records, multiple 24-hour recalls,&#xD;
      and dietary interviews were of limited validity for assessment of sodium intake,&#xD;
      investigators had to rely on timed urine collections, especially 24-hour samples. But&#xD;
      accurate collection of several such specimens per person by many individuals for population&#xD;
      studies was a difficult undertaking. This was an important reason for the paucity of valid&#xD;
      data on sodium and blood pressure from within-population studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERSALT was based on a common protocol and had a staff trained in standardized procedures&#xD;
      in each center, thus permitting estimation of the sodium-blood pressure relationship within&#xD;
      as well as across centers. INTERSALT originated as a Project of the Council on Epidemiology&#xD;
      and Prevention of the International Society and Federation of Cardiology and has since its&#xD;
      inception been jointly coordinated by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and&#xD;
      the Northwestern University Medical School. The main data analyses were performed in London.&#xD;
      Overwhelmingly, funding for the work of the London Coordinating Center, the Central&#xD;
      Laboratory, as well as for the 52 centers, had been organized independently. For example,&#xD;
      support came from the Wellcome Trust, the World Health Organization, the International&#xD;
      Society of Hypertension, the Council on Epidemiology and Prevention of the International&#xD;
      Society and Federation of Cardiology, the Dutch Heart Foundation, the British Heart&#xD;
      Foundation, the Canadian Heart Foundation, the Japanese Heart Foundation, as well as the&#xD;
      private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grant to Northwestern University supported the Chicago share of training and coordination&#xD;
      of the Chicago population sample of the Peoples Gas Company, assistance to six centers in&#xD;
      developing countries, part of the Coordinating Center and the Central Laboratory, and some of&#xD;
      the data analysis. The grant to the University of Mississippi supported the four population&#xD;
      samples in Mississippi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common protocol was followed in this cross-sectional study. Data were collected on blood&#xD;
      pressure and on electrolyte and creatinine excretion in timed 24-hour urine and casual urine&#xD;
      samples. Data were also collected on age, sex, height, weight, alcohol intake, diet, drug&#xD;
      treatment for hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease, contraceptive pill use,&#xD;
      smoking, physical activity, and social and educational status. Urine specimens were analyzed&#xD;
      for sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and creatinine in the central laboratory&#xD;
      at St. Raphael University in Leuven, Belgium. The data were coordinated at the London School&#xD;
      of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, England. The data from the University of&#xD;
      Mississippi were analyzed separately using uric acid as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 1992 to conduct further analysis. Based on the important findings of&#xD;
      an inverse association between urinary markers of protein intake and blood pressure in&#xD;
      analyses conducted on 12 of the 52 INTERSALT centers, the first component of the renewal&#xD;
      study was to complete the biochemical and statistical analyses for the 52 centers and provide&#xD;
      the first large population-based assessment to test the hypothesis of an inverse relationship&#xD;
      of dietary protein to BP of individuals (with N=10,079). This relationship was also examined&#xD;
      across populations having a wide variety of nutritional patterns (N = 52). The second major&#xD;
      component of the study renewal was to assess the impact protein intake had on the original&#xD;
      INTERSALT findings of a significant relation of Na, K, and Na/K with blood pressure. This&#xD;
      component included investigation of possible interactions of Na, K, and Na/K with protein as&#xD;
      well as with other factors shown in INTERSALT to relate to blood pressure. In addition to&#xD;
      these main substantive questions, methodologic issues related to assessment of nutritional&#xD;
      factors and blood pressure were further investigated.&#xD;
