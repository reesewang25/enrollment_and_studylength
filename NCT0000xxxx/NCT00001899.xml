      This study will examine the effects of increases in HIV blood levels on the immune system. A&#xD;
      better understanding of how HIV alters the immune response may lead to development of&#xD;
      effective immune-based therapies against the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with HIV-1 infection who have been receiving highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be eligible for this study. In order to study the effect&#xD;
      of increased levels of virus on the immune system, therapy will be stopped in these patients&#xD;
      temporarily. Therefore, only patients who have an appropriate level of understanding of the&#xD;
      potential benefits of therapy and the risks of stopping treatment will be considered for&#xD;
      enrollment. Pregnant women may not participate and women of childbearing potential must agree&#xD;
      not to become pregnant during the study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical exam, blood and urine tests and possibly a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, participants will have blood tests to measure the amount of virus in&#xD;
      the blood, CD4+ T cell counts, side effects of the medications, and how the patient s immune&#xD;
      system responds to HIV in the test tube. White cells will be collected through leukapheresis.&#xD;
      In this procedure, a needle is placed in an arm vein and blood flows from the vein through a&#xD;
      tube (catheter) into a cell separator machine, where the white cells are separated from the&#xD;
      rest of the blood by a spinning process. Some of the white cells are collected by the&#xD;
      machine, and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through a second needle placed in&#xD;
      the other arm. Patients will then have a physical examination and blood tests every 1 to 2&#xD;
      weeks and will be managed according to their viral load and CD4 cell counts as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral Load&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If viral blood levels remain less than 5000 copies per milliliter, no medical&#xD;
           intervention is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If viral blood levels rise to 5,000 copies per ml or higher, patients will undergo a&#xD;
           second leukapheresis and re-start antiretroviral therapy. They will be monitored at&#xD;
           least monthly until viral load returns to pre-study levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD4 Count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the CD4 count rises or remains at pre-study levels, no intervention is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the CD4 count decreases by 10 to 25 percent of pre-study levels, the counts will be&#xD;
           monitored every 2 weeks at least 3 times and then monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the CD4 count decreases by 25 percent or more of pre-study values, antiretroviral&#xD;
           therapy will be re-started and counts will be monitored until they return to pre-study&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If viral and CD4 levels do not return to pre-study levels promptly, patients will continue to&#xD;
      be monitored and will be advised about possible treatment changes. Alternatively, patients&#xD;
      whose viral and CD4 levels are similar to or better than pre-study values may be offered&#xD;
      laboratory testing every 3 months for at least 1 year if there is a scientific reason to&#xD;
      continue studying the patient s immune system. Patients may be asked to undergo additional&#xD;
      leukapheresis in the future, or another interruption of therapy in the future if it is felt&#xD;
      safe to do so.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in controlling HIV levels in&#xD;
      infected patients, but it is not effective in eliminating the virus from the patient and&#xD;
      life-long therapy is thought to be required. However, proper adherence to HAART regimens is&#xD;
      costly, results in inconveniences to patients, and is not without significant acute and&#xD;
      long-term risks. Many patients are interested in undergoing treatment interruption to relieve&#xD;
      these inconveniences and risks. This study seeks to identify these patients and to monitor&#xD;
      them for virologic and immunologic parameters during the treatment interruption. Patients&#xD;
      that meet the criteria for the study will discontinue all antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      simultaneously, after which the patient will be monitored by a full panel of virologic,&#xD;
      immunologic, and safety parameters. Through this study, we will attempt to further&#xD;
      characterize the mechanisms by which HIV evades and/or suppresses an effective anti-viral&#xD;
      immune response and to identify features of the virus or the patients' immune responses that&#xD;
      are associated with virologic control following treatment interruption.&#xD;

        HAART as well as the risks of discontinuing such treatment. The patient has a private&#xD;
        physician and the decision to interrupt antiretroviral therapy, the target point (i.e.&#xD;
        viral load or CD4+ T cell count) to reinitiate therapy, and the regiment of antiretrovirals&#xD;
        used upon re-initiation of therapy will be made with this private physician.&#xD;

        consisting of at least two nucleoside analogs and one protease inhibitor or two nucleoside&#xD;
        analogs and one NNRTI or three nucleosides in place of other drug classes OR patients that&#xD;
        are currently off therapy who are planning on resuming or initiating a HAART regimen within&#xD;
        the next 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
