      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary findings already have shown that, in contrast to women with low scores on the&#xD;
      Cook and Medley Hostility (Ho) scale, women with high Ho scores exhibit greater&#xD;
      cardiovascular changes to harassment. Additional findings have suggested that oral&#xD;
      contraceptive (0C) use may also be associated with increased behaviorally-induced&#xD;
      physiological changes, especially in low Ho women. Similarly, higher levels of total serum&#xD;
      cholesterol (TSC) have been positively associated with greater stress-induced neurohormonal&#xD;
      changes in middle-aged men with high Ho scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of autonomic activity took place in the laboratory and during a 24 hour ambulatory&#xD;
      measurement period. Hostility was measured with the Cook and Medley Hostility scale. The&#xD;
      laboratory assessment helped to determine if high hostility women responded to harassment&#xD;
      with greater cardiovascular and neurohormonal changes than low hostility women, and if this&#xD;
      relationship was altered by 0C use, lipids, and age. The ambulatory assessment of autonomic&#xD;
      activity allowed an exploration of the responses of high and low hostility subjects to&#xD;
      daily-life stressors. Several hypothesis were explored: 1) Did harassment produce&#xD;
      neuroendocrine as well as cardiovascular hyperreactivity in young women, and did this&#xD;
      hyperreactivity generalize from laboratory to real-life? 2) Were the harassment-induced&#xD;
      cardiovascular and neuroendocrine changes in young women also present in middle-aged women?&#xD;
      3) To what extent did 0C use modulate the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to&#xD;
      harassment in young women, and was 0C use also altering the hostility--related associations&#xD;
      between lipids and reactivity? 4) Were the differential lipid-reactivity associations&#xD;
      observed in middle-aged men as a function of high and low hostility scores present in women,&#xD;
      and, if so, were they modulated by age?&#xD;
