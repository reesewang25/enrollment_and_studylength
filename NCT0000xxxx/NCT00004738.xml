  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the genetic factors related to the Chiari I&#xD;
      malformation. In people with this abnormality, the lower part of the skull is smaller than&#xD;
      normal. As a result, the lowest part of the brain, called the cerebellar tonsils, protrudes&#xD;
      out of the hole at the bottom of the skull into the spinal canal. This study will try to&#xD;
      discover the location of the genes responsible for the malformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates for this study are: 1) Patients with Chiari I malformation who also have a family&#xD;
      member with the abnormality or a family member with syringomyelia (a cyst in the spinal cord&#xD;
      that is often associated with the Chiari I malformation). 2) Family members of patients with&#xD;
      the Chiari I malformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical and neurologic examinations. They will&#xD;
      undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical (neck) spinal cord to&#xD;
      measure the size of the head and determine the presence of the Chiari I malformation and&#xD;
      syringomyelia. A small blood sample (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for DNA studies&#xD;
      relating to the Chiari I malformation.&#xD;

      Objectives: The goal of this study is to establish family pedigrees and undertake genetic&#xD;
      linkage analysis that will identify gene loci associated with the Chiari I malformation and&#xD;
      underdevelopment of the bone forming the posterior cranial fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients and family members of patients with the Chiari I malformation.&#xD;
      Because the research institutions are located in the United States and Russia, subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited predominantly from these countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Human subjects will undergo 1) neurologic examinations, 2) head and cervical MRI&#xD;
      scans to evaluate for the Chiari I malformation, syringomyelia, and maldevelopment of the&#xD;
      posterior fossa, and 3) isolation and analysis of genomic DNA from whole blood for linkage&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Pedigrees will be established based on the MRI findings. The Chiari I&#xD;
      phenotype will be defined as the caudal portion of the cerebellar tonsils lying greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 2 mm below the foramen magnum and underdevelopment of the bone of the posterior&#xD;
      fossa will be defined as 1) obliteration of the CSF pathways in the inferior portion of the&#xD;
      posterior fossa, 2) posterior fossa volume to supratentorial volume ratio of less than or&#xD;
      equal to 15%, or 3) abnormal shortening of the bones of the skull base. Genetic analysis of&#xD;
      the genomic DNA will be performed with DNA polymorphic markers to identify chromosomal loci&#xD;
      linked to the small posterior fossa phenotype. A lod score of 3.0 (equivalent to 1000:1 odds&#xD;
      in favor of linkage) will be taken as proof that the Chiari I gene maps to the same genetic&#xD;
      region of the human genome as a given DNA marker.&#xD;
