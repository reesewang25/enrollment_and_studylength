  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and usefulness of zidovudine (AZT) for the treatment of children 3&#xD;
      months to 12 years of age. This study is designed to determine if children who are infected&#xD;
      with HIV and who have a special type of lung disease called lymphocytic interstitial&#xD;
      pneumonitis (LIP) or other early symptoms of HIV infection may derive benefit from treatment&#xD;
      with AZT. It is hoped that this drug will prevent children from developing additional&#xD;
      symptoms and infections and will help resolve already existing symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZT has been shown in the laboratory to inhibit the infection of cells by HIV. AZT has been&#xD;
      shown to decrease the mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in certain&#xD;
      adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. It is, therefore, likely that symptomatic&#xD;
      HIV-infected children may also benefit from specific antiviral therapy.&#xD;

      AZT has been shown in the laboratory to inhibit the infection of cells by HIV. AZT has been&#xD;
      shown to decrease the mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in certain&#xD;
      adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. It is, therefore, likely that symptomatic&#xD;
      HIV-infected children may also benefit from specific antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who participate in the study are evaluated at a hospital outpatient clinic and are&#xD;
      under the care of a specialist in pediatrics. Of the children who participate in the study,&#xD;
      half receive AZT syrup and half receive a placebo (sugar solution). The investigator does not&#xD;
      know which medication each child receives as this is decided by a random process. The&#xD;
      children take the medication in a strawberry-flavored clear syrup every 6 hours (4 times a&#xD;
      day), for a period of 2 years or 104 weeks. The children are monitored on an outpatient basis&#xD;
      while receiving therapy and the tests performed on admission to the study are repeated&#xD;
      several times during treatment. Blood samples are obtained once a week for the first 4 weeks,&#xD;
      every other week for the next 4 weeks, and then monthly until the end of the study. At&#xD;
      certain sites, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected by lumbar puncture every 52 weeks to&#xD;
      evaluate infection involving the brain and nervous system. An independent committee reviews&#xD;
      the data collected on the children every 6 months. The drug is stopped or the dose reduced if&#xD;
      unacceptable side effects develop. AMENDED: As of August 7, 1989 the study blind was broken,&#xD;
      the placebo arm discontinued and the study closed to accrual as of September 25, 1989. The 6&#xD;
      children enrolled in the study have been offered AZT.&#xD;
