  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility and dose-limiting toxicity of administering escalating doses of dendritic&#xD;
      cells transfected with autologous renal cell carcinoma RNA DC(DCRCC-RNA) will be defined. As&#xD;
      a secondary endpoint, the ability of DCRCC-RNA to induce tumor-specific immune responses will&#xD;
      be evaluated. Finally, the anti-tumor effects measured by clinical response criteria, their&#xD;
      duration and overall survival (calculated at 2-year follow-up) will be determined in each&#xD;
      patient receiving dendritic cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Prognosis in metastatic renal cell carcinoma is poor with a median survival of&#xD;
      less than one year. Although renal cell carcinoma has shown some response to immunotherapy,&#xD;
      the results of systemic administration of biologic response modifiers in disseminated renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma have been poor. Growing evidence suggests that active immunotherapy,&#xD;
      particularly dendritic cells (DC) based vaccines, may prove to be a viable and clinically&#xD;
      effective therapeutic option for patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      Methods: This study will enroll patients with renal cell carcinoma Stage III (T3 N1 M0) or&#xD;
      Stage IV (T4 N0 N1 M0 - any T N2 M0 - any T any N M1) after nephrectomy. Peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells collected through leukapheresis are processed for DC generation.&#xD;
      Mononuclear cells are separated and cultured for 7 days in GM-CSF and IL-4. Harvested DC will&#xD;
      be pulsed with renal tumor RNA harvested during nephrectomy. An aliquot of these cells will&#xD;
      be tested for appropriate phenotype fungal and bacterial sterility as well as for endotoxin&#xD;
      content prior to lot release. Renal tumor RNA transfected DC will be stored cryopreserved&#xD;
      until administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 patients will be enrolled at a low dose and monitored for dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities. If no dose limiting toxicities are seen, the next 3 patients will be enrolled at&#xD;
      the medium dose. If no dose limiting toxicities are seen in the medium dose, 6 additional&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled on the high dose and will be evaluated for dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities. If in preparation of the vaccine insufficient RNA or dendritic cells are&#xD;
      available to perform the required three injections at the assigned dose level or if the&#xD;
      patient is withdrawn from the study the treatment position will remain open, i.e., no dose&#xD;
      fractions will be given. Patients in whom only the minimum number of DCRCC-RNA can be&#xD;
      produced to deliver one I.V. and one I.D. injection will be able to receive the vaccine, even&#xD;
      if he or she is assigned to a higher dose level, but will be replaced in order to assess&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis 1. To determine the short and long term toxicities associated with&#xD;
      administration of DCRCC-RNA in patients with metastatic RCC. 2. To determine feasibility of&#xD;
      DC vaccine generation according to the proportion of patients for whom sufficient cells are&#xD;
      generated to provide treatment. 3. To determine the cellular immune response to&#xD;
      administration of DCRCC-RNA. 4. To measure the clinical responses mediated by administration&#xD;
      of DCRCC-RNA.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic RCC following resection of the primary renal tumor&#xD;
             (Pathologic diagnosis and staging of the disease will be completed at time of&#xD;
             surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0 or 1 according the Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
             Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria and must have an estimated life expectancy of 6 months&#xD;
             and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have undergone any major surgery during the past 6 weeks. In&#xD;
             addition no chemotherapeutic agents, (standard or experimental) radiation therapy,&#xD;
             (local therapy or palliative treatment for painful bony metastases) or immunotherapy&#xD;
             (i.e. IL-2, interferon-alpha, ALT therapy) can be administered 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities from prior&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
