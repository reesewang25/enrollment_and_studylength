      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The African-American population of the United States continues to experience high rates of&#xD;
      mortality from cardiovascular (CV) disease, including coronary heart disease, stroke and&#xD;
      renal failure. The major syndromes which determine CV risk, including obesity,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, glucose intolerance, and hypertension, all occur more frequently among&#xD;
      African Americans. Nutritional factors underlie many forms of CV disease and are an important&#xD;
      focus of current prevention efforts. Very little is currently known, however, about specific&#xD;
      nutritional patterns among African Americans that might lead to CV risk, or the applicability&#xD;
      of structured interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in response to an initiative on &quot;Collaborative Projects on Minority&#xD;
      Health&quot; which was released in October 1992 after review and approval at the September 1992&#xD;
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the growing recognition of the importance of total fat, from the point of view of both&#xD;
      disease risk and eating patterns, the primary focus of the intervention was to reduce the&#xD;
      percentage of calories in the diet from fat. Four hundred households were recruited and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either an active intervention or observation group for a period of 18&#xD;
      months. Dietary change consistent with specific recommendations made to the American public&#xD;
      for reducing cardiovascular (CV) risk was encouraged, namely, reduction in total fat,&#xD;
      saturated fat (SFA), and cholesterol (Chol). A practical, community-based program was&#xD;
      developed which could be taken into households. Nutrition education and enhancement of skills&#xD;
      helpful in making behavioral change formed the basis of the intervention. Lay educators,&#xD;
      recruited from the target neighborhoods, worked under the close supervision of a community&#xD;
      nutritionist. Changes in reported dietary intake, serum lipids/lipoproteins and body weights&#xD;
      were measured. In addition to the formal evaluation of the trial outcome, an important&#xD;
      secondary goal was to obtain detailed information about eating patterns in this community and&#xD;
      characterize behavior associated with the achievement and maintenance of target nutrient&#xD;
      goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of a collaborative project on minority health. Dr. Prewitt collaborated&#xD;
      with Dr. Marian Fitzgibbon who was the principal investigator on R01HL51532.&#xD;
