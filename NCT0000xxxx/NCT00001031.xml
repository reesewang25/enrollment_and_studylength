      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of SF-2 rgp120 vaccine in MF59 versus MN rgp120&#xD;
      vaccine in alum in volunteers who are seronegative for HIV-1. AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: To&#xD;
      determine the ability of immunization with MN rgp120/HIV-1 in combination with alum or SF-2&#xD;
      rgp120 in combination with MF59 to induce an HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type&#xD;
      hypersensitivity (DTH) response in volunteers who receive rsgp120/MN skin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amino acid sequence of HIV-1 gp120 can vary as much as 40 percent from isolate to&#xD;
      isolate. Thus, the identification of an immunogen that can elicit broadly neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies to HIV-1 is a major challenge in AIDS vaccine development. Two candidate vaccines,&#xD;
      recombinant envelope subunit proteins from the SF-2 and MN isolates of HIV-1, have shown&#xD;
      immunogenicity and good tolerance in healthy immunocompetent adults. This study will expand&#xD;
      testing into a larger population base, particularly targeting individuals at high risk for&#xD;
      HIV infection.&#xD;

      The amino acid sequence of HIV-1 gp120 can vary as much as 40 percent from isolate to&#xD;
      isolate. Thus, the identification of an immunogen that can elicit broadly neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies to HIV-1 is a major challenge in AIDS vaccine development. Two candidate vaccines,&#xD;
      recombinant envelope subunit proteins from the SF-2 and MN isolates of HIV-1, have shown&#xD;
      immunogenicity and good tolerance in healthy immunocompetent adults. This study will expand&#xD;
      testing into a larger population base, particularly targeting individuals at high risk for&#xD;
      HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-seronegative volunteers (including four populations at higher risk for HIV infection and&#xD;
      two populations at lower risk) receive one of four regimens. Two treatment groups receive 50&#xD;
      mcg SF-2 rgp 120 (BIOCINE) in MF59 adjuvant or 600 mcg MN rgp120 (Genentech) in alum. Two&#xD;
      control groups receive vehicle (placebo) in MF59 adjuvant alone or alum adjuvant alone.&#xD;
      Immunizations are given at months 0, 1, and 6. AS PER AMENDMENT 10/93: patients enrolled by&#xD;
      June 15, 1993, receive a fourth immunization at month 12 or 18 (50 percent of patients for&#xD;
      each schedule). Patients are followed until 2 years after the first injection. AS PER&#xD;
      AMENDMENT 05/10/94: a special study of vaccine acceptability and HIV-related risk behavior&#xD;
      will be conducted at some time between months 12 and 18. AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: a special&#xD;
      DTH study will be conducted in consenting volunteers who have received three or four&#xD;
      immunizations. The injections will be given at the end of the study (on or after day 1, &amp;&#xD;
      56). Followup is extended to 56 days after administration of the intradermal injection.&#xD;
