      The Framingham Heart Study was initiated to study the factors associated with the development&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease by employing long-term surveillance of an adult population in&#xD;
      Framingham, Massachusetts. The Framingham Offspring Study was initiated to assess familial&#xD;
      and genetic factors as determinants of coronary heart disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Framingham Heart Study, initiated in 1948, was designed as a longitudinal investigation&#xD;
      of constitutional and environmental factors influencing the development of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease in men and women free of these conditions at the outset. The first person was&#xD;
      examined in September 1948 and four years later 5,209 persons had received their first&#xD;
      examination. The group has now been followed in the Study for twenty-four subsequent biennial&#xD;
      examinations. The need for more information arises from the fact that the epidemiology of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease is incompletely known, estimation of risk is imprecise, and the&#xD;
      pattern of cardiovascular disease incidence is changing; these changes need to be documented.&#xD;
      Changing patterns of cigarette smoking, nutritional habits and exercise patterns as well as&#xD;
      changes in other aspects of lifestyle and advances in medical care may all influence future&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rates for cardiovascular disease. New cases of clinically&#xD;
      recognizable cardiovascular disease are less predictable in disease free subjects over age&#xD;
      60, and an already large and growing proportion of the total cardiovascular disease events is&#xD;
      now first expressed at these ages. Recently available, technologically advanced measurement&#xD;
      tools such as echocardiography need to be evaluated as risk assessors in various age groups.&#xD;
      Similarly, the predictive efficacy of recently available lipoprotein cholesterol and&#xD;
      apoprotein measurements need to be demonstrated for early onset (age less than 60) as well as&#xD;
      later onset cardiovascular disease. Thus, as changes in early detection and treatment of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease advance, prospective epidemiology is needed to document the value and&#xD;
      impact of these changes in an organized fashion. Finally, the availability of prospective&#xD;
      data on two generations adds to the uniqueness of the Framingham Study among ongoing studies&#xD;
      of CVD epidemiology. A determination of the extent and mechanisms by which cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases cluster in families is another important goal of the Framingham Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1982, the National Institute on Aging initiated a study on senile dementia using the&#xD;
      Framingham Heart Study cohort. The study was designed to determine morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      outcomes among the 160 subjects identified as suffering from dementia at the 15th biennial&#xD;
      examination and to determine incidence of senile dementia among those subjects free of&#xD;
      dementia at the 15th biennial examination. Outcome of nursing home admissions was also&#xD;
      determined in all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biennial comprehensive examinations of the Framingham Heart Study cohort have taken place&#xD;
      since 1949. Until examination 12, the study was carried out entirely by the NHLBI. After that&#xD;
      time, the Boston University Medical Center, in collaboration with, and using facilities and&#xD;
      equipment made available by NHLBI, was responsible for the examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biennial examinations are conducted in the surviving original cohort to obtain information on&#xD;
      physical activity, blood pressure, diet, body weight, occupational history, psychosocial&#xD;
      factors, and personal habits such as smoking. Special tests include electrocardiographic&#xD;
      evaluation, exercise stress test, HLA typing, lipoprotein and apoprotein testing,&#xD;
      non-invasive assessment of atherosclerosis, fasting blood glucose, lung function testing,&#xD;
      B-scan/Doppler of the carotid and or femoral arteries, and clotting or hemostatic measures.&#xD;
      Endpoints include coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the Offspring Study were examined for the first time between 1971 and 1975, for&#xD;
      the second time between 1979 and 1983, for the third time between 1983 and 1987. Examinations&#xD;
      consist of a complete physical examination including resting electrocardiogram, medical&#xD;
      history, non-invasive cardiovascular examination, lung function assessment, lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol and apoprotein measurements, SMA 25, personal history interview, blood cell ion&#xD;
      flux measurement, and platelet function and blood clotting factors measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 27th exam of approximately 400 survivors of the original cohort is complete. The 28th&#xD;
      exam has begun and is ahead of schedule. The 7th exam of the Offspring Cohort began in&#xD;
      September 1998 and was completed in December 2001 with 3,500 participants examined. The&#xD;
      genome scan is complete with approximately 1,800 samples from 336 families. A Genetics&#xD;
      Advisory Panel meets regularly to advise NHLBI on the direction of genetic research within&#xD;
      the Framingham Study. Analysis of the genetic and nongenetic data is ongoing and extensive&#xD;
      covering such areas as the genetics of lipids, lifetime risk of coronary heart disease,&#xD;
      trends in events following Q-wave myocardial infarction, factors affecting left ventricular&#xD;
      hypertrophy, and the prevalence and determinants of heart valve disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of the Third Generation Study was announced in November 2001. Beginning in 2002,&#xD;
      the Third Generation Study enrolled 3,900 grandchildren of the Framingham Heart Study's&#xD;
      original enrollees. Key goals are to identify new risk factors for heart, lung, and blood&#xD;
      diseases, identify genes that contribute to good health and to the development of heart,&#xD;
      lung, and blood disease, and to develop new imaging tests that can detect very early stages&#xD;
      of coronary atherosclerosis in otherwise healthy adults.&#xD;
