  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black Americans tend to die more often from and have more diseases associated with heart&#xD;
      disease than White Americans. The exact cause of this is unknown, but it is likely a&#xD;
      combination of genetics, behavior, risk factors, strategies for education and prevention, and&#xD;
      socioeconomic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested that faster biological processes in blood vessels of Black&#xD;
      Americans may be the cause of increased amounts of heart disease. In addition, small blood&#xD;
      vessels in Black Americans seem to be less responsive to substances that relax blood vessels,&#xD;
      which may explain increased blood pressure levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers plan to study artery relaxation (dilation) in response substances&#xD;
      affecting the cells lining blood vessels (endothelin). Researchers will compare the results&#xD;
      of this study in black and white people to find out whether racial differences may contribute&#xD;
      to increases in heart disease and heart related deaths in blacks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Black Americans have a greater morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      compared to whites. The cause for this phenomenon is probably multifactorial and includes&#xD;
      differences in pathogenesis, risk factor patterns, genetic background, behavioral variables,&#xD;
      strategies for education and prevention, and socioeconomic factors. Recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      that acceleration of some of the processes related to vascular biology may account for the&#xD;
      greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease in blacks. A diminished vasodilator response of&#xD;
      the microvasculature has been shown in African Americans and may therefore be responsible for&#xD;
      their increased prevalence of hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction is a central mechanism in&#xD;
      the development of atherosclerosis. It is therefore reasonable to postulate that endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction of large conductance arteries may also contribute to a greater susceptibility to&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in blacks compared to whites, even in those individuals without the known&#xD;
      risk factors for coronary heart disease. In the present study, we propose to investigate&#xD;
      brachial artery dilation in response to endothelium-dependent and -independent stimuli in&#xD;
      black and white individuals to determine whether racial differences in the vascular biology&#xD;
      of large conductance vessels that might contribute to the greater cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality previously reported in blacks.&#xD;
