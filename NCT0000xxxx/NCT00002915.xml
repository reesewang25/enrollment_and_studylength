      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of penclomedine in treating patients who&#xD;
      have advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral penclomedine that can be&#xD;
      administered daily for 5 days every 4 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancies. II. Describe and quantitate the toxic effects of penclomedine administered on&#xD;
      this schedule in these patients. III. Study the clinical pharmacology and metabolism of&#xD;
      penclomedine on this schedule, and seek pharmacodynamic correlates of pharmacologic&#xD;
      parameters with clinical endpoints. IV. Study the bioavailability of oral penclomedine, and&#xD;
      qualitatively compare metabolite profiles produced following oral and intravenous&#xD;
      administration in these patients. V. Seek preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of&#xD;
      penclomedine in patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      penclomedine. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses until the MTD is&#xD;
      reached. Patients receive oral penclomedine for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. If tumor&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity is documented during any treatment course, the patient&#xD;
      is removed from study. A total of 10 patients will be treated at the dose determined to be&#xD;
      the MTD (the recommended phase II dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An estimated 20 patients will be accrued over approximately 10 months.&#xD;
