      To evaluate granulocyte transfusion therapy with respect to its prophylactic and therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness to prevent and aid recovery from infection. The study trials were conducted&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection remains a major cause of death in patients receiving chemotherapy for malignant&#xD;
      diseases. One approach to the problem of septicemia and high mortality in these patients was&#xD;
      the therapeutic use of granulocyte transfusions. Improvements in collection techniques,&#xD;
      employing continuous flow centrifugation, permitted the collection of granulocytes from a&#xD;
      single, normal donor in sufficient numbers to study their application in the treatment of&#xD;
      infections in granulocytopenic patients. Studies had demonstrated the efficacy of granulocyte&#xD;
      transfusions as an adjunct in the therapy of septicemia due to gram negative microorganisms&#xD;
      associated with granulocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study were to determine (1) whether infections could be prevented in patients&#xD;
      who received granulocytes prophylactically and (2) whether recovery from infection was aided&#xD;
      in patients who received granulocytes therapeutically. Both trials utilized controls who&#xD;
      received no granulocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four contracts were awarded in September 1976. The protocol designed to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions was completed at the close of 1977. The protocol for&#xD;
      the therapeutic trial was completed in April 1978. Approximately 90 patients were randomized&#xD;
      in the prophylactic trial and 51 in the therapeutic trial. The Recruitment and Intervention&#xD;
      Phase ended in February 1980. The trial has concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic Trial and Therapeutic Trial: randomized, non-blind, sequential. Eligible&#xD;
      patients were randomized to daily granulocyte transfusions or no granulocyte transfusions.&#xD;
