    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the&#xD;
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's&#xD;
      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine combined with docetaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin with or without filgrastim in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and docetaxel when&#xD;
      administered with carboplatin with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. II. Determine a safe dose level and schedule for this regimen for phase II&#xD;
      study in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel and gemcitabine. Patients receive&#xD;
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes, docetaxel IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      on day 1. Patients also receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for approximately 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and&#xD;
      docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT). If the DLT is grade 4 neutropenia, filgrastim (G-CSF) is added to the regimen&#xD;
      (administered subcutaneously on days 2-7 and 8-14 or until blood counts recover). A new MTD&#xD;
      is then determined. Patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
