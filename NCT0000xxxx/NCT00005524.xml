      To examine the vagal, vascular sympathetic, and mechno-structural components of baroreflex&#xD;
      regulation in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and healthy age-matched controls during&#xD;
      rest and acute laboratory stress.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strong association between mental stress and morbid cardiovascular events in coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD) patients may derive from stress-induced cardiac ischemia due to&#xD;
      exaggerated increases in vascular resistance and arterial pressure. In fact, this may explain&#xD;
      part of the prognostic relationship of baroreflex cardiac vagal control to cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcome among CAD patients. The hemodynamic responses to psychological stress are buffered by&#xD;
      the arterial baroreflex; thus, exaggerated pressor responses to mental stress may result from&#xD;
      impaired baroreflex regulation in CAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three components. The first component characterizes the relationships between&#xD;
      vascular stiffness and baroreflex regulation among CAD patients, also contrasting healthy&#xD;
      control subjects with CAD patients. The second component examines, in relation to individual&#xD;
      differences in pharmacologically derived estimates of baroreflex function, changes in&#xD;
      autonomic and baroreflex control during laboratory psychological stress among CAD patients&#xD;
      and among healthy control subjects. The third component tests the hypothesis that impaired&#xD;
      baroreflex regulation in CAD patients, due to increased vascular stiffness and/or attenuated&#xD;
      autonomic control, is associated with exacerbated hemodynamic reactions to psychological&#xD;
      stress. Bolus vasoactive drug infusions in combination with Finapres beat-by-beat arterial&#xD;
      pressures and carotid B-mode ultrasonography are used to evaluate baroreflex sensitivity and&#xD;
      arterial stiffness. Baroreflex adjustments to psychological stress are assessed by power&#xD;
      spectral-derived relations between arterial pressure and cardiac chronotropy during a mental&#xD;
      arithmetic task and a speech task. The degree to which indices of baroreflex function are&#xD;
      associated with hemodynamic responses to psychological stress among CAD patients is assessed.&#xD;
