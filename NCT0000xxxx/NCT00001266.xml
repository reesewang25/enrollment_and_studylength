  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One current hypothesis as to what limits duration of initial hormone response is the rapid&#xD;
      emergence of hormone resistant prostate carcinoma cells. Suramin has shown effectiveness as a&#xD;
      treatment for hormonally refractory prostate carcinoma. Survival was less in patients with&#xD;
      high rather than low circulating androgen levels. Thus, suramin might slow the emergence of&#xD;
      hormone refractory tumor cells while combined androgen ablation may maximize the&#xD;
      effectiveness of suramin. In this trial, we will pilot this concept.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential for combined androgen blockage&#xD;
      (Leuprolide and Flutamide), given with suramin (a growth factor inhibitor) to improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcome(s) in a cohort of patients with bulky metastatic prostate cancer. Combined&#xD;
      androgen blockage is currently the standard of care for such individuals. Suramin has shown&#xD;
      reproducible activity in individuals with androgen independent disease. Since these two&#xD;
      approaches are independent of one another - on the molecular level, and in clinical results -&#xD;
      it is hoped that the combination of these two approaches will result in improved response&#xD;
      rates and in improved survival.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate and must not have&#xD;
        had a trial of hormonal therapy or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be 18 years of age and an SGOT/SGPT within 2 times of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have stage D2 prostate carcinoma or State D1 disease with a Gleason grade 7&#xD;
        or above (poorly differentiated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No other malignancy except curatively treated basal cell cancer of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance status ECOG of 0-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of bleeding diathesis. Patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease will be&#xD;
        eligible if the ulcer is shown to be resolved by a barium study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of cerebrovascular event, either thrombotic or hemorrhagic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No current clinical signs of congestive heart failure, angina pectoris or myocardial&#xD;
        infarction. Patient cannot be on calcium channel blockers such as Nifedipine, Diltiazem, or&#xD;
        Verapamil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No clinical or radiographic evidence of brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with extensive liver replacement (greater than 50%) by tumor will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a creatinine lest than or equal 2.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance of&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 40 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate hepatic function (bilirubin less than 1.5mg%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the patient has white cells in his urinalysis or other evidence of a urinary tract&#xD;
        infection, this must be evaluated and appropriate therapy initiation prior to the&#xD;
        initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have received chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        An absolute granulocyte count greater than 1,500; platelet count greater than 100,000;&#xD;
        Fibrinogen greater than 200 mg/dl; Hgb greater than or equal to 9 gm/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Reliability of the patient to take oral medication, go home and return for follow-up and&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
