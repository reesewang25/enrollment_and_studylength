      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This protocol is concerned with the acquisition of blood, skin, or mucosal samples from&#xD;
      healthy volunteers or patients with selected skin diseases to support the basic science and&#xD;
      clinical research activities of the Dermatology Branch and other intramural Laboratories and&#xD;
      Branches at the NIH Clinical Research Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Primary)&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To allow collection of blood, skin, or mucosal samples from healthy volunteers or patients&#xD;
      with selected skin or systemic diseases as needed to support the research activities of our&#xD;
      Branch and other Laboratories and Branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy individuals (including employees and other patients) and patients with selected&#xD;
           skin or other diseases, including individuals of both genders and all racial/ethnic&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient volunteers must be willing to undergo blood drawing and/or skin/mucosal&#xD;
           biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This is dependent upon the particular investigation for which these samples are needed.&#xD;
