      To identify genes involved in the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease, including atrial&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1987, when the third renewal of the Ischemic Heart Disease Specialized Centers of Research&#xD;
      renewal was considered, the Cardiology Advisory Committee recommended that the scope of the&#xD;
      SCORs should be broadened to include peripheral vascular disease, congenital heart disease,&#xD;
      and heart failure. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council concurred in this&#xD;
      recommendation and the Request for Applications for a Specialized Centers of Research in&#xD;
      Coronary and Vascular Disease, Heart Failure and Congenital Heart Disease was issued in July&#xD;
      1987. The study was renewed in 1999 as P50HL62178.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in 1990, the molecular genetic epidemiology of endocardial cushion defects in four&#xD;
      groups of individuals was investigated in this subproject within a SCOR in Pediatric&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease. Subjects included those with Down syndrome and endocardial cushion&#xD;
      defects, those with non-syndromic endocardial cushion defects, those with Down syndrome and&#xD;
      no congenital heart disease, and those with normal hearts. Examinations were carried out in&#xD;
      the relatives of these subjects to ascertain whether they had endocardial cushion defects and&#xD;
      other chromosome 21-related disorders, such as Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. This&#xD;
      was accomplished by obtaining family pedigrees and examining 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree&#xD;
      relatives utilizing electrocardiographic and echocardiographic techniques. Venous blood was&#xD;
      obtained from the probands and the relatives for association studies with DNA probes that&#xD;
      were known to relate to chromosome 21 and to genes located on other chromosomes that may&#xD;
      affect cardiac embryogenesis. Segregation analysis focused on families of the subjects with&#xD;
      non-syndromic endocardial cushion defects to determine whether there was evidence for a major&#xD;
      gene defect which resulted in deformities of the atrioventricular canal. If and when such&#xD;
      evidence was found, linkage studies were carried out in an attempt to pinpoint the location&#xD;
      of the major gene in the genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the SCOR was renewed in 1995, the objectives were to identify polymorphisms in candidate&#xD;
      genes and to use the polymorphisms for genetic association studies in patients. Subjects&#xD;
      included those with Down syndrome and atrioventricular canal defects, non-Down subjects with&#xD;
      atrioventricular canal defects, Down syndrome subjects with no functional heart disease,&#xD;
      normal subjects with no heart disease or Down syndrome, Down syndrome subjects with&#xD;
      perimembranous interventricular septal defects, and non-Down subjects with perimembranous&#xD;
      interventricular septal defects. In addition, polymorphisms within candidate genes, as well&#xD;
      as the highly polymorphic short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs), were used in a&#xD;
      genome-wide linkage search for the gene in large families with multiple affected individuals.&#xD;
      When association or linkage studies suggested involvement of a specific gene, a search for&#xD;
      mutations in the gene was carried out. In addition, the investigators determined whether a&#xD;
      likely candidate chromosomal region (chromosome 21q21.1-qter) was involved in non-Downs AVCD&#xD;
      by using molecular techniques to search for allele loss, uniparental disomy, and cryptic&#xD;
      translocations. They also investigated the molecular genetic variability associated with&#xD;
      endocardial cushion and ventricular septal development in Down syndrome subjects with and&#xD;
      without heart disease and in normal subjects. Examinations were carried out in the relatives&#xD;
      of these subjects to ascertain whether they had congenital heart defects or any other&#xD;
      congenital anomalies. This was accomplished by obtaining family pedigrees, medical histories,&#xD;
      and examining 1st degree relatives (and, if positive, 2nd and 3rd degree relatives) utilizing&#xD;
      echocardiographic and electrocardiographic techniques.&#xD;
