  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is one of the most common of all symptoms. It is also a great cause of days lost&#xD;
      from work and visits to health care providers. This study will develop and evaluate an&#xD;
      approach to low back pain that allows subjects to talk with each other and with health&#xD;
      professionals via an Internet discussion group. Results we will look at include health&#xD;
      behaviors, such as exercise; health status, such as pain and disability; and health care use,&#xD;
      such as number of visits to doctors and other health care providers. Anyone 18 years old or&#xD;
      older who lives in the United States and has ongoing Internet access can take part in the&#xD;
      study. All subjects must have back pain and meet the eligibility criteria listed below.&#xD;

      This study will develop and evaluate in a randomized trial a low back pain intervention that&#xD;
      allows subjects to talk with each other and with health professionals via an Internet&#xD;
      discussion group. The intervention consists of a book and a videotape and is based on&#xD;
      interaction with other participants in the program and health professionals through a closed&#xD;
      password protected moderated Internet discussion group. Outcome measures include health&#xD;
      behaviors, such as exercise; health status, such as pain and disability; and health care use,&#xD;
      such as number of visits to doctors and other health care providers. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized either to the treatment group and followed for 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
