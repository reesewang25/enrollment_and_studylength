    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the brain allows people to focus on&#xD;
      important objects and filter out unimportant ones when looking at visual images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our senses provide us with a vast amount of information at any given moment in time. For&#xD;
      example, visual scenes contain many different objects that cannot be processed simultaneously&#xD;
      because of the limited processing capacity of the brain's visual system. Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that a a network of brain regions selects relevant information and filters out irrelevant&#xD;
      information when people view cluttered visual scenes. This study will use transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine how&#xD;
      the different brain regions involved in attentional control and filtering interact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undergo computer tests, an MRI scan, and TMS. During the MRI,&#xD;
      participants will look at pictures and count objects appearing on a screen. During the TMS,&#xD;
      participants will perform a computer test. Participants' ability to pay attention will be&#xD;
      tested with and without TMS. Participants may be asked to return for additional tests in the&#xD;
      future....&#xD;

      Our senses provide us with a vast amount of information at any given moment in time. For&#xD;
      example, visual scenes contain many different objects that cannot all be processed&#xD;
      simultaneously because of the limited processing capacity of the visual system. Therefore,&#xD;
      attentional mechanisms are required to select relevant objects and filter out irrelevant&#xD;
      ones. There is converging evidence from single-cell recording and lesion studies in monkeys&#xD;
      and functional brain imaging studies in humans that irrelevant information from cluttered&#xD;
      visual scenes is filtered out in extrastriate visual cortex. Functional brain imaging studies&#xD;
      also suggest that these attentional filtering mechanisms are mediated by top-down feedback&#xD;
      signals arising in higher-order areas in frontal and parietal cortex. However, it is not&#xD;
      clear from these studies whether these frontal and parietal brain regions are functionally&#xD;
      significant in attentional control of behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over a particular cortical region can&#xD;
      interfere with cognitive processing in that region, thereby creating a virtual disruption in&#xD;
      the intact human cerebral cortex. Hence, this tool can be used to determine if a brain region&#xD;
      is functionally involved in the performance of a given cognitive function. In the proposed&#xD;
      study, we wish to use TMS to test the hypothesis that attentional filter mechanisms operating&#xD;
      in extrastriate cortex are under &quot;top-down&quot; control by regions in the frontal and parietal&#xD;
      cortex. Our approach will use a combination of TMS and functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, subjects will participate in an fMRI experiment (93-M-0170) designed to localize the&#xD;
      cortical regions of interest (ROIs) that are involved with attentional processing for each&#xD;
      subject. Second, TMS will be used to create transient virtual disruptions in frontal and&#xD;
      parietal ROIs of normal volunteers while they perform a task requiring spatial attention. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that, when TMS is used to interfere with attentional processing, subjects will&#xD;
      show impaired performance in a task that requires them to filter out irrelevant visual&#xD;
      information. In contrast, performance during TMS should not suffer in a control task in which&#xD;
      no irrelevant information needs to be filtered out.&#xD;
