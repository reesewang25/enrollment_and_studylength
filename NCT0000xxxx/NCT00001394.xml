  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occasionally tumors of the parathyroid gland cannot be detected by standard x-ray diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures (CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds). In order for the tumor to be removed surgically&#xD;
      it must first be localized. To do this often requires a procedure known as parathyroid&#xD;
      arteriography and parathyroid venous sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure begins by placing a catheter through a blood vessel in the groin. The catheter&#xD;
      is then guided through blood vessels to reach the area of the neck. The blood vessels in this&#xD;
      region flow in and out of the thyroid and parathyroid. An X-ray dye is then injected through&#xD;
      the catheter into the arteries of the thyroid/parathyroid (parathyroid arteriography). The&#xD;
      alternative is taking a small sample of the veins found in this same region (parathyroid&#xD;
      venous sampling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers prefer parathyroid arteriography because it causes less discomfort to the patient&#xD;
      and requires less experience to do the procedure. However, parathyroid arteriography provides&#xD;
      positive results in only 50% of patients undergoing the procedure. Parathyroid venous&#xD;
      sampling provides greater amounts of positive results but the readings are often imprecise.&#xD;
      Parathyroid tissue secretes a hormone known as PTH (parathyroid hormone). The release of PTH&#xD;
      is stimulated by low levels of calcium in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea behind the study is to inject a dye into the area of the parathyroid that will cause&#xD;
      a release of PTH. Several parathyroid venous samplings will be taken following the abrupt&#xD;
      elevation of PTH. This will provide information on the effectiveness of an intraarterial&#xD;
      hypocalcemic stimulus (injection of dye into the arteries of the parathyroid when calcium&#xD;
      blood levels are low) and venous sampling as techniques to improve localizing parathyroid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      Although noninvasive diagnostic studies [ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), sestamibi&#xD;
      scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] detect parathyroid pathology in one-half the&#xD;
      patients referred to NIH with recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism (1), the invasive&#xD;
      studies (direct aspiration for PTH, arteriography, venous sampling) must be performed in the&#xD;
      remaining patients to provide definitive preoperative localization (2). Arteriography is&#xD;
      positive in less than half the patients who must then proceed to parathyroid venous sampling,&#xD;
      a technique requiring broad experience and yielding positive, but imprecise results as&#xD;
      regards localization. The abrupt lowering of calcium in blood perfusing a parathyroid adenoma&#xD;
      should stimulate the release of PTH which could be detected by simultaneous venous sampling.&#xD;
      This principle, the intraarterial injection of a secretagogue with subsequent sampling for&#xD;
      released hormone, has been applied successfully in the localization of insulinomas (3) and&#xD;
      gastrinomas (4). In fact, portal venous sampling is no longer performed in this group of&#xD;
      patients, having been completely replaced by the intraarterial injection of secretin or&#xD;
      calcium as appropriate secretagogues for gastrin and insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since release of PTH from parathyroid adenomas is stimulated by hypocalcemic perfusions, we&#xD;
      propose to perform serial venous sampling from a catheter positioned in the SVC to detect&#xD;
      abrupt elevations of PTH following the injection of contrast agent into each of the vessels&#xD;
      selectively catheterized at the time of parathyroid arteriography (superior thyroid arteries,&#xD;
      thyrocervical trunks, internal mammary arteries). Samples from the SVC catheter will be&#xD;
      obtained at 20 second intervals up to one minute and in some patients simultaneous peripheral&#xD;
      samples. An elevation of parathyroid hormone 1.5 times above the baseline will be considered&#xD;
      diagnostic. This technique will be applied routinely at each injection of standard&#xD;
      parathyroid arteriography even in the absence of an angiographically-visualized adenoma: an&#xD;
      elevation of PTH will provide localizing information comparable to venous sampling. In&#xD;
      addition, when any of the imaging studies suggest that a particular anatomic site is the&#xD;
      likely location of the patient's adenoma, sodium citrate, a calcium chelating agent, will be&#xD;
      injected into the artery supplying this region. Blood samples will be obtained in similar&#xD;
      fashion to those samples taken with contrast injections to measure PTH release following&#xD;
      sodium citrate injection and determine whether this is a more effective hypocalcemic&#xD;
      stimulant.&#xD;
