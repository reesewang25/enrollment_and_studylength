  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a behavioral intervention, a special kind of&#xD;
      counseling, can reduce the risk of HIV infection in men who have sex with men. The behavioral&#xD;
      intervention will be compared to the standard risk reduction counseling that is given before&#xD;
      and after getting an HIV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In standard pre- and post-test counseling, everyone is told the same things about how to&#xD;
      prevent HIV. The behavioral intervention used in this study is designed to help each&#xD;
      individual prevent HIV according to his specific problems and needs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention being evaluated in this trial is based on the extensive literature on&#xD;
      behavioral approaches to risk reduction in MSM. These reviews recommend an intervention that,&#xD;
      unlike the current standard HIV pre-test and post-test risk-reduction counseling, is tailored&#xD;
      to an individual's unique problems and needs, lifestyle, and situations that contribute to&#xD;
      high-risk behavior. Furthermore, there is a need for HIV-prevention intervention trials using&#xD;
      biological endpoints (e.g., HIV seroconversion) in addition to behavioral change indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either the behavioral intervention or the&#xD;
      control risk-reduction counseling. The same counseling staff provides the two types of&#xD;
      treatment. The behavioral intervention consists of 10 counseling sessions within a 4-month&#xD;
      period followed by quarterly maintenance sessions for the remainder of the 3-year follow-up.&#xD;
      The intervention is conducted on a one-to-one basis and targets condom use, change in sexual&#xD;
      practices associated with HIV risk, and change in sexual practices in the context of alcohol&#xD;
      and drug use. Participants in the control group receive pre- and post-test counseling at&#xD;
      enrollment, then semiannually through Month 36. Beginning at Month 6, all participants&#xD;
      complete routine semiannual visits. At each visit, Risk Assessment and phlebotomy for&#xD;
      specimen collection for HIV antibody tests are administered. As is routine in most public&#xD;
      counseling and testing venues, participants in the control condition do not see the same&#xD;
      counselor consistently.&#xD;
