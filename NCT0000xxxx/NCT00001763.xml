  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disseminated infection with Mycobacteria avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common&#xD;
      systemic bacterial infections in advanced stages of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
      (AIDS). Current therapy for disseminated MAC infection in HIV patients consists of multidrug&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens are often accompanied by toxicities, and many patients become&#xD;
      intolerant of one or more agents. Macrolides are the essential component of successful&#xD;
      therapy, yet macrolide resistant strains are being recognized with increasing frequency.&#xD;
      Thus, there is an interest in identifying additional therapeutic interventions for&#xD;
      disseminated MAC in HIV-infected patients. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a central, regulatory&#xD;
      cytokine in cell-mediated immunity. IL-12 enhances the cytolytic activity of cytotoxic T and&#xD;
      NK cells, and induces interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) production from T and NK cells. This&#xD;
      open-label Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunologic/microbiologic&#xD;
      effects of interleukin-12 administration in HIV-infected patients with concomitant&#xD;
      disseminated Mycobacterium avium (MAC) infection. Fifteen patients with documented&#xD;
      disseminated MAC will be randomized to receive double-blinded placebo or escalating doses of&#xD;
      IL-12 in addition to anti-MAC chemotherapy and standard anti-retroviral therapy for six&#xD;
      weeks. IL-12 will be administered subcutaneously, with escalating doses every month over the&#xD;
      dose range of 30 ng/kg, 100 ng/kg, and 300 ng/kg, or until an individual maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (IMTD) is reached. Should a patient receive 2 consecutive blood cultures negative for&#xD;
      MAC during the course of the study at a lower dose, then he/she will not be further dose&#xD;
      escalated. Those patients receiving placebo after 6 weeks will be crossed over to receive the&#xD;
      full treatment course of IL-12. Each new dose or dose escalation will take place on an&#xD;
      inpatient basis. Once a patient is clinically stable at a dose, the patient will be&#xD;
      maintained at that dose as an outpatient for the remainder of the month. Total IL-12&#xD;
      administration will not exceed 12 weeks, or 24 total doses.&#xD;

      disseminated Mycobacterium avium (MAC) infection or localized MAC infection. Fifteen patients&#xD;
      with documented disseminated MAC will be randomized to receive double-blinded placebo or&#xD;

      cultures negative for MAC during the course of the study at a lower dose, then he/she will&#xD;
      not be further dose escalated. Likewise, patients with localized disease will not be further&#xD;
      dose escalated if symptoms/evidence of localized infection resolve as assessed by the&#xD;
      principal investigator. Those patients receiving placebo after 6 weeks will be crossed over&#xD;
      to receive the full treatment course of IL-12. Each new dose or dose escalation will take&#xD;
      place on an inpatient basis. Once a patient is clinically stable at a dose, the patient will&#xD;
      be maintained at that dose as an outpatient for the remainder of the month. Total IL-12&#xD;

        protocol team may affect patient safety or compliance.&#xD;
