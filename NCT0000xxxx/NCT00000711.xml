      To administer colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 4 weeks to AIDS and advanced AIDS&#xD;
      related complex (ARC) patients who have been receiving zidovudine (AZT) therapy, in order to&#xD;
      obtain data on short-term effectiveness, safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and tolerance of&#xD;
      combined treatment with the two drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons infected with HIV virus may undergo a long latency or persistent virus blood levels&#xD;
      which may be present before any symptomatic illness. These individuals could, therefore,&#xD;
      benefit from therapy with an effective antiretroviral agent. AZT, which is a powerful&#xD;
      inhibitor of human retrovirus, has been approved for management of patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      HIV infection. GM-CSF not only stimulates the bone marrow, it enhances the function of mature&#xD;
      blood cells and has been found to enhance the ability of AZT to suppress HIV replication in&#xD;
      vitro (test tube). Combination therapy with GM-CSF and AZT may lower complications as well as&#xD;
      the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is administered subcutaneously, once a day or every other&#xD;
      day, for 4 weeks to AIDS and advanced ARC patients who have been receiving and will continue&#xD;
      to receive a constant dose of AZT. Treatment is on an outpatient basis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Modest doses of acetaminophen, aspirin, or non-prescription doses of ibuprofen may be&#xD;
             used with caution for fever control and mild analgesia. Prolonged use more than 72&#xD;
             hours is not advised without dose supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients should have a documented history of positive HIV antibody by ELISA test.&#xD;
        Patients should qualify for zidovudine (AZT) treatment for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior episode of cytologically confirmed Pneumocystis carinii&#xD;
             pneumonia (PCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior episode of any AIDS-defining opportunistic infection and less&#xD;
             than 200 T4 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced ARC as defined by mucocutaneous candidiasis and/or unexplained&#xD;
             weight loss and less than 200 T4 cells and fever more than 100 degrees F of more than&#xD;
             3 weeks duration; clinical diagnosis of hairy leukoplakia; herpes zoster infection&#xD;
             within 3 months of entry; or unexplained diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have received at least 8 weeks of AZT prior to enrollment and must&#xD;
             not have required a dose adjustment for the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to sign an informed consent statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Required:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zidovudine (AZT) for at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following patients will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving zidovudine (AZT) while enrolled in another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other life-threatening and uncontrolled opportunistic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of lymphoma or neoplasm other than indolent Kaposi's sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;

             may increase the risk of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Probenecid may inhibit excretion of zidovudine (AZT). Some experimental nucleoside analogs&#xD;
        should be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following patients will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving zidovudine (AZT) while enrolled in another protocol.&#xD;
