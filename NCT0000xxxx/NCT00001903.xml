  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections are very common and widespread. By age 5,&#xD;
      virtually everyone has been infected and developed antibodies against some strain of the&#xD;
      virus. RSV infections happen during adulthood, leading to common cold syndromes. In Bone&#xD;
      Marrow Transplant recipients the disease is much more severe, usually progressing to&#xD;
      pneumonia. This phenomenon is associated with mortality rates around 60-80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSV Polyclonal Immunoglobulin (Respigam速 (Registered Trademark)) has been approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for&#xD;
      prophylaxis of RSV disease in premature babies and children born with bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia. Furthermore, it has been used to treat RSV pneumonia in children and Bone Marrow&#xD;
      Transplant recipients with encouraging results and no complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no preventive strategies are available when approaching this infection among bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant patients. We intend to prevent our bone marrow transplant patients from&#xD;
      developing RSV pneumonia by employing the strategy already used in premature babies, i.e., by&#xD;
      passive immunization with Respigam速 (Registered Trademark). Our goal to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of this strategy in such immunocompromised population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that this will be a more reasonable approach than waiting for the infection to&#xD;
      settle in and only then treating it, because optimal therapy is not currently available.&#xD;

        Male or female patients who are between the ages of 2 and 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit for a bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
        (BMT), peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) or mini-transplantation (MT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be in the early phase of BMT, PSCT or MT, i.e., receiving conditioning therapy for the&#xD;
        transplant or within the first 30 days of receiving a bone marrow graft or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be greater than 30 days post-engraftment but being treated for Graft vs. Host disease&#xD;
        (GVHD) with a total dose of equal to or greater than 1.5 grams/m(2) of methylprednisolone&#xD;
        (or equivalent dose of steroids) over the first 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have a negative result (at 48 hours) for RSV in the screening respiratory viral&#xD;
        culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Less than 8 days have elapsed between meeting eligibility criteria, being contacted by one&#xD;
        of the investigators, and making a decision to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with signs or symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract infection or pneumonia will be&#xD;
        excluded until the etiology is established or RSV is ruled-out by the screening culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded if they have any condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator, could affect their safety, preclude evaluation of response, or render&#xD;
        unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy can be completed.&#xD;
