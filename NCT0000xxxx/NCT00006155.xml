  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SU5416, a novel antiangiogenesis agent, has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor&#xD;
      of the tyrosine kinase activity of FlK-1 (a downstream effector of VEGF) in vitro and to&#xD;
      inhibit the growth of endothelial cells. Since VEGF mRNA levels and vessel counts in tumor&#xD;
      tissues have been shown to be inversely related to prognosis in ovarian cancer, SU5416 may&#xD;
      prove to be a useful agent in this disease. Platinum agents currently provide the most&#xD;
      effective treatment for ovarian cancer. However, ovarian cancer often becomes refractory to&#xD;
      platinum therapy, leaving the patient with a poor prognosis. This is a phase I study designed&#xD;
      to: a) determine a dose level of carboplatin to use in combination with an established dose&#xD;
      of SU5416 for treatment of patients with platinum-refractory ovarian cancer, b) assess the&#xD;
      side effect profile of SU5416 and carboplatin combination therapy, c) characterize any&#xD;
      alterations in SU5416 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters when given in&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin, d) characterize carboplatin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      parameters when given in combination with SU5416, e) do exploratory studies to assess the&#xD;
      effect of SU5416 on platinum-DNA adduct levels, f) do exploratory studies to assess any&#xD;
      alterations in ERCC1 mRNA levels when carboplatin is administered with SU5416, and g) obtain&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of the ability of SU5416 to reverse platinum resistance in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-refractory ovarian carcinoma.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Must have histopathologically documented epithelial ovarian carcinoma confirmed in the&#xD;
        Laboratory of Pathology, at the National Cancer Institute prior to starting this study.&#xD;
        Also eligible will be patients with the histologic diagnosis of: Recurrent primary&#xD;
        fallopian tube cancers; Recurrent primary peritoneal cancers (non-mesothelioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have either measurable disease by physical exam or radiographic imaging, or patients&#xD;
        must have evaluable disease. Evaluable disease will include patients with third-space fluid&#xD;
        accumulations that are proven to be positive for adenocarcinoma; and patients with an&#xD;
        elevated CA125 above 100 IU per mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have platinum-refractory disease (persistent or recurrent disease within 6 months of&#xD;
        last cisplatin or carboplatin therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have a life expectancy of more than 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with medical or surgical complications requiring immediate intervention, but&#xD;
        may enroll after resolution of the acute problem (e.g. impending bowel obstruction, active&#xD;
        infection, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        PT and PTT must be less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have recovered from any toxicity related to prior therapy to NCI/CTEP Grade 0, or 1,&#xD;
        with the exception of peripheral neuropathy, in which case grade 2 toxicity is permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Granulocyte count must be greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;

        Platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acute care panel (electrolytes, BUN) and urinalysis should be considered normal for each&#xD;
        patient in the judgement of the clinic attending (blood glucose is excluded from this&#xD;
        evaluation). No gross abnormalities should be present. &quot;Normal&quot; will be defined as the&#xD;
