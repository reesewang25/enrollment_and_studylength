  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that specialized pacemaking devices (DDD pacing) can improve the&#xD;
      symptoms associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in adults. In addition, studies&#xD;
      have also shown that specialized pacemaking devices (DDD pacing) can improve conditions of&#xD;
      HCM in children. However, growth of the body and organs, including the heart, is very rapid&#xD;
      during childhood. Therefore the long-term effects of DDD pacing in children are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the growth rate and nutrition of children with HCM.&#xD;
      Due to this heart condition and the restrictions that are often placed on the child's&#xD;
      activity level, children with HCM may grow at a slower rat and may have a greater tendency to&#xD;
      be overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children participating in the study will have their growth rate and nutritional status&#xD;
      measured before the study begins and throughout the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings in this research study will not directly benefit the patients participating in it.&#xD;
      However, information gathered as a result of this study may lead to improvements in the&#xD;
      management of children with HCM in the future.&#xD;

      Several studies have shown that dual chamber (DDD) pacemaker therapy relieves LV outflow&#xD;
      obstruction and improves symptoms in most adult patients with obstructive hypertrophic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (HCM). It is however, uncertain whether DDD pacing will be efficacious in&#xD;
      children with obstructive HCM, because of evolving cardiac morphology and increased LV&#xD;
      hypertrophy and outflow obstruction associated with rapid body growth. We propose to monitor&#xD;
      clinical progress, and cardiac morphologic and hemodynamic changes over several years&#xD;
      following implantation of a DDD pacemaker in children who present with obstructive HCM&#xD;
      between the ages of 5 to 15 years. Functional status, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and&#xD;
      LV outflow obstruction will be evaluated by exercise tests, echocardiography, thallium&#xD;
      scintigraphy, Holter monitoring, electrophysiologic and cardiac catheterization studies. The&#xD;
      results of pacemaker therapy will be compared with the findings in a cohort of young patients&#xD;
      with obstructive HCM who elect not to be treated with DDD pacemaker.&#xD;
