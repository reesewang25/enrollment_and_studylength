  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, minimum effective dose (MED), pharmacokinetics and efficacy of orally&#xD;
      administered 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (d4T) in patients with AIDS or AIDS&#xD;
      related complex (ARC). To establish an appropriate dosage regimen of d4T to be employed in&#xD;
      Phase II and III trials. To evaluate the effects of de-escalating doses of d4T on markers&#xD;
      associated with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only FDA-approved therapy for patients with AIDS or ARC is zidovudine (AZT), a&#xD;
      drug with significant value but limited use because of toxic effects on the bone marrow. d4T&#xD;
      has not been tested in humans, but it has inhibited the reproduction of HIV (the virus that&#xD;
      causes AIDS) in laboratory experiments. In some studies with laboratory animals, d4T was less&#xD;
      toxic against blood cells than AZT.&#xD;

      Currently, the only FDA-approved therapy for patients with AIDS or ARC is zidovudine (AZT), a&#xD;
      drug with significant value but limited use because of toxic effects on the bone marrow. d4T&#xD;
      has not been tested in humans, but it has inhibited the reproduction of HIV (the virus that&#xD;
      causes AIDS) in laboratory experiments. In some studies with laboratory animals, d4T was less&#xD;
      toxic against blood cells than AZT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been found in Phase I trials to date. An MED will be&#xD;
      determined. The daily dose of d4T is divided into 2 portions and administered approximately&#xD;
      12 hours apart for 10 weeks. 5 patients receive the initial dose level and successive groups&#xD;
      of 5 patients enter the study at a lower dose level once 3 patients in the preceding group&#xD;
      have successfully completed at least 3 weeks of dosing and shown a positive effect on CD4&#xD;
      cell count and p24 antigen levels. The initial group of patients continue dosing at their&#xD;
      dose level for an additional 94 weeks as long as they are doing well as measured by p24&#xD;
      antigen levels and CD4 cell counts. The dose de-escalation scheme continues until a lack of&#xD;
      efficacy is seen in 2 of 5 patients in any group. Patients are assigned to de-escalating dose&#xD;
      level treatment groups in the order in which they are enrolled. Blood and urine samples are&#xD;
      taken regularly to check for toxic effects and therapeutic effectiveness. In each dosing&#xD;
      group, 3 of 5 patients will be p24 antigen positive greater than or equal to 70 pg/ml, and 2&#xD;
      of 5 patients will have CDC-defined AIDS.&#xD;

             grade 4 anemia (see Recommendations for Grading of Acute and Subacute Toxic Effects&#xD;
