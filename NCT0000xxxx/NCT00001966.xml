  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of mind-body therapy in relieving pain in patients&#xD;
      with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This syndrome is a hereditary condition caused by a connective&#xD;
      tissue defect and is often associated with chronic pain poorly controlled by medication or&#xD;
      physical therapy. Mind-body therapy comprises various complementary or alternative medicine&#xD;
      techniques such as meditation, guided imagery, stress management, and group psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome who have chronic pain may be eligible for this 4&#xD;
      1/2 [Note: if the symbol is unreadable, it is four and one-half] to 5-month study. Patients&#xD;
      not already enrolled in NHGRI's protocol 97-HG-0089 will undergo a history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and brief interview before being accepted. Participants will attend 2-hour group&#xD;
      sessions of mind-body therapy at NIH each week for at least 10 weeks. They will receive&#xD;
      training in meditation, yoga breathing, guided imagery, and stress management in these&#xD;
      sessions and will be asked to also practice the treatments at home each day. Patients may&#xD;
      continue their regular medications and pain treatment with their private physicians during&#xD;
      the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out a packet of questionnaires about their pain, health, and quality&#xD;
      of life at three intervals: when they enroll in the study, at the end of treatment, and 12&#xD;
      weeks after treatment ends. At these same time intervals, patients will come to NIH for a&#xD;
      test of their physical ability to walk and climb stairs. Patients will keep a diary and pain&#xD;
      symptoms and medications for 1 week before treatment begins and 1 week after it ends, and&#xD;
      will fill out questionnaires about pain during the entire study period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) encompasses a spectrum of connective tissue diseases thought to&#xD;
      result from defects in collagen formation. People with EDS are often affected by chronic,&#xD;
      progressive pain poorly responsive to conventional treatment. We propose to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of mind-body therapy for treatment of chronic pain in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. A&#xD;
      cohort of adult subjects will be treated with mind-body therapy in a pilot study to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and acceptability of this treatment modality. The primary outcome measure will&#xD;
      be change in pain as scored with a standardized inventory. We will also evaluate general&#xD;
      health status, psychological variables, medication usage, and physical performance abilities.&#xD;
