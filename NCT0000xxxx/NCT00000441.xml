    <textblock>
      This project will provide relevant clinical information for primary care practitioners&#xD;
      treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome in outpatient settings. This double-blind, placebo-&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of lorazepam (Ativan) and&#xD;
      carbamazepine (Tegretol) in alcoholics who meet the criteria for a diagnosis of uncomplicated&#xD;
      alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Participants are randomized to five days of treatment with a&#xD;
      1-week posttreatment followup.&#xD;
