      To investigate the genetic influence of candidate gene polymorphisms on risk factors for the&#xD;
      metabolic insulin resistance syndrome in Japanese American sibships and kindreds. The&#xD;
      original grant in 1994 had as its objective to understand the genetic epidemiology of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in Japanese- American families with probands living&#xD;
      in Seattle, Washington.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although each of the risk factors have recently been associated with increased risk of CHD&#xD;
      and are known to be genetically influenced, none of them have been investigated in a large&#xD;
      sample of American families of Japanese ancestry. The project represents a unique and timely&#xD;
      opportunity to characterize the genetic epidemiology of CHD risk factors among Japanese&#xD;
      Americans. The findings could lead to the development of effective preventive strategies&#xD;
      targeted to subgroups of individuals with high risk due to underlying genetic susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the original study, several hypotheses were tested, including: 1) that a predominance of&#xD;
      small LDL particles (ALP phenotype B), as determined by gradient gel electrophoresis, was&#xD;
      inherited as a single gene trait in Japanese-American kindreds and to compare these results&#xD;
      with previous studies in Caucasian families; 2) that ALP-B was associated with risk factors&#xD;
      characteristic of the insulin resistance syndrome and NIDDM among individual&#xD;
      Japanese-American family members. 3) that plasma levels of Lp(a) were inversely associated&#xD;
      with apo(a) size phenotypes, as determined by high- resolution SDS-agarose-gel&#xD;
      electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, in individual Japanese-American subjects, and to&#xD;
      compare and contrast these associations with those previously reported in Caucasians and&#xD;
      other ethnic groups; 4) that in addition to apo(a) gene effects, the segregation of plasma&#xD;
      levels of Lp(a) in families was nherited consistent with the presence of another single major&#xD;
      gene effect. The study also established a repository of frozen white cells for future genetic&#xD;
      studies of candidate genes associated with risk of CHD in Japanese Americans. These&#xD;
      hypotheses were all tested based on blood samples, blood pressure and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, and questionnaire data from 33 Japanese-American kindreds identified through&#xD;
      participants in the ongoing Japanese-American Community Diabetes Study in Seattle. The&#xD;
      kindreds consist of 126 nuclear families and 443 individual family members, including&#xD;
      probands, siblings, spouses, offspring and nieces and nephews of full Japanese descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1998, the renewal has three specific aims. The first aim was to identify genetic&#xD;
      influences on the risk factors that characterize ther metabolic insulin resistance syndrome&#xD;
      (including fasting insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide and glucose; body weight and waist&#xD;
      circumference; lipoproteins; blood pressure; fibrinogen; factor VII and plasminogen activator&#xD;
      inhibitor. Statistical genetic analysis approaches used in the first aim included univariate&#xD;
      complex segregation analysis, factor analysis, and quantitative multivariate genetic&#xD;
      analysis. The second specific aim was to test for genetic linkage between specific candidate&#xD;
      genes involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, blood pressure, obesity, and&#xD;
      hemostasis with genetically influenced risk factors of the metabolic syndrome in&#xD;
      Japanese-Americans. The third specific aim was, when the DNA repository had been completed&#xD;
      (750 samples by the end of year four), to apply to the NHLBI Mammalian Genotyping Service to&#xD;
      perform a whole genome screen to identify new genes involved in susceptibility to the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
