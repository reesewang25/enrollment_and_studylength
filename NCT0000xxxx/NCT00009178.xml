  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bulimia Nervosa is a frequent problem for young women. It is widely assumed that this&#xD;
      disorder cannot be treated effectively in a primary care setting. This assumption has never&#xD;
      been tested empirically, and is probably incorrect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last 15 years, effective treatment interventions for Bulimia Nervosa have been&#xD;
      developed and validated in specialized treatment centers. The broad aim of this proposal is&#xD;
      to examine whether these treatments, suitably adapted, can be usefully transferred to general&#xD;
      health care settings. Specifically, the proposed study will determine the relative and&#xD;
      combined effectiveness of the two leading treatments for Bulimia Nervosa in a primary care&#xD;
      setting. The two major interventions are treatment with an antidepressant medication,&#xD;
      fluoxetine, and with a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, guided self-help, designed for&#xD;
      use in primary care.&#xD;
