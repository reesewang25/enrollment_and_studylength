    <textblock>
      To analyze existing data from the Physicians Health Study (PHS), a randomized primary&#xD;
      prevention trial of low-dose aspirin and beta carotene conducted among 22,071 U.S. male&#xD;
      physicians, to address questions concerning aspirin and cardiovascular (CV) disease that&#xD;
      could not adequately be addressed during the randomized aspirin period.&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aspirin component of the trial was terminated on January 25, 1988, due to a demonstrated&#xD;
      benefit of aspirin on myocardial infarction. At that time, however, the number of strokes and&#xD;
      CV deaths experienced by trial participants was inadequate to definitively evaluate these&#xD;
      endpoints. The beta carotene component of the trial continued uninterrupted until its&#xD;
      scheduled termination in December, 1996. During this period detailed information continued to&#xD;
      be collected on post-trial aspirin use through annual questionnaires. As of October, 1995,&#xD;
      the number of deaths, including cardiovascular deaths, had increased fourfold from that in&#xD;
      the randomized period, and the number of strokes had increased 3.5 times. The investigators&#xD;
      used data from both the randomized aspirin period and the observational period following the&#xD;
      trial to assess the impact of aspirin use on cardiovascular and total mortality, and the&#xD;
      long-term impact of aspirin use on subsequent stroke and MI. The methods included analyses of&#xD;
      both randomized aspirin assignment and of time-varying aspirin use, as assessed on the annual&#xD;
      questionnaires. Because of the potential for bias, the propensity for aspirin use,&#xD;
      particularly during the observational period was taken into account. Analyses included use of&#xD;
      proportional hazards models allowing for both time-varying effects of aspirin use and&#xD;
      controlling for time-varying confounders, as well as more complex procedures using causal&#xD;
      modeling.&#xD;
