      Children who are at risk for problems in school may do better if they and their parents are&#xD;
      taught how to communicate with each other between age 3 and 6 when the children enter&#xD;
      kindergarten. Three groups of 3 year olds who are in Head Start in the Nashville area will be&#xD;
      randomized with their parents to either a 3 year program of skill building or to a control&#xD;
      (Head Start only). The children will be tested at the end of the 3 year study and 6 months, 1&#xD;
      year and 2 years later.&#xD;

      Once established, childhood conduct and behavior disorders are robust and have consistently&#xD;
      negative effects on the social and academic behavior of children and adolescents. Early&#xD;
      intervention to prevent the development of these disorders is an important alternative to&#xD;
      intervention after problem behaviors are well established. Two factors, negative patterns of&#xD;
      parent-child interaction associated with poor parenting skills and significant communication&#xD;
      deficits, are strongly associated with childhood conduct and behavior disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an experimental investigation of a multicomponent, longitudinal intervention&#xD;
      with families and children to prevent conduct and behavior disorders in children at high risk&#xD;
      for these disorders. The goals of this study are to 1) describe the incidence of significant&#xD;
      social problems related to conduct disorders among 3-year old children enrolled in Head Start&#xD;
      and 2) examine the effectiveness of an intervention on the behavior of children identified&#xD;
      with emergent behavior problems or at highest risk for these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two phases within this study. In the first phase, 750 three-year-olds will be&#xD;
      screened for early indicators of behavior problems and communications deficits using reports&#xD;
      of child behavior from parents and teachers, direct assessment of children, and assessments&#xD;
      of family support and stress that signal risk for conduct disorder to identify children at&#xD;
      highest risk. Data from the first phase will provide information regarding the incidence of&#xD;
      behavior problems, allow determination of the most reliable indicators of increased risk&#xD;
      status and to explore the specific relationship between early communication development and&#xD;
      increased risk for behavior problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase examines the immediate and longer term effects of prevention intervention to&#xD;
      improve children's social behavior and communication skills. Three-year-old children (n=180)&#xD;
      that are attending community daycares or therapeutic nurseries serving low-income families,&#xD;
      and that have mild to moderate language delays and patterns of parent-child interaction&#xD;
      associated with poor behavioral outcomes will be recruited. One hundred and eighty children&#xD;
      at high risk for development of conduct disorders and related behavioral problems will be&#xD;
      randomized to either an intervention group (n=90) or an untreated control group (n=90). Three&#xD;
      successive cohorts of children and families will be randomly assigned to treatment or control&#xD;
      groups; each cohort will be followed three years until the child enters kindergarten. The&#xD;
      primary intervention will include parent training in communicative interactions and behavior&#xD;
      management and direct intervention with the child to teach social communication skills in&#xD;
      peer interactions. Secondary intervention will include classroom consultation, maintenance of&#xD;
      parent training and child intervention as needed, family support and liaison services, and&#xD;
      assistance during child transition into kindergarten. Local Head Start collaborators are&#xD;
      included in all phases of the trial. The outcomes of the trial will be examined at four&#xD;
      points - immediately after the study period is completed, 6 months later, 1 year later, and 2&#xD;
      years later. The last assessment will focus on academic, social, and mental health outcomes&#xD;
      at the end of the children's kindergarten year. Positive effects on children's problem&#xD;
      behaviors, social skills, and overall development and positive effects on parent-child&#xD;
      interaction are expected to be associated with participation in the treatment condition.&#xD;
