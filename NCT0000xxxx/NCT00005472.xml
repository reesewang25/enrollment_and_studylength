      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease accounts for 43 percent of all deaths in the United States.&#xD;
      Hypertension affects as many as 50 million Americans, however the causes of essential&#xD;
      hypertension are not well known. A new CVD risk factor (&quot;job strain&quot;) has emerged as a&#xD;
      potential major cause of essential hypertension. By 1995, over 20 studies had found&#xD;
      significant positive relationships between &quot;job strain&quot; and CVD, coronary heart disease,&#xD;
      all-cause mortality or hypertension. &quot;Job strain&quot; is defined as high psychological workload&#xD;
      demands combined with low&quot;decision latitude&quot;. An expanded concept of &quot;job strain&quot; which&#xD;
      included low workplace social support (&quot;iso-strain&quot;) was developed and examined in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important questions remained to be answered about &quot;job strain&quot;, CVD and hypertension. In most&#xD;
      studies, &quot;job strain&quot; was only measured at one point in time, while, in fact, cumulative&#xD;
      exposure to &quot;job strain&quot; was believed to be the risk factor. In addition, most studies relied&#xD;
      on self-report measures of &quot;job strain&quot;. Also, no studies specifically examined risk of&#xD;
      stroke and &quot;job strain&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Cornell University cohort study of Psychosocial Factors and Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Disease and the Columbia University-Northern Manhattan Stroke Study were analyzed. The study&#xD;
      had five specific aims, including to determine whether: blood pressure levels were associated&#xD;
      with cumulative exposure to &quot;job strain&quot;; differences in blood pressure increases were&#xD;
      associated with an objective measure of &quot;job strain&quot;; increased risk of stroke was associated&#xD;
      with an objective measure of &quot;job strain&quot;; changes in psychological variables over time were&#xD;
      associated with job characteristics; changes in CVD risk factors (other than hypertension)&#xD;
      were associated with job characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paul Landsbergis also constructed measures of cumulative exposure to &quot;job strain&quot; and&#xD;
      determined their association with blood pressure, and analyzed the association between job&#xD;
      characteristics and change in psychological variables and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
