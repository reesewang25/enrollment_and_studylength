      To implement a culturally appropriate school-based, multicenter, randomized trial that&#xD;
      promotes healthful eating behaviors and increases physical activity to prevent obesity in&#xD;
      pre-adolescent upper elementary American Indian students.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Indian population, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, totals nearly&#xD;
      1.5 million from over 500 tribes and nearly 300 reservations and Alaska Native villages.&#xD;
      Earlier in this century, heart disease was rarely noted in American Indians, but in the past&#xD;
      decade, cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of death in American Indians.&#xD;
      Several factors may be responsible for this increase: a decreasing incidence of infectious&#xD;
      disease, an increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus, and an increasing incidence of&#xD;
      obesity. Previous research on non-Indian populations indicates that obesity is an independent&#xD;
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease and that it is associated with increases in other&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and low high&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The high prevalence of obesity among American&#xD;
      Indians, coupled with its role as a risk factor for hypertension, coronary heart disease, and&#xD;
      diabetes, suggests that a reduction in the average weight of young American Indians would&#xD;
      improve their health. Reduction of the prevalence of obesity in American Indians has been&#xD;
      designated as a goal for improving the health of this minority population and reducing health&#xD;
      disparities in our nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The successful 4-1/2 year feasibility study was followed by the full-scale randomized trial&#xD;
      involving 1,700 American Indian elementary schoolchildren. Schools were the unit of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiative was developed as a result of consultations with the NHLBI Ad Hoc Committee on&#xD;
      Minority Populations, the Conference on Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease in Minority&#xD;
      Populations, and the Indian Health Service. The need for the study was reinforced by the&#xD;
      preliminary data from the Strong Heart Study confirming the high prevalence of obesity in&#xD;
      American Indians. The initiative was approved by the Clinical Applications and Prevention&#xD;
      Advisory Committee in February 1992 and given concept clearance by the National Heart, Lung,&#xD;
      and Blood Advisory Council in May 1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Feasibility Phase of the trial was completed in 1995. The organizational structure has&#xD;
      been established, validation studies to determine an endpoint and formative assessment of the&#xD;
      tribe communities was completed. Intervention including classroom curriculum, food service,&#xD;
      physical activity family component and for the measurement methods including obesity,&#xD;
      physical activity, diet intake, knowledge, attitudes and behavior, and process evaluation&#xD;
      were completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full-scale trial started in September 1996. The primary aim was to test the effectivenes&#xD;
      of a culturally appropriate school-based intervention that promoted increased physical&#xD;
      activity and healthful eating behaviors to prevent obesity in American Indian upper&#xD;
      elementary school children. The primary outcome was percent body fat after three years of&#xD;
      intervention. The major hypothesis was that intervention would result in an absolute&#xD;
      difference of 3 percent body fat between the control and intervention schools. All students&#xD;
      enrolled in the second grade in the participating schools during Spring, 1997 participated in&#xD;
      the baseline survey. Baseline measurements were performed at the end of second grade so that&#xD;
      the intervention could begin at the start of third grade. The intervention lasted for three&#xD;
      years. A single cohort of children progressed through third, fourth, and fifth grades.&#xD;
      Schools were the unit of randomization. Forty-one schools in four centers were stratified&#xD;
      within each field center on median percent body fat (PBF) at the end of second grade using&#xD;
      data from the baseline measurement. Schools within a field center were then ranked on median&#xD;
      PBF. Once stratified, the coordinating center randomly assigned half the schools within each&#xD;
      stratum to intervention (21) and half to control (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
