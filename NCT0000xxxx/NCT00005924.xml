  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of long-term antiviral therapy with valaciclovir&#xD;
      (Valtrex) on Epstein-Barr virus infection. This virus infects more than 95 percent of people&#xD;
      in the United States. Most are infected in childhood, have no symptoms, and are unaware of&#xD;
      their infection. People infected as adolescents or adults may develop infectious&#xD;
      mononucleosis, which usually resolves completely. Once infected, most people shed the virus&#xD;
      from their throat occasionally, and all carry the virus in their white blood cells for life.&#xD;
      This study will determine whether the amount of virus in the blood declines or disappears&#xD;
      with long-term valaciclovir treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers who are not taking any antiviral medicines and patients enrolled in NIH's&#xD;
      protocol no. 97-I-0168 (Evaluation of Valaciclovir for Prevention of Herpes Simplex Virus&#xD;
      Transmission) or Glaxo-Wellcome protocol HS2AB 3009 at collaborating centers may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Patients in the multi-center study must be about to start valaciclovir&#xD;
      therapy for at least 1 year. All candidates must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be seen in clinic for about 1 hour every 3 months for a year. During&#xD;
      these visits, they will provide information about the medicines they are taking, gargle twice&#xD;
      with salt water and spit the fluid into a tube, and have blood drawn (no more than 8&#xD;
      teaspoons each visit). The blood and gargled fluid will be tested for the amount of&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus and antibodies to the virus. (Blood samples will also be tested for HLA&#xD;
      type in order to do immunologic studies in the laboratory. HLA is a marker of the immune&#xD;
      system that is similar to blood-typing testing.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results in people taking valaciclovir will be compared with those in people not taking&#xD;
      the drug. People whose results show the virus has disappeared from the body will continue to&#xD;
      be followed twice a year for 5 years with the blood and gargling tests to continue to look&#xD;
      for evidence of virus. Also, people who develop symptoms resembling mononucleosis (e.g.,&#xD;
      enlarged lymph nodes with fever and sore throat) will be asked to have their blood tested for&#xD;
      the virus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the cause of heterophile-positive infectious mononucleosis. After&#xD;
      primary EBV infection, the virus persists in resting memory B lymphocytes and can be detected&#xD;
      in oropharyngeal secretions. Short term (1 month) treatment with oral acyclovir, which&#xD;
      inhibits EBV replication, results in loss of virus shedding from the oropharynx, but the&#xD;
      virus persists in B cells. The goal of this study is to determine if EBV will no longer&#xD;
      persist in B cells in patients treated with long term (20 month) oral valaciclovir (which is&#xD;
      metabolized to acyclovir). Blood samples and throat washings will be obtained every three&#xD;
      months from individuals who are receiving valaciclovir for treatment of genital herpes&#xD;
      simplex virus infection. These samples will be analyzed for EBV DNA to determine if the level&#xD;
      of EBV DNA declines or becomes negative with long term antiviral therapy. If the level of EBV&#xD;
      DNA becomes undetectable in EBV-seropositive persons during the study, we will ask the&#xD;
      patients to return twice a year for five years or if they develop symptoms of mononucleosis,&#xD;
      so that EBV DNA in their blood and throat washings can be studied. Knowledge gained from this&#xD;
      study should provide important insights into the mechanism of persistence of EBV infection.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. 18 years of age or older and deemed healthy by current medical status and&#xD;
                  laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Willing to be seen every three months for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Have symptomatic recurrent genital herpes disease confirmed by their private&#xD;
                  medical doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Eligible for suppressive antiviral therapy for genital herpes disease: history of&#xD;
                  genital herpes AND either a positive culture for HSV from the genital area or a&#xD;
                  positive serology for HSV-2 from the patient's private physician. If the subject&#xD;
                  does not have a positive HSV genital culture or HSV-2 serology, we will confirm&#xD;
                  the diagnosis by an HSV-2 Western Blot.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Recurrence rate between 3 and 9 recurrences a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Have never taken or have been off HSV suppressive therapy for three months prior&#xD;
