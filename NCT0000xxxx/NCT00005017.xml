  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how effective and safe it is to give 1 of the 3 following&#xD;
      treatments to patients who may not have received anti-HIV treatment: 1) lamivudine&#xD;
      (3TC)/abacavir (ABC)/stavudine (d4T); 2) 3TC/ABC/efavirenz (EFV); or 3) 3TC/ABC/amprenavir&#xD;
      (APV)/ritonavir (RTV).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to initiate antiretroviral therapy in 1 of 3 treatment groups. Within&#xD;
      each group they are stratified based on HIV-1 plasma RNA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients receive 3TC/ABC/d4T; Group 2: Patients receive 3TC/ABC/EFV; and Group 3:&#xD;
      Patients receive 3TC/ABC/APV/RTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment continues for 96 weeks. Blood samples are collected to measure plasma HIV RNA and&#xD;
      CD4 counts and patients are assessed regularly. In the event of incomplete viral suppression&#xD;
      or virologic failure, patients will be switched to secondary therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this trial if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load of at least 5,000 copies/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a CD4 count of at least 50 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to practice effective methods of birth control while on the study, if a woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are not eligible for this trial if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Are pregnant or breast-feeding. Have ever taken anti-HIV drugs. (Less than 2 weeks of prior&#xD;
        anti-HIV treatment is allowed.) Have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic illness&#xD;
        (except for Kaposi's sarcoma involving skin) within 45 days of the screening visit.&#xD;
        Treatment for the illness must have been completed at least 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Are enrolled in another study where the medication may interfere with the control of viral&#xD;
        load in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a serious medical condition such as diabetes or heart problems that would make it&#xD;
        unsafe to be on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a history of a severe nerve disease of the type that may cause muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have had pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas) or hepatitis within 6 months of starting the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have had radiation treatment or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry, or think&#xD;
        those treatments may be needed during the study period. Local treatment for Kaposi's&#xD;
        sarcoma is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have used certain medications, including vaccines, that interfere with the immune system&#xD;
        within 4 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have taken an HIV vaccine within 3 months prior to entry. Are taking St. John's wort. Have&#xD;
        a history of being allergic to any of the study drugs.&#xD;
