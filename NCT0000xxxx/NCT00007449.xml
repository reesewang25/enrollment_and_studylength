  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the study drug DPC&#xD;
      083 combined with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients who are failing their nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some studies DPC 083 (an NNRTI) has been found to lower the amount of HIV in the blood&#xD;
      (viral load), where drug-resistant types of HIV were not lowered by other NNRTIs. This study&#xD;
      will attempt to determine how safe DPC 083 is when it is taken in combination with 2 NRTIs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical and human pharmacokinetic data suggest that DPC 083 can be administered once&#xD;
      daily and provide trough plasma concentrations of free drug that will suppress replication of&#xD;
      HIV-1, including strains containing key resistance mutations observed after failure of&#xD;
      treatment with currently available NNRTIs. This study will provide an assessment of safety&#xD;
      and a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of DPC 083 when administered at a dose of 100 mg&#xD;
      once daily in combination with 2 NRTIs, in a population of HIV-1-infected patients who are&#xD;
      failing treatment with an NNRTI-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive DPC 083 once daily in combination with 2 NRTIs. The 2 NRTIs are selected by&#xD;
      the investigators, based on HIV-1 genotyping results. Analyses for patient safety and drug&#xD;
      efficacy are done at Weeks 8, 24, and 48 using results from clinical laboratory tests and&#xD;
      physical exams. Patients continue to receive DPC 083 and NRTIs until the last patient&#xD;
      enrolled in the study completes 48 weeks of treatment. Patients return for post-therapy&#xD;
      follow-up visits at 1 and 3 months following early termination or study completion. Some&#xD;
      patients may participate in a substudy which evaluates changes in HIV-1 levels in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weigh at least 50 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have documented evidence of virologic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have screening HIV genotype done while receiving NNRTI treatment, or within 2 weeks&#xD;
             after stopping the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) of at least 1,000 copies/ml within 45&#xD;
             days prior to Day 1 of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are willing to use an effective barrier method of birth control during the study.&#xD;
             Birth control agents taken by mouth or placed under the skin should not be used as the&#xD;
             only method of birth control. If the patient stops taking the study drug, he or she&#xD;
             should continue to use birth control for the following 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had virologic failure of any treatment containing an HIV protease inhibitor drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had virologic failure of more than 1 treatment containing an NNRTI drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have participated in any study using DPC 083.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Were treated with any experimental NNRTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have cancer that requires systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of blood clotting problems.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have not met requirements for HIV genotyping results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any disease other than HIV infection or other medical problems that the&#xD;
             researchers think may interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have difficulty swallowing capsules/tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had treatment with immunomodulatory agents such as interferons, interleukins, or&#xD;
             thalidomide within 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are using or have used systemic drugs, including glucocorticoids, that suppress the&#xD;
             immune system, for over 2 weeks. (Low levels of prednisone are allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have used carbamazepine, phenytoin, or Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) within&#xD;
             30 days of beginning study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had any vaccination within 3 weeks before study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received any experimental therapy within 30 days of beginning study treatment.&#xD;
