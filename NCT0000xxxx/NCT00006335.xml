  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what factors influence adolescent girls' decisions&#xD;
      regarding testing for carrier status of X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (XSCID). It&#xD;
      will provide information about how healthy relatives feel about whether they could be XSCID&#xD;
      carriers, whether carrier testing should be pursued, and, if so, at what age. Commonly known&#xD;
      as &quot;Bubble Boy Disease,&quot; XSCID is a rare, life-threatening immune system disorder that&#xD;
      affects only males, but females who carry the gene mutation can pass the disease to their&#xD;
      male children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent girls 13 to 17 years old who have a relative with XSCID and are known to be at&#xD;
      risk for being carriers are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive genetic counseling to help them decide if they want to be tested&#xD;
      for the XSCID gene. Those who elect to be tested will provide a DNA sample from either a&#xD;
      blood draw or brushing taken from inside the mouth. They will receive the test results from&#xD;
      the same genetic counselor they spoke with before the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also talk with a psychologist over the phone once a year for 3 years to&#xD;
      answer questions about how they are feeling and what they know about XSCID. They will be&#xD;
      asked to discuss their decision and feelings about carrier testing.&#xD;

      This protocol studies carrier testing decisions of female adolescents who have a male&#xD;
      relative with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). XSCID is a rare&#xD;
      immunodeficiency that affects only males, although females carrying XSCID mutations can pass&#xD;
      the disease to their male offspring. In previous generations infant boys with XSCID uniformly&#xD;
      died, but medical interventions such as bone marrow transplantation and now gene therapy,&#xD;
      have proven life-saving for many patients. XSCID was mapped in 1987, and the disease gene was&#xD;
      identified in 1993; these advances made possible patient and carrier diagnosis, which have&#xD;
      been available on a research basis for 10 years through IRB-approved protocols of Dr. Puck. A&#xD;
      large sample of XSCID families enrolling in molecular diagnosis protocols participated in her&#xD;
      psychological study of the impact on adult siblings of having a brother affected with XSCID&#xD;
      (Protocol OH98-HG-N015, Perception of Carrier Status in Families with X-Linked Severe&#xD;
      Combined Immunodeficiency, now complete and terminated). That study indicated strong interest&#xD;
      on the part of at-risk females for carrier diagnosis before reaching the age of adulthood.&#xD;
      The current protocol is a follow-up protocol that functions in concert with Protocol&#xD;
      95-HG-0066 (Genetic Analysis of Immune Disorders) to study the decision-making process and&#xD;
      the impact of carrier testing in female adolescents from families with known XSCID mutations.&#xD;
      With parental consent, carrier testing for girls from age 13 through age 17 will be discussed&#xD;
      in a genetic counseling session. The 50% risk of being a carrier and the 50% chance of XSCID&#xD;
      in male offspring of carriers will be explained. Possible psychological and other benefits&#xD;
      and harms of testing will be aired. If elected by the girl, XSCID mutation testing will be&#xD;
      performed by having her enroll in our genetic testing protocol 95-HG-0066. Follow-up&#xD;
      interviews with all girls enrolled, both tested and not tested, will be conducted at 3 months&#xD;
      and a year post encounter.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only families who have solicited adolescent carrier testing will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mentally competent females from 13 through 17 years of age are eligible to enroll if they&#xD;
        have had a relative with XSCID proven by consistent medical history and mutation detection&#xD;
        in IL2RG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enrollees must be able to communicate in English (if a Spanish-speaking interviewer with&#xD;
        appropriate expertise in genetics and psychology is located, interview forms may be&#xD;
        translated so that subjects who speak Spanish can be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All ethnic groups are eligible.&#xD;
