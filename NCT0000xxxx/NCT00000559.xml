      To determine the effects, in postmenopausal women, of hormone replacement therapy on&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was a logical extension of preceding observational and cross-sectional studies on&#xD;
      estrogen replacement therapy. Overall, the studies suggested a 50 percent reduction in risk&#xD;
      of coronary heart disease in current estrogen users compared to non-users. In spite of such&#xD;
      striking findings, most studies had been prone to a number of biases. One major criticism of&#xD;
      observational studies had been that women receiving estrogen were generally healthier and&#xD;
      more compliant than non-estrogen users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was a very large body of observational data suggesting that the use of estrogen in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women reduced coronary heart disease mortality by approximately 45 percent. At&#xD;
      the same time, there had been some concern that replacement therapy increased the likelihood&#xD;
      of uterine cancer and perhaps breast cancer as well, although it was generally accepted that&#xD;
      this risk was probably significantly less than the benefits obtained from the reduction of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. After baseline angiograms, patients were&#xD;
      randomized to one of three arms: micronized 17-beta estradiol, 1 milligram per day; 17-beta&#xD;
      estradiol plus medroxyprogesterone, 5 milligrams per day for twelve days per month; and&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects in all three arms received lipid-lowering therapy, low fat/low cholesterol&#xD;
      diet, and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, in sufficient dosage to reduce low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below 130 mg/dl. The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      progression/regression of coronary obstructive disease as measured by angiography, including&#xD;
      the expert human panel and quantitative computer analysis. The secondary endpoint was carotid&#xD;
      media-intima thickness determined by ultrasound. Clinical measures included lipids,&#xD;
      lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, estradiol and medroxyprogesterone levels, urinary prostanoid&#xD;
      metabolites, and insulin/glucose metabolism. Subjects were recruited at three centers with&#xD;
      active coronary angiography units. Several core facilities supported the study: a Core Lipid&#xD;
      Lab, a Reproductive Endocrine Lab, the Biostatistics Lab (Data Coordinating Center) and the&#xD;
      Angiographic Imaging Laboratory.&#xD;
