  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the frequency of complete, marked, and partial clinical responses in patients&#xD;
      with cryptosporidiosis treated with 6 weeks of NTZ versus 21 days of placebo. To determine&#xD;
      the safety of NTZ in subjects with cryptosporidiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no proven therapy for cryptosporidiosis in persons with AIDS. Nitazoxanide appears&#xD;
      to be a good candidate drug for further evaluation because of its effectiveness in&#xD;
      preclinical models, the data from early clinical trials and its safety profile. Cooperation&#xD;
      between clinical researchers and basic scientists in clinical trials of agents for HIV&#xD;
      infection and its complications is a high priority for the ACTG, the NIAID, and the NIH.&#xD;
      Thus, it is important to design a clinical trial of NTZ that includes cooperation with basic&#xD;
      scientists.&#xD;

      to be a good candidate drug for further evaluation because of its effectiveness in&#xD;
      preclinical models, the data from early clinical trials and its safety profile. Cooperation&#xD;
      between clinical researchers and basic scientists in clinical trials of agents for HIV&#xD;
      infection and its complications is a high priority for the ACTG, the NIAID, and the NIH.&#xD;
      Thus, it is important to design a clinical trial of NTZ that includes cooperation with basic&#xD;
      scientists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to the active drug or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratified by presence or absence of dual infection with microsporidiosis and screening CD4+&#xD;
      count (&lt;= 50/mm3, &gt; 50/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 1 - 21, Arm I will receive oral NTZ and Arm II will receive NTZ placebo po bid&#xD;
      (blinded). With the approval of the protocol chair, patients may switch to open-label NTZ&#xD;
      after two weeks of blinded therapy if there is a clinical worsening of diarrhea due to&#xD;
      cryptosporidiosis accompanied by either weight loss &gt;= 5% or the requirement for intravenous&#xD;
      fluids to maintain body weight and/or intravascular volume despite the use of appropriate&#xD;
      antidiarrheal agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 22 - 42, Arm I and Arm II will receive oral NTZ (open-label). Days 43 - 63, Arm I will&#xD;
      begin the maintenance phase and Arm II will receive oral NTZ (open-label).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 63 Arm II will start the maintenance phase. In maintenance phase patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 doses of NTZ 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are not complete or marked responders at Day 42 (Arm I) or Day 63 (Arm II) may&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of NTZ for an additional three weeks. Patients who have a complete or&#xD;
      marked response at the higher dose may initiate maintenance therapy. Patients who continue to&#xD;
      have only a partial response or who fail to respond will discontinue therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Intestinal cryptosporidiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to undergo a 1 week washout phase of all anticryptosporidial medications&#xD;
             and stabilization on a protocol directed, antidiarrheal regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 4 stools per day, on average, for a minimum of 21 out of 28&#xD;
             days prior to study entry, secondary to cryptosporidiosis.&#xD;
