  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stuttering is an abnormality in speech that affects the rhythm of speech. People who stutter&#xD;
      know what they wish to say, but at the time are unable to say it because of involuntary&#xD;
      repetition, unnecessary lengthening (prolongation), or early stopping (cessation). This study&#xD;
      is designed to increase understanding of the genetic factors that may relate to stuttering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a protein found in the nucleus of all cells. It is responsible&#xD;
      for carrying the genetic information of the organism. DNA provides the directions for making&#xD;
      all of the substances in the human body. DNA can be linked together in small segments called&#xD;
      genes. Genes can contain information about anything related to an organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for researchers to determine what genes are directly related to stuttering they must&#xD;
      conduct several types of studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage studies, are studies of families that have a lot of members who stutter from several&#xD;
      generations. The linkage studies will be completed using adult individuals who are diagnosed&#xD;
      as persons who stutter and persons who have never stuttered, from one or more families with&#xD;
      large numbers of family members who have stuttered over several generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate gene studies, look closely at genes suspected to be related to stuttering in&#xD;
      patients who may or may not have a significant family history of stuttering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By conducting these studies, researchers hope to learn more about genes related to stuttering&#xD;
      and ultimately find out what causes stuttering.&#xD;

      Genetic studies in developmental stuttering are important for their potential in ultimately&#xD;
      determining pathophysiological basis of this disorder. This study will combine two approaches&#xD;
      to examine genetic aspects of stuttering, linkage in families, and candidate gene analysis.&#xD;
      Linkage studies will be completed using adult individuals who are diagnosed as persons who&#xD;
      stutter and those who can be judged as never having stuttered from one or more families with&#xD;
      large numbers of affected individuals within several generations. Candidate gene analyses&#xD;
      will also be carried out in adults who stutter to determine if the frequency of polymorphisms&#xD;
      for certain neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes differ from control populations. In&#xD;
      addition, given the heterogeneity of the population of adults who stutter, other phenotypic&#xD;
      probes such as motor skills, language skills, neuropsychological abilities and psychological&#xD;
      responses to stuttering will also be assessed in order to identify subgroups in which the&#xD;
      phenotype expression of the gene may differ.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be over the age of 5 and under the age of 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be in general good health, without evidence of chronic medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Onset of stuttering in affected individuals must have occurred in childhood (between 3 and&#xD;
        10 years of age), unrelated to psychological or neurological trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will not be tested for the presence of HIV antibodies. Persons with positive HIV&#xD;
        antibodies will not be excluded, unless they are taking medication which may change their&#xD;
        performance on tasks used for phenotypic assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be screened for history of psychiatric illness, such as depression, anxiety&#xD;
        or obsessive-compulsive disorders according to DSM-IV criteria. A history of these&#xD;
        disorders will not disqualify any subject from participation, but will be noted as a&#xD;
        variable in phenotypic assignment.&#xD;
