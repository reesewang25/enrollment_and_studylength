      To improve the predictive validity of Structured Interview assessments of Type A behavior by&#xD;
      comparing interviewer techniques in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) and&#xD;
      the Western Collaborative Group Study (WCGS). To assess whether there were interviewer&#xD;
      differences in the predictiveness of Type A behavior and its components for coronary heart&#xD;
      disease incidence in MRFIT and WCGS and if so, to assess whether the interviewer differences&#xD;
      in disease predictiveness were related to interviewer stylistics.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with Type A behavior are characterized as hard driving, competitive, and time&#xD;
      urgent; when asked questions they are quick to answer with emphatic speech; they perceive&#xD;
      themselves to be striving and competing and are prone to hostility. This core of behaviors is&#xD;
      presumed to be on a continuum of intensity with well-developed Type A's at the upper end and&#xD;
      well-developed Type B's at the lower end. Epidemiological studies have shown Type A's to have&#xD;
      a higher prevalence and incidence of various forms of coronary heart disease than Type B's.&#xD;
      The Structured Interview is a method of measuring Type A behavior in which a series of&#xD;
      questions are administered about the individual's characteristic responses to situations&#xD;
      relevant to the Type A behavior pattern, such as reaction to delay and reported frequency of&#xD;
      anger. The Interview is delivered in challenging style designed to elicit Type A&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1960, the WCGS recruited 3,154 employed men, ages 39 to 59, who were initially free of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease and followed them for 8.5 years for coronary heart disease incidence.&#xD;
      In 1972 MRFIT began recruiting 12,866 men, ages 35 to 57, selected for elevation of one or&#xD;
      more risk factors, but free from coronary heart disease and followed them for an average of&#xD;
      seven years after randomization to a risk factor modification group or to a control group&#xD;
      referred to their own physicians for treatment. Both studies used the Structured Interview to&#xD;
      assess Type A behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1981, Type A behavior was officially regarded as an independent risk factor for coronary&#xD;
      heart disease, based largely on the findings of the WCGS. However, the MRFIT did not find&#xD;
      Type A behavior to be related to coronary heart disease incidence. The manner of conducting&#xD;
      the Structured Interview may have affected the predictive reliability of the Type A&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviewer speech characteristics from the WCGS and MRFIT Structured Interview tape&#xD;
      recordings were audited and analyzed. Each speech characteristic was scored with high&#xD;
      reliability. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to control for standard risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
