  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a staged approach to therapy for&#xD;
      Wegener's granulomatosis and other systemic vasculitides using prednisone plus&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide followed by methotrexate. Vasculitides involve inflammation of blood vessels&#xD;
      (vasculitis) that may affect the brain, nerves, eyes, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, intestinal&#xD;
      tract, skin, joints, heart and other sites. Standard treatment with prednisone and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide is very effective, but has significant toxicity (adverse side effects).&#xD;
      Methotrexate is also an effective treatment and is less toxic, but it is associated with a&#xD;
      higher rate of disease recurrence and has not been used in patients with severe lung or&#xD;
      kidney disease. Staged therapy using cyclophosphamide first and then methotrexate may provide&#xD;
      better results for overall safety and effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 10 to 80 years of age with active Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa or&#xD;
      a related systemic vasculitis may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, chest X-ray,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG) and pulmonary function tests. Other procedures, such as biopsies,&#xD;
      will be done only as medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated initially with 1 milligram/kilogram body weight of prednisone&#xD;
      once a day and 2 to 4 mg/kg cyclophosphamide once a day. If the disease improves&#xD;
      significantly, prednisone will be gradually reduced and stopped, and if remission is&#xD;
      achieved, cyclophosphamide will be stopped. Methotrexate will then be started at 0.3 mg/kg&#xD;
      body weight once a week and then increased to 0.5 mg/kg after 2 to 4 weeks. Methotrexate&#xD;
      therapy will continue for at least 2 years. If at the end of 2 years the disease remains in&#xD;
      remission, the methotrexate will be gradually reduced and stopped. If, on the other hand,&#xD;
      active disease recurs during methotrexate treatment, the therapy will be changed. The new&#xD;
      choice of treatment will depend on the severity of recurrence, pre-existing medical&#xD;
      conditions, and previous adverse reactions to prednisone, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen periodically for a physical examination and blood tests to evaluate&#xD;
      disease activity, response to therapy and drug side effects. X-rays will be done as medically&#xD;
      indicated. Evaluations will be scheduled once a month until the patient has been on&#xD;
      methotrexate for 3 months and then every 3 months for the next 18 months. Patients whose&#xD;
      disease remains in remission at that time and are off all medications will be seen every 6&#xD;
      months for another 4 visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a staged treatment regimen&#xD;
      in Wegener's granulomatosis and related vasculitides in which patients will receive&#xD;
      glucocorticoid plus cyclophosphamide at disease onset; cyclophosphamide will be switched to&#xD;
      methotrexate upon disease remission. At the current time, cyclophosphamide plus&#xD;
      glucocorticoids are the standard of care for the treatment of these disorders. Although this&#xD;
      regimen has brought about a marked improvement in survival rate, it has been associated with&#xD;
      significant toxicity. Methotrexate plus glucocorticoids have recently been investigated in&#xD;
      patients with non life-threatening disease and while this regimen appears to have less&#xD;
      toxicity than standard therapy it may be associated with a higher rate of disease relapse. By&#xD;
      inducing patients with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids then switching to methotrexate at&#xD;
      remission, we hope to combine the efficacy of cyclophosphamide with the more favorable&#xD;
      toxicity profile of methotrexate. If successful, this regimen could provide a safer, yet&#xD;
      effective therapeutic option which would be applicable to all patients regardless of disease&#xD;
      severity. In this study, patients will be initially treated with cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      glucocorticoids and then switched from cyclophosphamide to methotrexate upon quiescence of&#xD;
      disease activity. If at the end of two full years of methotrexate therapy there is continued&#xD;
      evidence of disease remission, the drug will be tapered and ultimately discontinued. Patients&#xD;
      will be prospectively monitored for evidence of disease activity and drug toxicity. Specific&#xD;
      parameters that will be obtained include the time to disease remission, the rate and time of&#xD;
      disease relapse, and the incidence of drug related adverse effects. This study will be open&#xD;
      to patients with systemically active Wegener's granulomatosis or related vasculitis&#xD;
      regardless of their degree of disease severity.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Documentation of WG based on clinical characteristics and histopathological evidence of&#xD;
        vasculitis. Patients with a positive C- or P-ANCA and glomerulonephritis as evidence by the&#xD;
        presence of red blood cell casts and proteinuria or renal biopsy showing necrotizing&#xD;
        glomerulonephritis in the absence of positive immunofluorescence for immunoglobulin and&#xD;
        complement will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 10-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of active disease as defined by a Vasculitis Disease Activity Index of greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 3 or if begun on CTX and glucocorticoid at an outside institution, a&#xD;
        history of a Vasculitis Disease Activity Index greater than or equal to 3 at the time of&#xD;
        therapy initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of active systemic infection which, in the judgement of the investigator, is of&#xD;
        greater danger to the patient than the underlying vasculitis. In those instances in which&#xD;
        infection cannot be ruled out by gram stain and culture of secretions or collections of&#xD;
        fluid in involved organs, it may be necessary to obtain a biopsy of the affected tissue for&#xD;
        microbiological and histopathological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are pregnant or who are nursing infants will not be eligible. Fertile women&#xD;
        must have a negative pregnancy test within one week prior to study entry and must be using&#xD;
        an effective means of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Processes associated with an increased risk of MTX toxicity: acute or chronic liver&#xD;
        disease, past history of alcohol abuse (greater than 14 oz. of 100 proof liquor or&#xD;
        equivalent per week), ongoing alcohol use of any volume that cannot be discontinued upon&#xD;
        entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serological evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, or a&#xD;
        positive hepatitis B surface antigen. A serological determination will be performed within&#xD;
        two weeks of beginning study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to comply with study guidelines.&#xD;
