  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major improvements in the treatment of childhood non-lymphoblastic lymphomas have taken place&#xD;
      in the last ten years. Though the survival rate in low risk patients (i.e., those with stage&#xD;
      I &amp; II disease and serum LDH of less than 350 IU/dL) was as high as 90% with the previous&#xD;
      Pediatric Branch protocol, only 32% of patients in the high risk group achieved long term&#xD;
      remission. The present protocol is designed to improve survival in the high risk group by&#xD;
      using alternating non-cross resistant drug regimens. We plan to determine whether using&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in this group would increase&#xD;
      dose-intensity and ameliorate myelotoxicity. We also plan to study the effect on survival of&#xD;
      decreasing the duration of treatment to three months from the present year-long therapy in&#xD;
      low-risk patients.&#xD;

        High Risk Protocol: Patients with small non-cleaved (Burkitt or Burkitt-like) or diffuse&#xD;
        large cell lymphomas except those with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        a) Minimal extra-abdominal tumor as the sole site of disease and a serum LDH less than 1.5&#xD;
        times the upper limit of normal (NIH patients, less than 350 U/L) or except those with b)&#xD;
        completely resected small, localized abdominal mass (involved segmental lymph nodes&#xD;
        permitted) and a serum LDH level less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (NIH patients&#xD;
        less than 350 U/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients with small non-cleaved (Burkitt or Burkitt-like) or diffuse large cell&#xD;
        lymphomas with a serum LDH level greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (NIH&#xD;
        patients, greater than 350 U/L), regardless of the clinically documented extent of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients with small non-cleaved (Burkitt or Burkitt-like) or diffuse large cell&#xD;
        lymphomas with testicular involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Low risk protocol: Patients with small non-cleaved (Burkitt or Burkitt-like) or diffuse&#xD;
        large cell lymphomas with a) minimal extra-abdominal disease as the sole site of disease&#xD;
        and a serum LDH less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (NIH patients, less than 350&#xD;
        U/L) or b) completely resected small, localized abdominal mass (involved segmental lymph&#xD;
        nodes permitted for gastrointestinal disease) and a serum LDH level less than 1.5 times the&#xD;
        upper limit of normal (NIH patients, less than 350 U/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with lymphoblastic lymphomas, low grade or follicular lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with peripheral T cell lymphomas that do not fall into the category of&#xD;
        anaplastic large cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with a previously documented lymphoma or histological evidence of co-existing&#xD;
        lymphoma of other histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who have been previously treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients above the age of 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with a history of inherited or non-HIV acquired immunodeficiency syndromes.&#xD;
