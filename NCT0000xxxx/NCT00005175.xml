      To evaluate the relation between blood pressure and socioeconomic status, electrolyte intake,&#xD;
      obesity and psychosocial factors in Black and white students. Also, to compare blood&#xD;
      pressure, cardiovascular risk factors, sodium and potassium excretion in United States Blacks&#xD;
      with West African Blacks.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension related diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality among United States&#xD;
      Blacks. Among Blacks and whites, lower levels of education are associated with higher levels&#xD;
      of blood pressure, stroke, and coronary heart disease mortality. High levels of blood&#xD;
      pressure in United States Blacks compared to United States whites persist even after&#xD;
      controlling for education. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that individuals living in&#xD;
      the southeastern part of the United States continue to have higher stroke and coronary heart&#xD;
      disease mortality rates than those living in most other areas of the United States. The&#xD;
      number of upwardly mobile Blacks, based on education and occupation, has been increasing in&#xD;
      the United States yet relatively little is known about the relationships of improvements in&#xD;
      socioeconomic status and cardiovascular risk factors, particularly blood pressure. In Africa,&#xD;
      for over four decades, hypertension has been regarded as a rare disease among the Black&#xD;
      Africans. However, recent evidence from hospital and community based populations suggests&#xD;
      that hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease among Africans and constitutes&#xD;
      a major public health problem, particularly in West Africa. Furthermore, stroke is an&#xD;
      increasing health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this longitudinal study, the United States students were recruited and followed annually&#xD;
      for three years. The African students were followed for two years. At the initial clinic&#xD;
      visit blood pressure, heart rate and anthropometric measurements were obtained and&#xD;
      questionnaires completed concerning socioeconomic status, family and medical history, dietary&#xD;
      practices, and smoking and drinking habits. One out of every four students had blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements reassessed. Each participant collected an overnight urine sample for analysis of&#xD;
      sodium and potassium. Fifty percent of the population wore a physical activity monitor for&#xD;
      two days. Approximately ten percent of the students' families were studied to validate the&#xD;
      hypertensive status and medical history of the parent as reported by the students and to&#xD;
      assess known cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, smoking, alcohol intake, physical&#xD;
      activity, and behavioral factors. Univariate analyses were conducted to assess the&#xD;
      association between the dependent variable of blood pressure and each of the independent&#xD;
      variables including age, body mass index, height, sodium and potassium. T-tests were used to&#xD;
      analyze the dichotomous variables such as sex, race, and geographic location. Stratification&#xD;
      was used to examine blood pressure levels for Blacks and whites by socioeconomic status.&#xD;
      Multiple regression models were used to determine whether physiological or psychosocial&#xD;
      variables were more predictive of cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
