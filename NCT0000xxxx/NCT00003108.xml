      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin plus bryostatin 1 in treating&#xD;
      patients who have advanced cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of combination&#xD;
      bryostatin 1 and cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced, incurable solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. The first 4 cohorts of patients receive an&#xD;
      escalating dose of cisplatin with a fixed dose of bryostatin 1, followed by 5 cohorts&#xD;
      receiving an escalating dose of bryostatin 1 and a fixed dose of cisplatin. In the first&#xD;
      course, cisplatin is given as a 2 hour infusion followed by a 24 hour continuous infusion of&#xD;
      bryostatin 1. In all subsequent courses bryostatin 1 is given first and cisplatin afterwards.&#xD;
      Treatment continues every 21 days in patients with stable or responding disease. Dose&#xD;
      escalation proceeds until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination chemotherapy is&#xD;
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more patients&#xD;
      experience dose limiting toxicity. After the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients are&#xD;
      treated at this dose level. Patients are followed at 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
