  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a collaborative program of research on asthma and pregnancy consisting of two&#xD;
      studies: the Asthma in Pregnancy Study (APS) was an observational study to evaluate&#xD;
      relationships between asthma severity and treatment programs and perinatal outcome, and the&#xD;
      Asthma Therapy in Pregnancy Trial (ATPT) was a randomized clinical trial of inhaled&#xD;
      beclomethasone versus theophylline in the treatment of moderate asthma during pregnancy. Both&#xD;
      studies were conducted in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit (MFMU) Network, an ongoing group&#xD;
      of participating obstetric centers supported by the National Institute of Child Health and&#xD;
      Human Development. Studies were co-funded by the NHLBI.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is one of the most common illnesses that complicates pregnancy. Asthma complicates at&#xD;
      least 4 percent of all pregnancies; however, because at least 10 percent of the population&#xD;
      appears to have nonspecific airway hyper-responsiveness, the true prevalence may be much&#xD;
      higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma can produce serious maternal and fetal complications. A number of investigators have&#xD;
      reported an increased incidence of pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, hyperemesis&#xD;
      gravidarum, vaginal hemorrhage, toxemia, and induced and complicated labor. Fetal&#xD;
      complications include increased risk of perinatal mortality, prematurity, low birth weight,&#xD;
      and neonatal hypoxia. In contrast, several studies have failed to confirm some or all of&#xD;
      these previous observations. Patients with severe asthma may have the greatest risk for&#xD;
      complications during pregnancy, in addition to the risk of maternal morbidity from the&#xD;
      asthma. For example, it has been shown that reduced pulmonary function in asthmatic women is&#xD;
      associated with an increased likelihood of intrauterine growth retardation. On the other&#xD;
      hand, studies in which asthma was successfully controlled have resulted in pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
      similar to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms by which asthma may have adverse perinatal effects are not well known. Poor&#xD;
      control of asthma leading to chronic or episodic fetal hypoxia is thought to be important.&#xD;
      Medications used in asthma treatment may also play a role, although the limited data suggests&#xD;
      minimal or no effects. In addition, it is possible that extrapulmonary autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system abnormalities, such as uterine muscle hyperreactivity, could contribute to pre-term&#xD;
      delivery or gestational hypertension independent of asthma control or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, previous studies have been limited by relatively small numbers. Few studies&#xD;
      have controlled for factors known to affect infant birth weight, such as maternal race,&#xD;
      height, weight, parity, nutrition, and cigarette smoking. Particularly, race may be an&#xD;
      important contributing factor in assessing the relationship between asthma and pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes, since Blacks of both sexes are twice as likely to be hospitalized from asthma and&#xD;
      three times as likely to die from asthma as whites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the auspices of the National Asthma Education Program (NAEP), a Working Group on Asthma&#xD;
      and Pregnancy developed a statement regarding the treatment of asthma during pregnancy. In&#xD;
      its deliberations, the Working Group noted the paucity of data on the relative contributions&#xD;
      of biological, social, and environmental factors on asthma in pregnant women, as well as the&#xD;
      lack of data on the efficacy and safety of commonly used asthma therapies in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Asthma in Pregnancy Study evaluated the relationship between maternal asthma severity and&#xD;
      control. The primary objective was to determine the frequency of preterm delivery &lt;32 weeks&#xD;
      among moderate and severe asthmatics compared to non-asthmatic controls. The incidence of&#xD;
      small-for-gestational-age infants in women with mild and moderate asthma was a secondary&#xD;
      outcome. Other independent variables included type of medications used, race, socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, height, weight, parity, nutrition, smoking, other substance abuse, and prenatal care.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included birth weight and prematurity, maternal pre-eclampsia, gestational&#xD;
      hypertension, and asthma morbidity. The study began February 1,1995 and patient recruitment&#xD;
      continued for 46 months or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Asthma Therapy in Pregnancy Trial was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial which began recruitment in November, 1996, with enrollment lasting 44 months. Patients&#xD;
      were randomized to receive either active oral theophylline and a placebo beclomethasone&#xD;
      inhaler or an active beclomethasone inhaler and placebo oral theophylline. Albuterol was used&#xD;
      for relief of symptoms. The primary outcome measure was incidence of Emergency Department&#xD;
      visits or hospitalizations during pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures included birth&#xD;
      weight, incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants, gestational hypertension,&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia, lung function, daily peak flow, and quality of life. Patients were seen&#xD;
      monthly for measurements of fetal growth, morbidity, and lung function. Extensive interviews&#xD;
      were conducted with each patient at the first prenatal visit, in the third trimester, and&#xD;
      shortly before birth.&#xD;
