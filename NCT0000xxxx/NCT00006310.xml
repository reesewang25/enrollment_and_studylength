      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV8) is a blood-borne virus that is&#xD;
      etiologically associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma which is a&#xD;
      form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and a subset of multicentric Castleman's disease which is a&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder. The investigators developed serologic assays to measure&#xD;
      antibodies specific to KSHV latent and lytic antigens. Antibodies to KSHV antigens are found&#xD;
      in 70-100 percent of all clinical forms of KS patients. In contrast, relatively low&#xD;
      prevalence (2 to 5 percent) is found in the general population of North America.&#xD;
      Seroconversion is detected prior to KS onset in AIDS-KS patients, suggesting that primary&#xD;
      KSHV infection occurs predominantly in adulthood and is not ubiquitous. Antibody titers to&#xD;
      KSHV antigens remain elevated for years after seroconversion. The investigators have recently&#xD;
      found a 5 percent prevalence of KSHV infection in blood donors from San Antonio. Further,&#xD;
      KSHV has been found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of blood donors, and&#xD;
      organ transplantation and animal studies have provided evidence of likely person-to-person&#xD;
      transmission of KSHV. Thus, KSHV is a potential candidate for screening in blood and plasma&#xD;
      donors in view of its etiologic role for several malignancies, low but appreciable prevalence&#xD;
      in the general population, and lifelong persistence in a cross-sectional study in blood&#xD;
      donors from Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of KSHV infection in blood donors&#xD;
      using specific KSHV serologic assays. The investigators used recently developed KSHV specific&#xD;
      serologic assays for detecting antibody to KSHV latent nuclear antigen, lytic antigen, and&#xD;
      orf65 (lytic antigen minor capsid protein) to determine the prevalence of KSHV infection in a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study of four representative blood banks in San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston,&#xD;
      Texas. A total of 500 random donors at each site were studied to detect site-specific&#xD;
      seroprevalence to plus or minus 2 percent with 95 percent confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of the study was to analyze the demographic characteristics and the patterns&#xD;
      of other blood-borne infections of KSHV-seropositive blood donors. The cross-sectional study&#xD;
      in Houston and San Antonio was expanded to prospective study seroprevalence in a larger&#xD;
      population with questionnaire obtained demographic data to include gender, age, ethnicity,&#xD;
      education level, household income, and zip code. A total of 10,500 donors were obtained from&#xD;
      Houston. As the San Antonio center had the highest proportion of Hispanic donors, an&#xD;
      additional 2,000 donors were obtained and characterized demographically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim was to investigate KSHV molecular epidemiology in blood donors through sequence&#xD;
      determination of specific nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RT-PCR products from&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of KSHV-seropositive donors. The 2,000 blood&#xD;
      samples from San Antonio were also used to amplify KSHV sequences from peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells of KSHV positive donors using PCR, nested PCR and RT-PCR with and without&#xD;
      phorbol ester induction. Sequencing of amplified products was compared to KSHV isolates from&#xD;
      New York, Italy, England, and Africa for phylogenetic analysis and assessment of diversity&#xD;
      and distribution of KSHV strains in Texas. While the proposed sampling represented only one&#xD;
      center in Texas, comparison to isolates for New York and abroad allowed determination of the&#xD;
      likelihood that Texas strains were unique or imported from Europe or Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This regional project was performed in collaboration with the University Health System Donor&#xD;
      Center in San Antonio, BloodCare in Dallas, and Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center in Houston,&#xD;
      thus providing results for three separate metropolitan areas with rather different ethnic&#xD;
      compositions. These studies should provide valuable information to assess the necessity and&#xD;
      feasibility of national screening of blood donors for KSHV, and gain insight into the&#xD;
      patterns of infection as well as the diversity, the distribution, and the origins of the&#xD;
      virus strains in blood donors.&#xD;
