  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of topically applied SP-303T in AIDS patients. To&#xD;
      observe the effect of this drug on herpes simplex virus lesions in patients who have failed&#xD;
      to heal in response to oral or intravenous acyclovir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of alternative treatments for herpes simplex virus infection in patients with AIDS&#xD;
      and the development of resistance to acyclovir for patients requiring repeated treatment&#xD;
      presents a therapeutic dilemma for physicians. SP-303T has good in vitro activity against&#xD;
      resistant strains and offers a convenient and inexpensive means of drug administration in&#xD;
      comparison to the use of intravenous medication.&#xD;

      The lack of alternative treatments for herpes simplex virus infection in patients with AIDS&#xD;
      and the development of resistance to acyclovir for patients requiring repeated treatment&#xD;
      presents a therapeutic dilemma for physicians. SP-303T has good in vitro activity against&#xD;
      resistant strains and offers a convenient and inexpensive means of drug administration in&#xD;
      comparison to the use of intravenous medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 14 days (and up to 42 days) of treatment with topically applied SP-303T.&#xD;
      SP-303T is applied directly onto herpes simplex virus lesions three times daily in a quantity&#xD;
      sufficient to thinly cover the entire lesion, which may then be covered with an appropriate&#xD;
      dressing, if needed. At the end of the treatment period, patients enter a follow-up period of&#xD;
      2 weeks.&#xD;
