  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving HIV-positive patients an HIV vaccine plus&#xD;
      anti-HIV drugs can help lower HIV levels in the blood (viral load).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the time of study entry, all patients are receiving a HAART regimen consisting of three&#xD;
      drugs from at least two classes of antiretroviral drugs. Upon entering the study, patients&#xD;
      receive Remune or IFA at Weeks 0, 12, and 24. Patients remain on study for 40 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      who have received three injections of Remune or IFA and whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level is less&#xD;
      than 50 copies/ml at Week 26 discontinue HAART at Week 28. (If the patient has a plasma HIV-1&#xD;
      RNA level at or above 50 copies/ml at Week 26, he/she must have a measurement below 50&#xD;
      copies/ml at Week 27 to proceed with HAART discontinuation at Week 28. If by Week 27 the&#xD;
      patient does not have a plasma HIV-1 RNA level below 50 copies/ml, the patient does not&#xD;
      discontinue HAART but remains on study and has study visits at Weeks 34 and 40.) Patients who&#xD;
      discontinue HAART have their plasma HIV-1 RNA levels measured on the day HAART is&#xD;
      discontinued and at Days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 after discontinuation. Patients&#xD;
      with a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of at least 5,000 copies/ml at Week 34 restart HAART at that&#xD;
      time. (Patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level reaches greater than or equal to 100,000&#xD;
      copies/ml on two occasions before Week 34 have the option of restarting HAART immediately.)&#xD;
      Patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level is less than 5,000 copies/ml at Week 34 do not restart&#xD;
      HAART unless their level increases to at least 5,000 copies/ml. Patients who discontinue&#xD;
      HAART are monitored intensively for the duration of the study. Patients have 27 visits if&#xD;
      they stay on study until completion at Week 40.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are receiving an anti-HIV drug combination that contains three drugs from at least two&#xD;
             classes of anti-HIV drugs (such as protease inhibitors). Patients must have been&#xD;
             receiving this drug combination for at least 6 months before study entry. Before&#xD;
             beginning this drug combination, patients must have taken either no anti-HIV drugs or&#xD;
             only one or two nucleoside analogues (NRTIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a viral load between 5,000 and 100,000 copies/ml before beginning their current&#xD;
             anti-HIV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load below 50 copies/ml while on their current anti-HIV therapy within 2&#xD;
             weeks before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a CD4 count greater than 350 cells/mm3 at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at least 13 years old (consent of parent or guardian required if under 18).&#xD;
