  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the antibiotic gentamicin for treating patients with muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy caused by a specific genetic abnormality known as a nonsense mutation. In studies&#xD;
      of mice with this type of muscular dystrophy, gentamicin treatment produced positive changes&#xD;
      in muscle tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy caused by nonsense mutations by may be&#xD;
      eligible for this 2-week study. Before starting treatment, patients will have evaluations of&#xD;
      muscle strength and general well being. Two muscle tissue samples will be taken by needle&#xD;
      biopsy, under local anesthetic and sedation. Because of potential risks of hearing loss and&#xD;
      kidney toxicity associated with gentamicin, patients will also have a hearing test and blood&#xD;
      and urine tests for kidney function before starting treatment. (Currently, gentamicin is&#xD;
      commonly prescribed for serious infections of the lungs, heart, and digestive and urinary&#xD;
      tracts; adverse effects of hearing loss and kidney toxicity can occur with excessively high&#xD;
      drug doses.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized during drug treatment. Gentamicin will be given intravenously&#xD;
      (through a vein) once a day for 14 days. Blood samples will be collected daily to monitor&#xD;
      drug levels and determine dosage adjustments, if necessary. Urine samples will be collected&#xD;
      to assess kidney function. Hearing tests will be done on days 7 and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the last day of the study, hearing, kidney function, and muscle strength will be tested&#xD;
      and the results compared with pre-treatment levels. Blood and muscle samples will also be&#xD;
      taken again for pre-treatment comparison. Hearing, blood, urine, and muscle strength tests&#xD;
      will be repeated one month after treatment ends for comparison with previous results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal disease of progressive muscular weakness for&#xD;
      which there is currently no effective treatment. The disease is caused by mutations in the&#xD;
      gene for dystrophin. A subset of these mutations includes nonsense mutations, i.e., premature&#xD;
      stop codons. Previous studies have shown that aminoglycosides are effective in allowing&#xD;
      translation through stop codons. Recently, gentamicin was shown to restore functional&#xD;
      dystrophin in a mouse model of DMD. The objective of this protocol is to determine if&#xD;
      gentamicin is also an effective treatment in patients with DMD caused by nonsense mutations.&#xD;
      This will be a preliminary, non-blinded study in which levels of intravenous gentamicin&#xD;
      previously established to be safe, will be administered to identified patients meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria over a two-week period. These patients will have CLIA approved laboratory&#xD;
      documented stop codon mutations in the dystrophin gene. Quantitative dystrophin expression&#xD;
      will be the primary outcome. Strength measurements will also be assessed before and&#xD;
      immediately after the two-week treatment period. Follow-up evaluations will be made at one&#xD;
      month. For this subset of patients with DMD it is anticipated that there will be a transient&#xD;
      increase in dystrophin expression with a possible corresponding transient improvement in&#xD;
      strength. Subsequent blinded studies to evaluate the most effective dose and dosing intervals&#xD;
      would then be pursued.&#xD;
