      To measure by gas-liquid chromatography the relative concentrations of all saturated and&#xD;
      unsaturated fatty acids found in the cholesterol ester and phospholipid fractions of plasma&#xD;
      from 4,000 subjects participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.&#xD;
      The data were used to clarify the role of various fatty acids in atherosclerosis.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ARIC study is a large population-based, prospective, multicenter study supported by NHLBI&#xD;
      which began in 1986, and is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors. It involves investigation of four cohorts,&#xD;
      each with 4,000 adults ages 45 to 65 from four different communities. The study conducts&#xD;
      surveillance for hospitalized myocardial infarction, fatal cardiovascular disease, and stroke&#xD;
      in its cohorts and of the community from which they are drawn. Events are classified by a&#xD;
      Morbidity and Mortality Classification Committee using standardized criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected on the ARIC cohort at baseline included: a clinical history, a physical&#xD;
      examination including blood pressure, height, weight, and anthropometry. A second history and&#xD;
      physical examination were performed after three years, and annual telephone interviews were&#xD;
      conducted in the intervening years. Laboratory studies at baseline and at three years&#xD;
      included: electrocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, ultrasonographic examination of both&#xD;
      carotids and one popliteal artery for direct visualization of the atherosclerotic process in&#xD;
      peripheral large vessels, and numerous blood studies. Certain hemostatic and lipid tests were&#xD;
      performed only in 'cases' with ultrasonographically determined carotid atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      matched normal 'controls.'&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ARIC clinical history did collect some dietary history using the Willett Questionnaire,&#xD;
      and asked a few questions regarding fish consumption. However, specific questions were brief&#xD;
      and only semi-quantitative. Direct measurement of plasma fatty acid content as an ancillary&#xD;
      study in the Minnesota cohort of the ARIC study gave far more objective information on&#xD;
      specific fatty acid consumption and was invaluable in sorting out the true role that various&#xD;
      fatty acids play in the prevention of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, measurement of&#xD;
      plasma fatty acids in Minnesota ARIC subjects allowed investigation of the relationships&#xD;
      between plasma fatty acids composition and the vast amount of laboratory and clinical outcome&#xD;
      data which the ARIC study collected. Because the clinical and other laboratory data for each&#xD;
      ARIC participant were already available in the computerized data base, a tremendous amount of&#xD;
      valuable information was derived on plasma fatty acid relationships with laboratory findings&#xD;
      and clinical outcome in a large, randomly selected United States population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies were ancillary to the ARIC study. A cross-sectional study examined the&#xD;
      association of plasma fatty acids with plasma lipids, hemostatic parameters, and blood&#xD;
      pressure. A nested case-control study examined the association of plasma fatty acids in 75&#xD;
      Minnesota cases with carotid atherosclerosis versus 75 normal matched controls. A third study&#xD;
      examined the association of plasma fatty acids with incident clinical cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      namely myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
