      To examine the role of dietary sodium reduction with and without potassium supplementation in&#xD;
      controlling blood pressure in hypertensive men.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriately increased interest and concern about high blood pressure as a major public&#xD;
      health problem coincided with the indication that the risks of hypertension-related morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality could be reduced by reduction of blood pressure. Consensus suggestions that&#xD;
      individualized approaches be used in treating patients with mild hypertension stimulated&#xD;
      further investigations of non-pharmacological methods. Such investigations were also of&#xD;
      considerable interest in relation to understanding the physiology of blood pressure control&#xD;
      as well as the development of less costly non-drug therapies. Interest was heightened by&#xD;
      information suggesting that there might be distinctly harmful side effects related to&#xD;
      antihypertensive drug therapy, particularly thiazide diuretics, in some settings. Studies of&#xD;
      non-drug therapies included dietary modifications primarily involving weight reduction and&#xD;
      sodium restriction with increasing recent concern about other factors such as alcohol intake,&#xD;
      dietary fat, calcium, magnesium, and potassium intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind. One hundred forty-five subjects were randomized into a low sodium&#xD;
      placebo group in which sodium intake was restricted to no more than 80 mEq/day, 142 subjects&#xD;
      into a potassium supplementation (96 mEq/day) group whose sodium intake was also restricted&#xD;
      to no more than 80 mEq/day. After 12 weeks of intervention, antihypertensive drugs were&#xD;
      withdrawn. Follow-up of each participant was for at least two years. The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      the proportion of subjects requiring antihypertensive medication at various points following&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
