  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what dose of the drug cidofovir is safe to treat&#xD;
      laryngeal papillomatosis (warts in the throat which occur over and over) in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laryngeal papillomatosis is caused by infection with a virus called human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV). At present, there is no approved drug to treat this infection. However, cidofovir is a&#xD;
      drug effective against several viruses. Cidofovir may be able to attack the HPV virus. This&#xD;
      study tests the safety of giving this drug to children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Your child will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive either cidofovir or&#xD;
      placebo (an inactive substance). Neither you nor your doctor will know which your child is&#xD;
      receiving. Your child will undergo a total of 6 bronchoscopic procedures, which involves&#xD;
      placing a tube down your child's throat so that the warts can be seen and treated. The warts&#xD;
      will be removed by laser or other procedures and the study drug injected. Study drug will be&#xD;
      injected at the sites of all newly removed warts and warts which were removed during earlier&#xD;
      study visits. This procedure will be performed every other week. Blood and urine tests will&#xD;
      also be performed at this time. Your child will be under general anesthesia during each&#xD;
      procedure and will be in the surgery unit for about 6 to 8 hours. Your child will also have&#xD;
      to be seen by the doctor 2 days after the procedure. Your child will be followed for a total&#xD;
      of 5 years to make sure he/she develops normally and to monitor any side effects of&#xD;
      cidofovir. Follow-up visits will take place at Months 3, 6, and then once every 6 months&#xD;
      through Year 5. If necessary, laser or other procedures will be performed at these visits to&#xD;
      remove any warts.&#xD;
