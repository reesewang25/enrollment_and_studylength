  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of the HIV vaccine Remune on viral load&#xD;
      (level of HIV in the blood) and on the way the immune system responds to HIV. This study will&#xD;
      also try to see if the effects of the vaccine are different in patients entering the study&#xD;
      with a viral load below 50 copies/ml compared to those who have a viral load from 50 to 500&#xD;
      copies/ml. (This study is currently being redesigned and the purpose may be revised.)&#xD;
      Treatment with anti-HIV drugs does not always keep HIV viral load undetectable (so low that&#xD;
      it cannot be measured). This study originally added an HIV vaccine called Remune to treat&#xD;
      patients. Remune was thought to reduce viral load and improve immune responses. However, new&#xD;
      information suggests that Remune may not be as effective as was first believed. The study has&#xD;
      been changed to follow people already in the study and to let people enroll only if they&#xD;
      participate in the substudy. The substudy will look at the effect of another HIV vaccine,&#xD;
      vCP1452, on the immune response and how it works in combination with Remune. Information&#xD;
      about the safety of these vaccines in HIV-positive patients will be gathered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that inactivated, gp120-depleted whole virus immunogen (Remune) boosts&#xD;
      immune responses to HIV. One response, lymphocyte proliferative response (LPR) to p24, is&#xD;
      correlated with a low viral load in some patients with long-term non-progression of disease.&#xD;
      This study examines whether administering Remune vaccine may generate new immune responses or&#xD;
      boost existing responses to keep the level of virus in the blood low for a longer period of&#xD;
      time than antiretroviral therapy alone. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/20/00: In a recent study using&#xD;
      Remune, comparison of virologic failure and time to virologic failure between Remune and&#xD;
      adjuvant placebo arms revealed no differences between the 2 arms of the study. Results of&#xD;
      this study suggest that the hypothesis in A5057 (that recipients of Remune would have only 50&#xD;
      percent of the number of virologic relapses as occur in the control arm) is no longer&#xD;
      plausible in its current design. This protocol is being redesigned.] A substudy adds the HIV&#xD;
      canarypox vaccine (vCP1452) in patients in the parent study and evaluates whether canarypox&#xD;
      vaccine can augment the immune responses of Remune.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will add either Remune (Arm A), or the placebo Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (Arm B),&#xD;
      to their antiretroviral therapy. They will be stratified to 1 of the following 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients suppressed with 3 or more antiretroviral drugs for 15 months or longer, with an&#xD;
           HIV-1 RNA below 50 copies/ml, and who may have substituted 1 antiretroviral medication&#xD;
           during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients suppressed with 3 or more antiretroviral drugs, who have not taken&#xD;
           antiretroviral medications for 15 months or longer, with an HIV-1 RNA below 50&#xD;
           copies/ml, and who may have substituted 1 antiretroviral medication during that time.&#xD;
           [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/20/00: This stratum includes patients who have taken their current&#xD;
           antiretroviral therapy for less than 15 months prior to screening viral load&#xD;
           measurement. If these patients changed from prior antiretroviral regimen(s) during the&#xD;
           15 months prior to screening, they must have changed at least 2 antiretroviral drugs&#xD;
           during this time.]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients suppressed with 3 or more antiretroviral drugs and whose HIV-1 RNA is 50&#xD;
           copies/ml or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients suppressed with 2 antiretroviral drugs. Injections of either Remune or IFA are&#xD;
           given at Day 1 and once every 12 weeks for 96 weeks. Patients remain at the clinic for&#xD;
           observation for 30 minutes following the first and second injections. If a patient's HIV&#xD;
           viral level rises above a certain level, the patient and his/her health care provider&#xD;
           may decide to change antiretroviral drugs to try and lower it. Injections will be&#xD;
           suspended until the lower level is achieved, then resumed on the regular 12-week&#xD;
           schedule. If the decision is not to change therapy, or the viral load does not decrease&#xD;
           to under 500 copies/ml within 3 to 4 months, injections may still be received as long as&#xD;
           the HIV RNA level is below 5,000 copies/ml. Blood samples are collected prior to every&#xD;
           injection to determine CD4/CD8 counts and viral load, to assay for viral presence in&#xD;
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and to store for future studies. Pregnancy tests for&#xD;
           women of reproductive potential, physical exams, and medical histories are done prior to&#xD;
           every immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An immunological substudy will randomize 80 of the eligible volunteers from the study cohort&#xD;
      to additionally receive ALVAC vCP1452 or placebo (ALVAC) with equal probability. Arm A will&#xD;
      receive ALVAC vCP1452; Arm B will be administered placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/20/00: The study is closed to accrual except for patients who enroll into&#xD;
      A5058s until the protocol can be redesigned. Patients enrolled under Version 1.0 continue to&#xD;
      be followed every 12 weeks (plus or minus 14 days) until the end of the study. Patients&#xD;
      should continue taking the same potent antiretroviral treatment that they were taking at&#xD;
      study entry until reaching the primary endpoint of first virologic relapse.]&#xD;
