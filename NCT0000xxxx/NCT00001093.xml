  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if it is effective to give aggressive anti-HIV&#xD;
      therapy to patients who have been infected recently with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many doctors recommend that patients who have recently been infected with HIV begin anti-HIV&#xD;
      treatment as soon as possible. However, early HIV infection is not yet completely understood,&#xD;
      so it is not known if this is the best approach. This study will look at the effects of&#xD;
      beginning anti-HIV treatment during early HIV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many researchers have recommended initiation of aggressive antiretroviral therapy as&#xD;
      soon as possible after HIV infection occurs, the tolerability and efficacy of this approach&#xD;
      has not been systemically evaluated. Many features of primary HIV pathogenesis are&#xD;
      incompletely understood. A more complete understanding of immune dynamics and viral&#xD;
      pathogenesis during primary HIV infection is critical to determine optimal treatment&#xD;
      intervention strategies. This study will evaluate the outcomes of potent antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy initiated at different stages of primary HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six of the study patients are coenrolled to ACTG 371 or another treatment protocol.&#xD;
      All study drug treatment and toxicity management is performed according to guidelines in&#xD;
      these treatment protocols. An untreated cohort of 12 patients is also followed on this study.&#xD;
      Patients are stratified at enrollment according to their stage of acute or early HIV&#xD;
      infection. Patients are evaluated for virologic, immunologic, and clinical parameters for 96&#xD;
      weeks. In addition, novel studies of source partner identification are proposed. An effort is&#xD;
      made to determine the most likely source partner(s) for each study patient on the basis of&#xD;
      patient recall of possible exposures. A separate study protocol will evaluate the source&#xD;
      partner.&#xD;
