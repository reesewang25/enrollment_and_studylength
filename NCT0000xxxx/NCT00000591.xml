      To determine if a reduction in morbidity and mortality from acute and chronic graft versus&#xD;
      host disease (GvHD) can be achieved through use of T-cell depletion techniques without a&#xD;
      counterbalancing increase in relapse of leukemia in patients receiving an unrelated donor&#xD;
      marrow transplant.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is an accepted therapeutic option for many&#xD;
      hematologic, immunologic, and malignant diseases, including chronic myelocytic leukemia and&#xD;
      acute leukemia during or after first relapse (second remission). In order to maximize the&#xD;
      chance for a successful transplant, it is desirable that the donor and the recipient share&#xD;
      the same Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) histocompatibility antigens. Because of the Mendelian&#xD;
      inheritance of HLA antigens, the chances of finding a match are much greater among relatives&#xD;
      than in the general population. However, only about 30 percent of patients needing a&#xD;
      transplant have a matched sibling. Thus a transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor may&#xD;
      be an important alternative for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft versus host disease is a frequent and severe complication of marrow transplantation.&#xD;
      Acute GvHD typically occurs within three months after transplantation and is characterized by&#xD;
      skin rash, liver dysfunction, and diarrhea. Although the pathophysiology of this disease is&#xD;
      not fully defined in humans, data from animal studies suggest that it is mediated by mature&#xD;
      donor T cells that react against disparate recipient histocompatibility antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One treatment modality that ameliorates or prevents GvHD following allogeneic marrow&#xD;
      transplantation is T cell-depletion of donor marrow before infusion into the recipient. T&#xD;
      cell-depletion can be divided into physical methods such as separation by elutriation or&#xD;
      sheep cell rosetting, and immunologic methods which use a T cell-specific antibody(ies) plus&#xD;
      complement or toxin to kill the cells. These different techniques may remove a subpopulation&#xD;
      of T cells, all T cells, or T cells plus other cell types such as B cells or natural killer&#xD;
      (NK) cells. The number of stem cells transferred may also be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, in many of the published studies conducted in patients receiving transplants&#xD;
      from HLA-matched siblings, T cell-depletion used to prevent or treat GvHD increased the&#xD;
      chances of other complications, namely graft failure and leukemia relapse. This is not&#xD;
      surprising in light of studies of patients with both early and advanced leukemias that&#xD;
      demonstrated a decreased risk of relapse associated with acute and/or chronic GvHD. Because&#xD;
      the net effect of these opposing consequences of T cell-depletion on leukemia-free survival&#xD;
      in related donor transplants is generally unfavorable, T cell-depletion for related donor&#xD;
      marrow transplantation is controversial. The utility of T-cell depletion in unrelated-donor&#xD;
      transplants needs to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiative grew out of increasing concern on the part of Institute staff, the bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation community, and members of Congress that graft versus host disease is so&#xD;
      frequent and severe a complication of unrelated donor transplants that it has become a&#xD;
      limiting factor in their outcome. The initiative was given concept clearance by the May 1992&#xD;
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council and released in January 1993.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this trial was disease free survival at three years post transplant.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints included overall survival, incidence of GvHD, graft failure, infections&#xD;
      and other complications, and time to disease relapse. The covariates considered included age&#xD;
      of recipient, disease risk status, interval between diagnosis and transplant, disease type,&#xD;
      age and gender of donor, post-transplant chimerism, pre-transplant Karnofsky score, and other&#xD;
      measures of performance status. An economic analysis was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a T-cell depleted or a non-depleted&#xD;
      transplant. Two methods of T-cell depletion were in use: an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      T10B9, plus complement, or counterflow elutriation plus the Ceprate column. Each method of&#xD;
      T-depletion was part of a package that included a specific pre-transplant conditioning&#xD;
      regimen and additional GvHD prophylaxis. Patients randomized to the non-T-cell depleted arm&#xD;
      received a conditioning regimen containing cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, and a&#xD;
      GvHD prophylaxis regimen of cyclosporin and methotrexate. A total of 410 patients were&#xD;
      enrolled. Enrollment ended October 31, 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 14 transplant centers participated in the study, Follow-up ended in April 2002.&#xD;
