  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective it is to give multi-drug treatment&#xD;
      with indinavir (IDV) plus ritonavir (RTV) plus enteric-coated didanosine (ddI) plus stavudine&#xD;
      (d4T) and if there are differences in responses between men and women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients are enrolled in balanced numbers based on gender and stratified by viral load (less&#xD;
      than or equal to 10,000, 10,000 to 100,000, or more than 100,000 copies/ml). Prior to&#xD;
      therapy, a peer-based patient education intervention is presented. Patients receive a&#xD;
      combination of IDV, RTV, enteric-coated ddI, and d4T. Responses to this multi-agent&#xD;
      antiretroviral drug regimen are explored based on sex differences. A pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      sub-study, balanced so that half of patients are male and half are female, is performed on&#xD;
      IDV and RTV for 20 to 25 of the patients. About 20 females are examined for study-drug&#xD;
      effects on gonadotropic hormone levels.&#xD;
