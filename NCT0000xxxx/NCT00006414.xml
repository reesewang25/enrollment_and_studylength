  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of an experimental treatment to improve hand&#xD;
      function in patients who have had a stroke affecting one side of the body. One of the main&#xD;
      problems of stroke patients is difficulty using the affected hand. Most treatments focus on&#xD;
      acute (early) intervention, although special exercises may help some chronic patients.&#xD;
      Previous studies have indicated that combining hand exercises with anesthesia (blocking motor&#xD;
      and sensory function) of the upper arm may improve hand movement in stroke patients, even in&#xD;
      the chronic state. This study will examine whether the exercise plus anesthesia treatment is&#xD;
      more beneficial for these patients over the long-term than exercise alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years or older who are at least 12 months post stroke, which has affected only&#xD;
      one side of the body, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history&#xD;
      and physical and neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into two groups: one will practice hand exercises&#xD;
      without upper arm anesthesia and the other will exercise with anesthesia. All patients will&#xD;
      perform two consecutive sessions of 30-minute pinch practice-forceful pinching of the thumb&#xD;
      and index finger. Patients in the anesthesia group will have the anesthetic injected in the&#xD;
      lower neck. Enough anesthetic will be administered to block motor and sensory function in the&#xD;
      shoulder and upper arm, while maintaining as much function as possible in the forearm and&#xD;
      hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will also have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) testing. For this&#xD;
      procedure, a very brief electrical current is passed through an insulated wire coil placed on&#xD;
      the head, producing a magnetic pulse. The pulse travels through the scalp and skull and&#xD;
      causes small electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. During the study, the&#xD;
      patient will be asked to make movements, do simple tasks, or tense muscles, while the&#xD;
      electrical activity of the muscles is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have four sessions at 3-week intervals and three follow-up sessions at 3 weeks,&#xD;
      9 weeks and 24 weeks after the testing. Follow-up evaluations will include pinch power&#xD;
      testing, TMS, sensory function test and hand function measurement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to enhance our understanding of the effect of regional&#xD;
      anesthesia of the proximal arm paired with practice on motor recovery after stroke. We plan&#xD;
      to determine; 1) if regional anesthesia of the proximal arm (above the elbow level) paired&#xD;
      with practice in chronic disabled stroke patients enhances an improvement of the hand motor&#xD;
      function in addition to motor power; 2) if further enhancement of motor improvement can be&#xD;
      achieved by repetitive trials of this intervention; and 3) how long this effect lasts.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Twelve hemispheric patients (right or left) with residual arm function who had a single&#xD;
        monohemispheric stroke (documented by CT or MRI) at least 12 months before, without severe&#xD;
        proprioceptive deficits, independent of previous physical therapy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They should all be able to perform the training task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded from the study will be: patients with more than one stroke;&#xD;
&#xD;
        patients with large cortical, cerebellar or brainstem lesions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients unable to extend metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints at least 10-20 degrees;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients unable to extend the wrist at least 20 degrees;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with substantially recovered motor function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with severe depression, poor motivational capacity, or severe language&#xD;
        disturbances, particularly of receptive nature;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with severe spasticity/pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with bilateral motor problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with serious cognitive deficits (defined as equivalent to a mini-mental state exam&#xD;
        score of 20 or less);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients severe uncontrolled medical problems (e.g. cardiovascular disease, severe&#xD;
        rheumatoid arthritis, active joint deformity of arthritic origin, active cancer or renal&#xD;
        disease, any kind of end-stage pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, or a deteriorated&#xD;
        condition due to age, uncontrolled epilepsy or others);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with respiratory failure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with friable plaques (class D disease) or a stenosis exceeding 70% in the internal&#xD;
        carotid artery ipsilateral to the side of paresis (as assessed with ultrasonography).&#xD;
