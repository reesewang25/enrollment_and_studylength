  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to learn more about the natural history of inherited neurological&#xD;
      disorders and the role of heredity in their development. It will examine the genetics,&#xD;
      symptoms, disease progression, treatment, and psychological and behavioral impact of diseases&#xD;
      in the following categories: hereditary peripheral neuropathies; hereditary myopathies;&#xD;
      muscular dystrophies; hereditary motor neuron disorders; mitochondrial myopathies; hereditary&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders; inherited neurological disorders without known diagnosis; and&#xD;
      others. Many of these diseases, which affect the brain, spinal cord, muscles, and nerves, are&#xD;
      rare and poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults of all ages with various inherited neurological disorders may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participants will undergo a detailed medical and family history, and a family&#xD;
      tree will be drawn. They will also have a physical and neurological examination that may&#xD;
      include blood test and urine tests, an EEG (brain wave recordings), psychological tests, and&#xD;
      speech and language and rehabilitation evaluations. A blood sample or skin biopsy may be&#xD;
      taken for genetic testing. Depending on the individual patient s symptoms, imaging tests such&#xD;
      as X-rays, CT or MRI scans and muscle and nerve testing may also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from this study may provide a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings&#xD;
      of these disorders, contributing to improved diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling,&#xD;
      and perhaps leading to additional studies in these areas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Neurogenetics Branch (NGB) within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and&#xD;
      Stroke (NINDS) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide genetic diagnosis to&#xD;
      participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this protocol is to provide a resource of participants for&#xD;
      enrollment into new research protocols throughout the NGB and other NIH laboratories.&#xD;
      Evaluating and diagnosing participants will allow the NGB specialists to maintain their&#xD;
      expertise and gain additional knowledge of the course of various neurological disorders. The&#xD;
      information obtained will allow for the evaluation and diagnosis of the studied neurological&#xD;
      diseases. This understanding may lead to ideas for future protocols. In some cases, blood or&#xD;
      other biologic samples (including urine, saliva, or a cheek (buccal) swab) will be obtained&#xD;
      for future laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants to be enrolled will be set to 3,500 participants with neurological&#xD;
      diseases and their unaffected relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational diagnostic study of multiple neurological diseases and their&#xD;
      pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No formal outcomes will be measured; however the clinical assessments of enrolled&#xD;
      participants can be used to characterize the disease manifestations. In addition, DNA samples&#xD;
      obtained may be used to identify and verify causative mutations as well as identify novel&#xD;
      genes, which may help establish pathogenic mechanisms and genotype-phenotype correlations.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Participants include those with inherited neurological conditions based on the&#xD;
             training and research needs of the Neurogenetics Branch program. There is no logical&#xD;
             limit; however the total number of participants that can be enrolled in the protocol&#xD;
             will be restricted. No more than 3,500 participants with either diagnosed or&#xD;
             undiagnosed neurological conditions and their unaffected relatives will be enrolled in&#xD;
             this evaluation and diagnostic protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be eligible if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have either a known or suspected, inherited neurological disease, OR are an unaffected&#xD;
             relative (first-, second-, third, or higher degree relative) of a participant with a&#xD;
             genetic neurological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent or have a parent/legal&#xD;
             guardian to do so if they are minor children or a legal guardian to provide consent&#xD;
             for adults without consent capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 2 years and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will not be eligible if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Have a systemic disease that compromises the ability to provide adequate neurologic&#xD;
        examination or diagnosis.An example of this would be a contagious disease that would&#xD;
        compromise our ability to do an adequate neurological exam.&#xD;
