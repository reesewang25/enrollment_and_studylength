  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the long-term effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in combination with&#xD;
      anti-HIV drugs, or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to see if IL-2 can increase the number of CD4 cells (cells of the immune system which fight&#xD;
      infection) in HIV-infected patients who have completed ACTG 328.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAART is often successful in decreasing viral load (level of HIV in the blood), but these&#xD;
      drugs have not been able to restore the immune systems of HIV-infected patients. IL-2 is a&#xD;
      substance naturally produced by the body's immune cells. In ACTG 328, IL-2 is tested to see&#xD;
      if it can increase the number of CD4 cells and &quot;boost&quot; a patient's immune system. This study&#xD;
      is a follow-up to ACTG 328 so that patients who are benefiting from IL-2 can continue to take&#xD;
      it and patients in the control group who do not receive IL-2 can start taking it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV disease is characterized by a progressive decline in CD4 cells and an increase in viral&#xD;
      burden. Although antiretroviral therapy has been successful in controlling viral levels, its&#xD;
      effects on CD4 cell counts have been modest. Intermittently administered IL-2 in the presence&#xD;
      of HAART has been shown to increase CD4 cell counts, decrease lymphocyte activation markers,&#xD;
      and increase certain lymphocyte functional activity in patients with early-stage HIV&#xD;
      infection. ACTG 328 evaluated the effects of intravenous and/or subcutaneously administered&#xD;
      IL-2 in conjunction with HAART in a group of more advanced HIV-infected patients over an 18-&#xD;
      to 22-month period. As patients were enrolled in this study over an 18-month period, a&#xD;
      follow-up protocol is required to provide continued IL-2 therapy for patients responding to&#xD;
      IL-2 and patients in the control group who wish to receive this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study enrolls patients who participated in ACTG 328. Patients in Arm I of ACTG 328 (the&#xD;
      control group receiving HAART only) who have a viral load of 5,000 copies/ml or less register&#xD;
      for Step II. Patients in Step II receive subcutaneous [SC] IL-2 in combination with HAART.&#xD;
      IL-2 is administered for 5 days every 8 weeks for the first 3 cycles. For subsequent cycles,&#xD;
      the interval between cycles may be extended in 8-week increments for a maximum of 24 weeks,&#xD;
      provided the patient's bimonthly CD4 count exceeds 500 cells/mm3. Patients in Arm I who have&#xD;
      a viral load greater than 5,000 copies/ml register for Step I which requires a change in&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy. Patients who then achieve viral levels of 5,000 copies/ml or less may&#xD;
      begin to receive IL-2 no earlier than 4 weeks and no later than 12 weeks after the change in&#xD;
      HAART regimen. Patients whose viral load remains above 5,000 copies/ml for 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      change in drug regimen are discontinued from the study. Patients in Arms II or III of ACTG&#xD;
      328 (IL-2-containing arms) who have had a 25 percent or greater increase in CD4 cell count&#xD;
      above their Week 11 value and have a viral load of 5,000 copies/ml or less continue on SC&#xD;
      IL-2 and HAART. Patients who meet the CD4 criteria but whose viral load is above 5,000&#xD;
      copies/ml change their HAART regimen. After a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks,&#xD;
      these patients may receive IL-2 provided they have a viral load of 5,000 copies/ml or less.&#xD;
      For this study, HAART is defined as one protease inhibitor and two nucleoside analogues. [AS&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99: All patients must receive a protease inhibitor or, with permission of&#xD;
      the chair, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus either two nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or another protease inhibitor or NNRTI.] The&#xD;
      protease inhibitor provided on this study is indinavir (IDV). The nucleoside analogue&#xD;
      combinations provided on this study are as follows: zidovudine (ZDV) plus didanosine (ddI),&#xD;
      ZDV plus lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC, or d4T plus ddI. Other antiretroviral&#xD;
      drugs may be used but are not provided by this study. Patients are monitored for CD4 counts&#xD;
      at bimonthly intervals after the first IL-2 dose. CD4 counts and plasma storage for HIV RNA&#xD;
      are done within 96 hours prior to each cycle of IL-2. Safety laboratory evaluations are&#xD;
      obtained prior to and at the conclusion of each IL-2 course. TSH (thyroid-stimulating&#xD;
      hormone), DTH skin testing, and real-time plasma HIV RNA are obtained at 6-month intervals.&#xD;
