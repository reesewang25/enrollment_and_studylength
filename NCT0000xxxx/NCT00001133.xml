  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the protease inhibitors indinavir (IDV) and ritonavir (RTV) will be studied in&#xD;
      patients who have high levels of virus while taking other protease inhibitors. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to see how the body takes in, distributes, and gets rid of IDV and RTV. This&#xD;
      study will also look at any side effects that IDV or RTV causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDV is an effective anti-HIV drug, but it can be difficult for patients to take. For IDV to&#xD;
      work against HIV, it must be taken 3 times a day at a high dose and with a certain diet.&#xD;
      Doctors believe IDV may be easier to take if it is given with RTV. Patients who take IDV and&#xD;
      RTV together may be able to take IDV only twice a day and at a lower dose. This study will&#xD;
      gather information about the safety and side effects of using IDV and RTV together.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IDV, a protease inhibitor, has shown excellent clinical and virologic responses when combined&#xD;
      with 2 nucleoside analogues. Although effective, the pharmacokinetics of IDV make it&#xD;
      difficult to use in many patients. The drug has a short half-life and requires administration&#xD;
      in high doses every 8 hours with significant dietary restrictions. Research has shown that&#xD;
      IDV kinetics can be improved significantly by the addition of RTV, allowing for&#xD;
      administration of IDV at lower doses every 12 hours. The half-life of IDV is prolonged 3- to&#xD;
      5-fold when administered with RTV. Based on these results, it is reasonable to study this&#xD;
      combination as a twice-daily dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of IDV/RTV for 24 weeks (Arms A and B). All&#xD;
      patients also receive 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The NRTIs are&#xD;
      not provided by the study. Clinical assessments take place at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,&#xD;
      and 24 which includes a virology assessment. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/21/00: Patients who&#xD;
      experience a confirmed virologic failure (defined in protocol) and elect to remain on study&#xD;
      treatment, are followed through Week 24. Patients who experience a confirmed virologic&#xD;
      failure and elect to discontinue study treatment will have a final evaluation at the time of&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation.] Patients are hospitalized for 12 hours at the Week 2 study visit&#xD;
      for an intensive pharmacokinetic analysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load (level of HIV in the blood) of at least 500 copies/ml but no more&#xD;
             than 100,000 copies/ml within 45 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been taking the following anti-HIV drug combination for at least 12 weeks before&#xD;
             study entry: 2 NRTIs plus amprenavir (APV), nelfinavir (NFV), saquinavir (SQV), or NFV&#xD;
             plus SQV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are naive to at least 1 NRTI. This means that there is at least 1 NRTI that the&#xD;
             patient has not taken for more than 14 days. In the case of lamivudine (3TC), naive&#xD;
             means that the patient has never taken this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are willing and able to drink 1.5 liters (a little over 1.5 quarts) of water or other&#xD;
             fluids a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control (such as condoms) during the&#xD;
             study and for 3 months after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken protease inhibitors other than APV, NFV, SQV, or NFV plus SQV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are resistant to the effects of IDV or RTV, as shown by a blood test. (Patients whose&#xD;
             viral load is between 500 and 1,000 copies/ml will not need to be tested.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any active opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection in the 14 days before study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any medical condition or history of disease that would prevent them from&#xD;
             completing the study or put them at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have cancer that requires chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active infection that requires treatment in the 14 days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a fever for a week or more in the 30 days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the 30 days&#xD;
             before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received a vaccine in the 21 days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received an experimental drug or a drug that affects the immune system in the 30&#xD;
             days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken or plan to take certain other medications that may affect the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
