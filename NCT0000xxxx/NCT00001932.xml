      Patients in this study will undergo PET scans (a type of nuclear imaging test) to look for&#xD;
      abnormalities in certain brain proteins associated with seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animals have shown that serotonin-a chemical messenger produced by the&#xD;
      body-attaches to proteins on brain cells called 5HT1A receptors and changes them in some way&#xD;
      that may help control seizures. There is little information on these changes, however. A new&#xD;
      compound that is highly sensitive to 5HT1A, will be used in PET imaging to measure the level&#xD;
      of activity of these receptors and try to detect abnormalities. Changes in receptor activity&#xD;
      may help determine where in the brain the seizures are originating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional PET scans will be done to measure the amount of blood flow to the brain and the&#xD;
      rate at which the brain uses glucose-a sugar that is the brain's main fuel. Blood flow&#xD;
      measurement is used to calculate the distribution of serotonin receptors, and glucose use&#xD;
      helps determine how seizures affect brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gained from the study will be used to try to help guide the patient's therapy&#xD;
      and determine if surgery might be beneficial in controlling the patient's seizures.&#xD;

      Objective: to study serotonin receptors in patients with localization-related epilepsy.&#xD;
      Studies in experimental animals have suggested that: Serotonin is an anticonvulsant&#xD;
      neurotransmitter in a number of seizure models; its anticonvulsant action is mediated by&#xD;
      activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors; drugs with antiepileptic effects may release 5HT or block&#xD;
      reuptake, and these mechanisms appear to be related to their therapeutic effect. 5HT(1A)&#xD;
      receptors are abundant in regions such as entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal&#xD;
      neocortex, where epileptogenic zones are frequently found. Considerable evidence from&#xD;
      literature indicates that alterations in 5-HT(1A) receptors exist in experimental models of&#xD;
      both generalized and complex partial seizures. There is little data on changes in 5-HT&#xD;
      receptors in epileptic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 75 patients with localization-related epilepsy and 20 normal controls, aged&#xD;
      18-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Using a new PET compound which is a highly selective 5-HT(1A) silent antagonist&#xD;
      referred to as (18)FCWAY, we will attempt to detect abnormalities in serotonin receptors in&#xD;
      vivo in patients with epilepsy. The patients will have (18)FCWAY serotonin receptor studies&#xD;
      (which include (15)H2O-CBF PET) and high resolution T1-weighted MRI for co-registration.&#xD;
      (18)FDG-PET will be performed in the patients as part of seizure focus localization. We will&#xD;
      also test subjects for the serotonin transporter polymorphism associated with depression, and&#xD;
      perform a standard depression battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: 5HT-1A receptor binding and Glucose metabolism measured by PET.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have clinically documented partial seizures with consistent EEG evidence as&#xD;
        defined by the 1981 International Classification of Epileptic Seizures, refractory to&#xD;
        standard antiepileptic treatment for at least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be in age ranges of 18 to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be male or female. Female patients of child bearing potential will have a&#xD;
        pregnancy test prior to each PET scan to ensure that pregnant patients will not participate&#xD;
        in the study. During the study, woman of child bearing potential must use a reliable method&#xD;
        of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Three groups of patients will be scanned:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  50 patients with EEG and clinical evidence for mesial temporal onset with either MRI&#xD;
             findings of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) or dysplasia or normal MRI studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  25 patients with apparent neocortical seizure foci.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, patients will be screened for the presence of depression in addition to&#xD;
        epilepsy; at least 15 patients from groups 1 and 2 who currently meet DSM-IV criteria for&#xD;
        the category &quot;Mood disorder due to epilepsy&quot; (293.83), and the subtype &quot;with major&#xD;
        Depressive-Like Episode&quot; 296.2 Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, or 296.3 Major&#xD;
        Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, indicating that subjects meet diagnostic criteria for a&#xD;
        major depressive episode. DSM diagnoses will be based on the Research Version of the&#xD;
        Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) including the&#xD;
        detailed assessment of the course of both epilepsy and depressive symptoms as well as the&#xD;
        family history of medical and psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Twenty healthy normal adults will be included. Controls will be screened in the NINDS&#xD;
        Clinical Epilepsy Section outpatient clinic, with physical examination, CBC urinalysis and&#xD;
        blood chemistries. Controls with chronic illnesses, taking any medications, or who smoke&#xD;
        will be excluded. They will be asked to abstain from alcohol for one week before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients younger than 18 or older than 60 years old will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a known treatable seizure etiology such as neoplastic or infectious disease&#xD;
        will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, trauma or AVMs will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with progressive neurologic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of significant medical disorders, or requiring chronic treatment&#xD;
        with other drugs which can not be stopped, except for SSRIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients not capable of giving an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who had seizure activity 24 hours prior to the study.&#xD;
