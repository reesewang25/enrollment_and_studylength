      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that fat patterning is an important risk factor for diabetes and possibly&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. The Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health in 1985&#xD;
      concluded that diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were among the six causes of death that&#xD;
      contribute most to the disparity in death rates between Blacks and whites, yet the&#xD;
      relationship of fat patterning with these diseases was largely unstudied in Blacks. Since&#xD;
      there are known racial differences in growth rates, body proportions, and adiposity, it&#xD;
      cannot be assumed that studies done on whites are applicable to Blacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Charleston Heart Study began in 1960 with the examination of a random sample of 2181&#xD;
      residents of Charleston County. Approximately one-third of the sample was Black. The cohort&#xD;
      was re-examined in 1963-1964, 1974-1975, and 1984-1985, and the fifth recall involving&#xD;
      physical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiograph, plasma glucose and lipid assays,&#xD;
      physical disability assessment, and 24-hour Holter monitoring was completed. In the 1963-1964&#xD;
      recall, 102 high socioeconomic status Black men were added to the cohort. Also, in the&#xD;
      1963-1964 recall a battery of anthropometric measurements were taken on about half the cohort&#xD;
      and these measurements and others were included in the 1987-1988 recall. Thus height, weight,&#xD;
      reported weight at age 25, circumference of the chest at inhale and exhale, circumference at&#xD;
      the umbilicus and mid-arm circumference were available on the same individuals from the&#xD;
      1963-1964 and the 1987-1988 examinations. In addition, skinfolds at the triceps, biceps,&#xD;
      subscapular, suprailiac and lower thigh and circumference at the hips were measured in the&#xD;
      latter recall. The fifth examination was completed in 1989 under separate NHLBI grant&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional relationships were estimated between anthropometric measures of body&#xD;
      dimensions such as abdominal, central and upper body fat patterning, and total adiposity and&#xD;
      the dependent variables of diabetes, blood pressure, plasma lipids and glucose, and left&#xD;
      ventricular wall thickness. Anthropometric predictors of diabetes, blood pressure, plasma&#xD;
      lipids and glucose, and left ventricular wall thickness were identified over a 24 year&#xD;
      interval. Anthropometric predictors of survival were identified over a 25 year period with&#xD;
      reference to mortality for coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. Body dimensions were described by race and sex groups and changes in the shapes of&#xD;
      individuals over a 24 year interval were examined. The importance of changes in&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements with aging was determined for the prediction of diabetes, blood&#xD;
      pressure, plasma lipids and glucose, left ventricular wall thickness, mortality from all&#xD;
      causes and from coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
