  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human heart is divided into four chambers. One of the four chambers, the left ventricle,&#xD;
      is the chamber mainly responsible for pumping blood out of the heart into circulation.&#xD;
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetically inherited disease causing an abnormal&#xD;
      thickening of the heart muscle, especially the muscle making up the left ventricle. When the&#xD;
      left ventricle becomes abnormally large it is called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This&#xD;
      condition can cause symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and heart beat&#xD;
      palpitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to compare the ability of two drugs (enalapril and losartan) to&#xD;
      improve symptoms and heart function of patients diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      (HCM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have decided to compare these drugs because each one has been used to treat&#xD;
      patients with other diseases causing thickening of the heart muscle. In these other&#xD;
      conditions, enalapril and losartan have improved symptoms, decreased the thickness of heart&#xD;
      muscle, improved blood flow and supply to the heart muscle, and improved the pumping action&#xD;
      of the heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers will compare the effectiveness of enalapril and losartan when given&#xD;
      separately and together to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiac disease characterized by left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. There is often associated LV diastolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia. The severity of the LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia are important determinants of clinical outcomes. Angiotensin II modulates&#xD;
      cell growth and cardiac function. There is also increasing evidence that the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be present in cardiac cells, and the hypertrophic action&#xD;
      of angiotensin II could therefore be mediated by circulating or locally produced hormone.&#xD;
      Animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that independent of their effects on systemic&#xD;
      blood pressure, ACE inhibition and angiotensin II receptor (AT1) blockade can reduce cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy, improve LV diastolic function and myocardial ischemia. AT1 blockade may be&#xD;
      preferable to ACE inhibitors because by inhibiting angiotensin II from binding to its&#xD;
      receptor, the system can be turned off irrespective of the source of angiotensin II. Also,&#xD;
      there may be fewer side effects due to lack of bradykinin. This is a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study that examines the abilities of enalapril (ACE inhibition) and&#xD;
      losartan (AT1 blockade), separately or in combination, to cause regression of the cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy, and to improve LV function and myocardial perfusion in non-obstructive HCM.&#xD;
