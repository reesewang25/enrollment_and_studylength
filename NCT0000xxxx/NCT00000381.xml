      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to use fluoxetine to treat&#xD;
      children and adolescents with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety disorders are one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children and&#xD;
      adolescents, and can cause disturbances in the child's school, social, and family lives.&#xD;
      Having an anxiety disorder puts a child at risk for depression and drug abuse, and appears to&#xD;
      continue into adulthood. There is very little information on anxiety medications for&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive either fluoxetine or an&#xD;
      inactive placebo for 12 weeks. Each child will be monitored for symptoms and side effects&#xD;
      throughout the study. He/she will have blood tests at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 to measure drug&#xD;
      levels in the blood. The study will last for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child is eligible for this study if he/she:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is 8 to 17 years old and has anxiety disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child will not be eligible for this study if he/she:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Has current major depression, panic disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, or abuses&#xD;
      alcohol or drugs.&#xD;

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fluoxetine as a treatment for children and adolescents&#xD;
      with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety disorders are among the most common childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      and are often associated with academic, social, and family morbidity. These disorders&#xD;
      frequently increase the risk for developing other psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression,&#xD;
      substance abuse), aggregate in families, and appear to continue into adulthood. Except for&#xD;
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, there are very few pharmacological treatment studies for&#xD;
      childhood anxiety disorders. Given the sparsity and methodological problems of previous&#xD;
      anxiety pharmacological studies, it is clear that further investigation of the use of&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment of children and adolescents with these disorders is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to receive either fixed-dose fluoxetine or placebo for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients are assessed for psychiatric symptomatology, functional status, and side effects. In&#xD;
      addition, to assess attainment of steady state and compliance with treatment, plasma levels&#xD;
      of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine are measured at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. To standardize the&#xD;
      treatment protocol and to assure that both groups (fluoxetine and placebo) receive equivalent&#xD;
      nonpharmacological treatment, a manual is used. Potential predictors of clinical response&#xD;
      (such as age, sex, duration and severity of anxiety, school absenteeism, sub-syndromal&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, family history of anxiety or mood disorders) are explored.&#xD;
