  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This studied is designed to discover the genes that cause hearing impairment. More precisely,&#xD;
      this study aims to map and clone genes that are important for the development and maintenance&#xD;
      of the anatomy and physiology related to hearing (auditory system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin by finding large families who have members with hearing impairment. Once&#xD;
      families are found, members with and without hearing impairment will be evaluated by an&#xD;
      audiologist and a clinician (doctor). An audiologist, is a person trained in evaluating,&#xD;
      habilitating, and rehabilitating people with disorders of hearing function. The clinician's&#xD;
      responsibility is to examine the patients and check for other signs and symptoms related to&#xD;
      hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finding the gene for hearing impairment requires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt;TAB&gt;DNA samples of hearing impaired family members, taken from standard blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &lt;TAB&gt;DNA samples of members of the family without hearing impairment, taken from&#xD;
           standard blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &lt;TAB&gt;Results of hearing tests conducted by the audiologist for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all members of the family are evaluated researchers can create a pedigree. A pedigree is&#xD;
      like a family tree that charts members of a family with a genetic disorder, like hearing&#xD;
      impairment. Pedigrees are used to determine the mode of inheritance of the gene responsible&#xD;
      for a particular condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, researcher intend on using all the information gathered as well as methods for&#xD;
      genetic analysis to map out the location of the gene. Patients participating in this study&#xD;
      will not directly benefit from its research, but scientific understanding achieved may help&#xD;
      researchers better understand the auditory system and someday prevent deafness.&lt;TAB&gt;...&#xD;

      The objective of this research project is to map and clone genes that are important for the&#xD;
      normal development or maintenance of the auditory system. One strategy for identifying some&#xD;
      of the genes important for auditory processes is to ascertain large families each with&#xD;
      several hearing impaired individuals. Initial contact will be made by family physicians,&#xD;
      audiologist, supervisors in schools for the hearing impaired, and directly by the principal&#xD;
      investigators during surveys of schools for the deaf and visits with hearing impairment&#xD;
      self-help groups. Members of a family will be evaluated by an audiologist, and instances of&#xD;
      hearing impairment will be documented and categorized. A clinician would then examine hearing&#xD;
      impaired and unaffected members of the family for the presence of other clinical features so&#xD;
      as to distinguish between nonsyndromic and syndromic forms of hearing impairment. Pedigrees&#xD;
      of these families will be analyzed to determine the mode of inheritance of the hereditary&#xD;
      hearing impairment segregating in each family. Families will be ascertained through&#xD;
      audiologists and other clinicians, genetics clinics, schools for the hearing impaired and&#xD;
      through linguists and medical anthropologists who study unique sign languages and the&#xD;
      sociology of communities with a high proportion of hearing impaired individuals. The mutated&#xD;
      gene will then be genetically mapped by a linkage or association based strategy, using DNA&#xD;
      typing of highly polymorphic genetic markers distributed across the human genome.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is anticipated that, in most cases, patients will be recruited whose disorders do not&#xD;
        appear to be syndromic (i.e. are not associated with extra-auditory or extra-vestibular&#xD;
        features).&#xD;
&#xD;
        We seek subjects who are members of large families with multiple individuals affected with&#xD;
        a hearing disorder. Sporadic cases will occasionally be included when the phenotype has&#xD;
        features suggestive of mutations in one or a few particular candidate genes, since&#xD;
        autosomal or X-linked recessive inheritance can appear to be sporadic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If there is evidence of genetic homogeneity, small families can be pooled for linkage&#xD;
        analysis, or a combination of large and small families can be pooled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects of any ethnic background, gender, age, sexual orientation, or health status will&#xD;
        be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded when their hearing or vestibular dysfunction are known to be&#xD;
        caused by a nongenetic etiology such as trauma, infection, metabolic or immunologic&#xD;
        disorders, or exposure to ototoxic agents such as noise or aminoglycoside antibiotics.&#xD;
