  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most chronic (long-lasting) wounds of the leg (also known as venous ulcers) fail to heal in a&#xD;
      reasonable period of time. Although researchers have made great progress in understanding how&#xD;
      the body repairs wounds, attempts to develop new treatments have been disappointing. In&#xD;
      general, treatments based on recent findings about the details of wound repair have not&#xD;
      greatly reduced the number of people who have chronic wounds. The long-term goal of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate a new approach for healing a chronic wound. Current methods of directly&#xD;
      applying substances that are involved in wound healing to a chronic wound do not cause enough&#xD;
      healing. PDGF-B (platelet-derived growth factor B), a factor associated with wound healing,&#xD;
      might dramatically enhance healing if a genetically engineered virus is injected into the&#xD;
      wound that causes cells in the wound to produce PDGF-B in large quantities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most chronic wounds of the leg fail to heal in a reasonable period of time. In fact, despite&#xD;
      considerable advances in elucidating the molecular basis of wound repair, attempts to develop&#xD;
      new therapies have been disappointing. In general, therapies based on recently elucidated&#xD;
      mechanisms of wound repair have had minimal effect on the overall number of individuals with&#xD;
      a treated healed chronic wound. The long-term goal of this study is to evaluate a new&#xD;
      approach for healing a chronic wound. Current methods of applying cytokines as a topical&#xD;
      protein to treat chronic wounds result in an inadequate response. PDGF-B, a growth factor&#xD;
      associated with wound healing, might dramatically enhance wound healing when produced in&#xD;
      large quantities in the wound bed via adenovirus-mediated gene overexpression by the cells of&#xD;
      the wound bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two trials. The goal of Trial A, a dose-escalation trial, is to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PDGF-B/Ad5, an adenovirus vector designed to&#xD;
      overexpress PDGF-B, with respect to local and systemic toxicity and biologic feasibility. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to evaluate the acute safety, both local and systemic, of an intra-ulcer&#xD;
      injection of PDGF-B/Ad5, thereby determining the recommended dose. Upon evaluating patients,&#xD;
      they will be treated with a single intra-ulcer injection of PDGF-B/Ad5 in the wound. Patients&#xD;
      will receive only one dose, which will be administered during a 72-hour inpatient stay in a&#xD;
      research unit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a standard three-six dose-escalation scheme. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      highest dose for which fewer than two of six subjects experience a severe adverse reaction.&#xD;
      Each patient will be closely monitored for clinical adverse reactions resulting from&#xD;
      treatment with PDGF-B/Ad5. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Trial B is to evaluate the safety and biologic feasibility of the&#xD;
      MTD of PDGF-B/Ad5 reported in Trial A in a standard 24-week trial for treatment of a venous&#xD;
      leg ulcer. For this study, 15 consecutive patients will be treated using the MTD. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a single intra-ulcer injection of PDGF-B/Ad5 and a limb compression&#xD;
      bandage to be changed weekly.Study participants will be followed for 24 weeks, which is the&#xD;
      length of most FDA-approved venous leg ulcer trials.&#xD;
