      Stage III patients may begin therapy prior to or following surgery. Patients with undrainable&#xD;
      significant third space fluid collection (e.g., pleural effusions, ascites) are entered&#xD;
      directly on Consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive induction chemotherapy with methotrexate and fluorouracil every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      4 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients then receive two 3-week courses of consolidation therapy with cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      followed by daily granulocyte colony-stimulating factor until completion of leukapheresis.&#xD;
      Patients next receive myeloablative doses of thiotepa followed by stem cell rescue and&#xD;
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hematopoietic reconstitution, patients receive 24-hour infusions of paclitaxel every 3&#xD;
      weeks for 4 doses, followed by doxorubicin or vinblastine every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Patients&#xD;
      are then evaluated for additional therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy) as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months.&#xD;

      This pilot trial will examine the feasibility of administering induction high-dose therapy&#xD;
      with antimetabolites, followed with consolidation using high-dose single alkylating agent&#xD;
      therapy and finally intensification therapy with sequential cycles of very high doses of the&#xD;
      natural products (paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin) to patients with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer (stage IV), and to patients with lesser stage disease at high risk for relapse&#xD;
      (patients with four or more positive nodes (stage II), locally advanced breast cancer (stage&#xD;
      III)), and patients with locally or regionally recurrent breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive induction therapy with antimetabolite agents (methotrexate, leucovorin&#xD;
      and 5-fluorouracil) for four cycles. Patients will then receive consolidation therapy with&#xD;
      three cycles of high-dose alkylating agents. First, patients will receive one cycle of&#xD;
      high-dose cyclophosphamide administered with growth factor support. PBPCs will be harvested&#xD;
      during the recovery phase of the cyclophosphamide cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next cycle will consist of high-dose single agent thiotepa. Hematopoietic stem cells&#xD;
      mobilized and collected during the previous cyclophosphamide cycles will be reinfused&#xD;
      following treatment with thiotepa to augment recovery of bone marrow function. After&#xD;
      recovery, intensification with natural product chemotherapy will be administered, consisting&#xD;
      of four cycles of paclitaxel given as a 24-hour infusion followed by four cycles of single&#xD;
      agent doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol combines several highly active chemotherapeutic agents in an attempt to improve&#xD;
      upon response rates achieved with current combinations. For high-risk stage II and III&#xD;
      patients, this chemotherapy regimen (without genetic manipulation of PBPCs) will serve as a&#xD;
      chemotherapy backbone onto which a companion immunotherapy protocol will be offered. An&#xD;
      identical chemotherapy regimen will be offered to stage four patients as a backbone for a&#xD;
      trial of retroviral transduction of the MDR1 and NeoR genes into harvested PBPCs.&#xD;
