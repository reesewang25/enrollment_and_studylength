  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of various combinations of anti-HIV&#xD;
      drugs in HIV-positive men and women. Patients receive specific combinations of 3 or 4 of the&#xD;
      following 6 drugs: didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T) efavirenz (EFV), nelfinavir (NFV),&#xD;
      lamivudine (3TC), or zidovudine (ZDV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-HIV therapy is effective in preventing the spread of HIV in the body. However, patients&#xD;
      often experience unpleasant side effects and have difficulties following the dosing schedule.&#xD;
      This study looks for combinations of anti-HIV drugs (&quot;cocktails&quot;) which will be the most&#xD;
      effective with the fewest problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy, though effective in the suppression of HIV&#xD;
      proliferation, is often complicated by difficulties with adherence and drug toxicity. Various&#xD;
      combinations of highly active antiretroviral therapy exist; all have proved efficacious in&#xD;
      related trials. The question addressed in this trial is which combination of antiretroviral&#xD;
      &quot;cocktails&quot; provides the single greatest advantage in preventing the spread of HIV in the&#xD;
      body. In effect, which therapy provides the greatest benefit with the fewest complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), efavirenz (EFV), and nelfinavir (NFV) placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: ddI, d4T, EFV placebo, and NFV. Arm C: lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV), EFV, and NFV&#xD;
      placebo. Arm D: 3TC/ZDV, EFV placebo, and NFV. Arm E: ddI, d4T, EFV, and NFV. Arm F: 3TC/ZDV,&#xD;
      EFV, and NFV. Patients with virologic failure on 2 successive measurements or study-drug&#xD;
      intolerance discontinue their randomized study therapy and proceed to Step 2. [AS PER&#xD;
      AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients must switch regimens as soon as possible after confirmation of&#xD;
      virologic failure to prevent development of drug resistance.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Patients receive treatment as in Arm D of Step 1. Arm B: Patients receive treatment as&#xD;
      in Arm C of Step 1. Arm C: Patients receive treatment as in Arm B of Step 1. Arm D: Patients&#xD;
      receive treatment as in Arm A of Step 1. Arms A, B, C, and D: Patients who fail Step 2&#xD;
      treatment proceed to Step 3. Arms E and F: Patients with virologic failure on Step 1 proceed&#xD;
      immediately to Step 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3 (salvage therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A, B, C, and D: Patients receive indinavir (IDV), amprenavir (APV), ddI, and hydroxyurea&#xD;
      (HU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.&#xD;
      Regimen 1 consists of IDV, ritonavir (RTV), ddI, and HU. Regimen 2 consists of APV, RTV, ddI,&#xD;
      and HU. Regimen 3 consists of IDV, RTV, abacavir (ABC), and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 4 consists of&#xD;
      APV, RTV, ABC, and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 5 consists of IDV, RTV, ABC, d4T, and 3TC. Regimen 6&#xD;
      consists of APV, RTV, ABC, d4T, and 3TC.] Arm E: Patients receive IDV, APV, and 3TC/ZDV. [AS&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 7 or 8. Regimen 7 consists of&#xD;
      IDV, RTV, and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 8 consists of APV, RTV, and 3TC/ZDV.] Arm F: Patients receive&#xD;
      IDV, APV, ddI, and d4T. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 9&#xD;
      or 10. Regimen 9 consists of IDV, RTV, ddI, and d4T. Regimen 10 consists of APV, RTV, ddI,&#xD;
      and d4T.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients already enrolled in Step 3 before site&#xD;
      registration to Version 4.0 of this protocol have the option of receiving 1 of the&#xD;
      appropriate new Step 3 regimens as outlined above or staying on their originally assigned&#xD;
      Step 3 therapy.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/21/01: If virologic failure on Step 1 or 2 is confirmed,&#xD;
      then HIV-1 RNA genotype resistance testing (in real-time, if possible) is performed. Patients&#xD;
      receive 1 of the Step 3 drug regimens based on the results of the resistance testing.]&#xD;
      Patients may co-enroll in metabolic, pharmacologic, immunologic, or adherence substudies.&#xD;
