  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in blood donors who test positive&#xD;
      for antibodies to this virus. Most HCV-infected people do not become ill and are not aware&#xD;
      that they have hepatitis or have had it in the past. Some infected people recover completely,&#xD;
      whereas others remain chronically infected. The study will try to define infectivity of&#xD;
      anti-HCV positive individuals, routes of transmission of the virus, and the number of&#xD;
      HCV-infected persons who have evidence of liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood donors at the NIH Clinical Center or the Central Maryland Chapter of the American Red&#xD;
      Cross who test positive for HCV may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a&#xD;
      physical examination and history, including questions about socioeconomic status and current&#xD;
      sexual practices. They will have 100 milliliters (ml) (6 tablespoons) of blood drawn at the&#xD;
      first visit and 50 ml (3 tablespoons) drawn 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the initial visit.&#xD;
      Some participants may undergo plasmapheresis, a procedure for collecting additional plasma&#xD;
      (the liquid portion of the blood). For this procedure, whole blood is collected through a&#xD;
      needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into&#xD;
      its components. The plasma is then removed, and the red and white cells and platelets are&#xD;
      returned to the body, either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through a&#xD;
      second needle placed in the other arm. In some individuals, other body fluids (saliva, urine&#xD;
      or semen) may also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to bring their household contacts and sexual partners to NIH for&#xD;
      interview and blood testing for evidence of HCV infection and liver disease. Although this is&#xD;
      not required for participation in the study, it would provide additional valuable&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants found to have chronic viral infection will be seen more often and will provide&#xD;
      additional blood samples for routine medical care. Further medical evaluation may include&#xD;
      X-rays or liver scans and referral to a specialist for additional tests or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten people in this study will be recruited to participate in a secondary investigation to&#xD;
      analyze changes in the level of HCV and the immune response to it, and to relate these&#xD;
      changes to the degree of liver damage. In addition to blood collected for the primary study,&#xD;
      participants in this investigation will have an additional 50 ml (3 tablespoons) of blood&#xD;
      drawn from an arm vein every week for 10 weeks to measure levels of virus, ALT (a liver&#xD;
      enzyme), and immune response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At initiation of this study in 1991, approximately 0.6% of U.S. blood donors were identified&#xD;
      as having antibody to the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). This represented 72,000 of the&#xD;
      estimated 12 million annual U.S. blood donations. By investigating a cohort of anti-HCV&#xD;
      positive donors, this study aims to determine: 1) the primary routes of HCV transmission in&#xD;
      an asymptomatic donor population; 2) the relationship between anti-HCV and evidence of acute&#xD;
      or chronic liver disease; 3) the infectivity of anti-HCV positive individuals as judged by&#xD;
      measurement of HCV RNA and by investigation of their sexual partners and prior blood&#xD;
      recipients; 4) the chronic consequences of HCV infection. The study does not directly provide&#xD;
      treatment for HCV infection. Enrollment is limited to persons identified as anti-HCV positive&#xD;
      at the time of blood donation and persons from any source found to have clinical or molecular&#xD;
      evidence of acute hepatitis C virus infection. Although the primary goal of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate HCV infection and its outcomes, we occasionally encounter blood donors or NIH&#xD;
      patients who are infected with HBV or who have HCV-HBV coinfection. We will enroll such&#xD;
      patients to better understand HBV infection and to compare outcomes in those who are HCV&#xD;
      monoinfected, HBV monoinfected or who have HCV-HBV coinfection.&#xD;

        The study is now closed to accrual but patients were selected from NIH Blood donors who&#xD;
        were anti-HCV positive and who volunteered to be in the study.@@@&#xD;
