  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the role of chronic infection as a risk factor for vascular disease in a study&#xD;
      of Native Americans. The primary focus is on the two most common agents Chlamydia pneumoniae&#xD;
      and cytomegalovirus with a secondary emphasis on Helicobacter pylori.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have associated evidence of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection with coronary and&#xD;
      carotid atherosclerosis and evidence of increased infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) in&#xD;
      patients developing restenosis or with atherosclerosis. Several other common pathogens have&#xD;
      been less consistently associated with atherosclerosis. Altered parameters of inflammation&#xD;
      and hemostasis have been identified as prognostic factors of myocardial infarction and have&#xD;
      been linked as possible pathogenetic mechanisms. Recent studies have indicated that&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with coronary artery disease&#xD;
      frequently include Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA and stimulation of PBMCs can reflect an&#xD;
      unsuccessful host cellular immune response to CMV associated with elevated C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has both a nested case-control design and a nested cohort design within the Strong&#xD;
      Heart Study (SHS), an ongoing cohort study of 4,549 American Indians. The study utilizes&#xD;
      previously collected specimens, baseline data, and the ultrasound measurement of carotid wall&#xD;
      thickness (IMT) in SHS participants. Within the initial SHS cohort, 400 definite cases of&#xD;
      incident myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, and stroke are compared with 400&#xD;
      control individuals with no such diagnoses and matched for age, gender, and residence. Their&#xD;
      prior serum specimens are analyzed for Chlamydia pneumoniae-specific IgG, IgM antibody, for&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus-specific IgG antibody, and for C-reactive protein (CRP). In addition, assays&#xD;
      are performed for antibodies to Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis A virus, (HAV) and herpes&#xD;
      simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2. Correlations are made with baseline parameters of lipids,&#xD;
      coagulation, and adjusted for potential confounding variables of tobacco use, pneumonia, and&#xD;
      altered pulmonary function. An additional analysis of a subcohort, the above 400 controls, is&#xD;
      performed looking at the outcome of their carotid IMT, a parameter of subclinical&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, in relation to serologic results indicating a prior exposure to CMV,&#xD;
      Chlamydia pneumoniae, and/or other pathogens approximately eight years preceding ultrasound&#xD;
      testing. Both case-control and cohort analysis are stratified by levels of hemostasis and&#xD;
      inflammation, including CRP, fibrinogen, Lp(a), and plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1. A&#xD;
      separate nested substudy performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),&#xD;
      prospectively collected from 80 cases and 80 controls, examines the host T-cell proliferative&#xD;
      response to CMV and other pathogens in relation to disease and also searches for a chronic&#xD;
      persistent infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae evidence by DNA detection.&#xD;
