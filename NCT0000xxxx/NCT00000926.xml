      The purpose of this study is to see if nonoxynol-9 (N-9) gel used in the vagina can prevent&#xD;
      the spread of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the people with HIV in the world today live in southern Africa. Because this&#xD;
      population is not likely to use condoms, an HIV-prevention method that women can control is&#xD;
      needed. N-9 used in the vagina may help prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually&#xD;
      transmitted diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravaginal application of N-9 may help protect women from HIV and other STD infection. Low&#xD;
      rates of condom use in sub-Saharan African populations, which constitute the majority of HIV&#xD;
      infections, dictate the need for prophylactic methods women can control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in Zimbabwe and Malawi. The Phase III trial is preceded by a&#xD;
      2-week safety and acceptability pilot study to determine the extent of genital irritation&#xD;
      caused by N-9 and the placebo. Following the pilot study and prior to screening for&#xD;
      enrollment in the Phase III trial, potential volunteers will participate in a 2-month&#xD;
      behavioral counseling program that will encourage the use of condoms. Only participants who&#xD;
      decide they cannot or will not be consistent condom users are enrolled in the main study.&#xD;
      Study participants are given N-9 gel or placebo to use each time they have vaginal sexual&#xD;
      intercourse for 18 to 36 months. Participants have a follow-up evaluation once a month; a&#xD;
      pelvic exam and blood tests are performed every third month.&#xD;
