  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to learn more about how the immune and hormonal systems function in patients&#xD;
      with Sjogren's syndrome, a disease in which the immune system does not function properly.&#xD;
      Adult nonpregnant females are invited to participate. Oral contraceptives may not be taken&#xD;
      for 6 weeks before and during this study, so another form of birth control must be used, such&#xD;
      as abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two visits. At the first visit, a medical history and physical examination will&#xD;
      be conducted, and blood and urine tests will be done. The total amount of blood drawn will be&#xD;
      10 tablespoons. This visit will last 3 hours. At the second visit, participants will have an&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test. To prepare for it, they must be on a special diet for 3 days&#xD;
      beforehand and keep a diary of eating, sleeping, and physical activities for those 3 days. A&#xD;
      urine sample will be taken at the beginning of the visit. Subjects must then drink a very&#xD;
      sweet carbonated cola. A small plastic tube will be placed into an arm vein. Blood will be&#xD;
      drawn through this tube eight times over 3 hours. The total amount of blood drawn will be 17&#xD;
      tablespoons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only minor inconveniences are anticipated as a result of participating in this study. Risks&#xD;
      from blood tests include soreness, bruising, and minor infection at the puncture site, and&#xD;
      dizziness. The oral glucose tolerance test may cause temporary stomach bloating, headache,&#xD;
      nausea, and vomiting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic systemic disease that primarily affects the salivary and&#xD;
      lacrimal glands and is characterized by lymphocytic tissue infiltration and auto-antibody&#xD;
      production. The pathogenesis of Sjogren's syndrome is unknown. We hypothesize that reduced&#xD;
      somatostatin activity is an important factor in promoting immune dysregulation in patients&#xD;
      affected by Sjogren's syndrome. Somatostatin is a multifunctional peptide with potent&#xD;
      immunomodulatory properties whose effects are reduced lymphocytic activity, reduced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal secretions, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, etc. As several findings in Sjogren's syndrome are opposite to those&#xD;
      produced by somatostatin, it is logical to consider that the activity of this peptide is low&#xD;
      in patients affected by this disease. The purpose of this study is to determine whether basal&#xD;
      and stimulated plasma levels of somatostatin and its effects on the immune and endocrine&#xD;
      systems differ between 16 patients affected by primary Sjogren's syndrome and 16 healthy&#xD;
      control subjects.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Female gender only, ages 18 to 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should have documented primary Sjogren's syndrome as determined by protocol&#xD;
        84-D-0056. The diagnosis of primary Sjogren's syndrome will be based on the presence of all&#xD;
        three of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Salivary gland abnormalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lacrimal gland abnormalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serologic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls should have no signs or symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome, and negative serologic&#xD;
        testing reconfirmed within 2 weeks of the OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to: a) participate in phase I and II of the protocol; b) follow the guidelines&#xD;
        set to prepare for the OGTT; and c) modify current medical therapy if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be able to comply with protocol procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with &quot;incomplete&quot; Sjogren's syndrome, i.e., with less than three positive&#xD;
        findings as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No presence of physical or mental conditions that may interfere with the protocol. These&#xD;
        include the following diseases and conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (Present at time of phase I/II): significant disruption of sleep-wake pattern (i.e., less&#xD;
        than 4 hours of continuous sleep, on the night before the OGTT only), BMI less than 18 or&#xD;
        equal to/greater than 30, anemia with Hgb less than 10 gm/dl, use of tobacco or alcohol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (Within the past 6 weeks): acute weight change (greater than 5%), use of contraceptives&#xD;
        -BCP-, Depoprovera or Norplant), irregular menstrual cycle, lactation, blood drawing in&#xD;
        excess of 50 ml, use of recreational drugs, modification of estrogen replacement therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (Within the past 6 months): chronic pattern of weight change (greater than 10%), eating&#xD;
        disorders, uncontrolled hypo/hyperthyroidism, breast cancer, lymphoma or other malignancy,&#xD;

        distress within one week of the OGTT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Low carbohydrate diet (less than 150 g/day) for 3 days preceding the OGTT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Therapy which impairs glucose tolerance: e.g., niacin, thiazide diuretics, phenytoin,&#xD;
        excess thyroxine or psychotropic drugs within 1 month of phase I, oral contraceptives&#xD;
        within 6 weeks of phase I, glucocorticoid treatment within the past 6 months (or one year&#xD;
        if treatment lasted over 2 weeks), Beta blockers/agonists (e.g., terbutaline) within 2 days&#xD;
        of phase I;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diabetes mellitus;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Glucose intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects may not take medications that can affect somatostatin levels, such as&#xD;
        antidepressants, benzodiazepines, neuromodulators (e.g., cholinergic, alpha/beta&#xD;
        adrenergic), oral contraceptives (BCP), steroid hormones (with the exception of estrogen&#xD;
        replacement therapy -ERT-, for which subjects will be matched), immunomodulators,&#xD;
        anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine), cimetidine -Tagamet® (Registered Trademark)-, herbal&#xD;
        remedies (because of their variable substance content). Subjects may not take drugs&#xD;
        affecting gastrin secretion: antacids (e.g., Maalox® (Registered Trademark), Mylanta®&#xD;
        (Registered Trademark), H(2) receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine -Pepcid® (Registered&#xD;
        Trademark)-, ranitidine -Zantac® (Registered Trademark)-), cathecolamines, atropine,&#xD;
        haloperidol. To become eligible, subjects should be able to safely discontinue these&#xD;
        medications at least one month prior to phase I. Antacids, H(2) antagonists and&#xD;
        neuromodulators (e.g., Salagen) may be discontinued 2 days prior to phase I.&#xD;
