      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension, an exceedingly common trait in most developed countries, imparts an increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal diseases. Nevertheless, the primary&#xD;
      determinants of elevated blood pressure in most patients are unknown. Recognizing that a&#xD;
      sizable portion of variation in blood pressure is genetically determined, one line of&#xD;
      research has focused on identifying genetic variants that contribute to the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      hypertension. However, standard genetic linkage analysis using &quot;hypertension&quot; as a phenotype&#xD;
      may lack power due to the multifactorial nature of the disorder. A way to overcome this&#xD;
      challenge is to subdivide hypertensive subjects into more homogenous subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal, which is to define the underlying genetics of hypertension in an Asian&#xD;
      population by studying intermediate phenotypes, can be divided into three parts. First, the&#xD;
      rural Chinese population will be characterized by the collection of intermediate phenotype&#xD;
      data on 600 unrelated individuals with high diastolic blood pressure and on 100 normotensive&#xD;
      controls. Intermediate phenotypes include: 1) non-modulation of adrenal and renal vascular&#xD;
      responses to angiotensin II with changes in sodium intake; 2) altered urinary kallikrein&#xD;
      excretion; 3) low plasma renin activity response to volume depletion; 4) increased free&#xD;
      cortisol excretion; and 5) insulin resistance. Second, candidate genes will be chosen&#xD;
      according to the underlying physiology of the intermediate phenotypes, and variations in the&#xD;
      coding sequences of these potentially relevant genes will be identified. Finally,&#xD;
      polymorphisms identified in the candidate genes will be tested through case-control analyses&#xD;
      defined by the intermediate phenotypes.&#xD;
