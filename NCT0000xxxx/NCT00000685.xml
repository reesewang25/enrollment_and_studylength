  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine how zidovudine (AZT) for the treatment of HIV infection is metabolized and&#xD;
      excreted or eliminated in patients with infected or diseased kidneys. To determine the&#xD;
      influence of hemodialysis and establish dose guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZT is the only antiviral agent with demonstrated effectiveness in patients with severe HIV&#xD;
      infection. Persons with HIV infection may have additional health problems, one of which is a&#xD;
      diseased kidney due to infection of the kidney, or side effects of therapy. The benefits and&#xD;
      risks of AZT in patients with diseased kidneys are unknown. It is hoped that this study will&#xD;
      allow further understanding of the metabolism and excretion of AZT in patients with kidney&#xD;
      disease. AZT pharmacokinetics will be studied in patients with mild, moderate, and severe&#xD;
      renal disorders&#xD;

      AZT is the only antiviral agent with demonstrated effectiveness in patients with severe HIV&#xD;
      infection. Persons with HIV infection may have additional health problems, one of which is a&#xD;
      diseased kidney due to infection of the kidney, or side effects of therapy. The benefits and&#xD;
      risks of AZT in patients with diseased kidneys are unknown. It is hoped that this study will&#xD;
      allow further understanding of the metabolism and excretion of AZT in patients with kidney&#xD;
      disease. AZT pharmacokinetics will be studied in patients with mild, moderate, and severe&#xD;
      renal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive AZT by mouth on the first day. After taking the AZT, blood samples are taken&#xD;
      from a catheter and several urine samples are collected over a 24-hour period. During this&#xD;
      time, patients remain in the hospital for the 24 hours or may choose to go home 12 hours&#xD;
      after taking the AZT dose and return for the last blood sample the next morning. Following&#xD;
      study day 1, patients receive AZT every 4 hours, including in the middle of the night, and&#xD;
      keep a diary of the times they take AZT, as well as of the use of other medications, tobacco,&#xD;
      or alcohol. A return appointment is made for 8-15 days later. On that day, patients again&#xD;
      receive AZT by mouth, and blood tests and urine samples are again taken. Patients who are&#xD;
      receiving hemodialysis participate in 1 additional day of pharmacokinetic studies to be&#xD;
      arranged during one hemodialysis session. Patients on Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal&#xD;
      Dialysis (CAPD) are studied separately and do not participate in the procedures for the other&#xD;
      groups. AZT is given as a single oral dose at the beginning of the first morning exchange&#xD;
      followed by a pharmacokinetic study. Chronic AZT dosing is initiated following the first&#xD;
      exchange. After a minimum of 7 days of AZT therapy and a maximum of 14 days the last dose of&#xD;
      AZT is administered and a repeat pharmacokinetic study is done. All patients are seen again&#xD;
      1-2 weeks after completing the last pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;
