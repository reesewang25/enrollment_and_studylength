  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will evaluate patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and their&#xD;
      relatives to learn more about how the disease develops and changes over time. It will also&#xD;
      study genetic factors that make a person susceptible to SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 10 years of age and older with known or suspected SLE and their relatives may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients will be evaluated with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, blood and urine tests. Other procedures may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Imaging studies, such as chest and joint X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans,&#xD;
           bone scans, and bone densitometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Questionnaire about the degree of disease activity, and survey of risk factors for&#xD;
           disease complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Apheresis Collection of plasma (fluid portion of blood) or blood cells for analysis.&#xD;
           Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a&#xD;
           machine that separates it into its components. The required component (plasma or cells)&#xD;
           is removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle or&#xD;
           through a second needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Skin biopsy Removal of a small skin sample for microscopic analysis. An area of skin is&#xD;
           numbed with an anesthetic and a small circular portion (about 1/4 inch in diameter) is&#xD;
           removed, using a sharp cookie cutter-type instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Kidney, bone marrow or other organ biopsy Removal of a small sample of organ tissue.&#xD;
           These biopsies are done only if they can provide information useful in better&#xD;
           understanding the disease or making treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Genetic studies Collection of a blood sample for gene testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at least once a year with a brief history and physical examination&#xD;
      and routine blood and urine tests. Some patients may be seen more often. Treatment&#xD;
      recommendations will be offered to patients' physicians, and patients who are eligible for&#xD;
      other research treatment studies will be invited to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating relatives of patients will fill out a brief medical history questionnaire and&#xD;
      provide a DNA sample (either a blood sample or tissue swab from the inside of the cheek) for&#xD;
      genetic testing....&#xD;

      This research protocol will evaluate subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and&#xD;
      their relatives to study the pathogenesis and natural history of the disease and the&#xD;
      mechanisms leading to enhanced organ damage. Patients will be evaluated by a history and&#xD;
      physical examination and routine laboratory studies will be obtained as needed to assess&#xD;
      disease activity or complications of the disease and to monitor for drug-related toxicities.&#xD;
      Blood, skin or urine specimens may be requested for research purposes, including genetic&#xD;
      studies. In addition, a subset of these patients will undergo several tests to understand the&#xD;
      pathogenic changes affecting their blood vessels. Patients who are eligible for other&#xD;
      research protocols will be offered the opportunity to participate in these studies by signed&#xD;
      informed consent. Any medical care recommended or provided to the patient will be consistent&#xD;
      with routine standards of practice and provided in consultation with the patient's referring&#xD;
      physician. Blood and urine samples and cardiovascular testing will also be collected or&#xD;
      applied to from healthy volunteers for research purposes and to support the identification&#xD;
      and validation of new biomarker candidates.&#xD;
