      To investigate the relationship between HCMV and bone marrow progenitor cells to understand&#xD;
      whether HCMV is latent in CD34 + bone marrow progenitors and the mechanism by which the virus&#xD;
      remains in a latent state.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite progress in understanding the pathophysiology of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)&#xD;
      infections, its manifestations in the immune compromised host are frequently associated with&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality. In this setting, HCMV disease can develop e.g. following immune&#xD;
      suppression as a result of reactivation of latent HCMV acquired earlier in life. The&#xD;
      mechanisms leading to establishment of latent infections and their subsequent reactivation&#xD;
      are not clear. It is also unknown whether HCMV exists in a latent form with limited viral&#xD;
      gene expression or as a persistent infection with normal virus transcription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study were to: 1) examine the percentage of HCMV positive donors&#xD;
      whose bone marrow progenitors contained HCMV DNA using nested PCR and determine if virus&#xD;
      could be rescued from those cells. 2) Analyze the HCMV life cycle in hematopoietic progenitor&#xD;
      and stem cells. 3) identify and analyze HCMV gene expression in in vivo infected leukocytes.&#xD;
      Bone marrow progenitors containing HCMV DNA detectable by nested PCR were isolated from human&#xD;
      donors and used as as source of mRNA to prepare Cdna libraries. 4) Determine if gene(s)&#xD;
      expressed in bone marrow progenitors were important in either establishing or maintaining a&#xD;
      latent infection or in the lytic cycle of HCMV. Information provided from the above studies&#xD;
      yielded information important in planning future approaches for the therapy of HCMV&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
