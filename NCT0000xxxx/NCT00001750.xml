  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some drugs have the ability to push stem cells (the cells responsible for producing new cell&#xD;
      types) out of the bone marrow and into the blood stream. The steps involved in this process&#xD;
      are still poorly understood. However, a better understanding of this process could lead to&#xD;
      improved results in transplantation, cancer treatment, and contribute to the development of&#xD;
      new genetic therapies for a wide variety of disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers plan to compare two different treatments, both that mobilize (push)&#xD;
      stem cells out of the bone marrow into the blood stream. In addition, researchers will&#xD;
      attempt to determine which is the most efficient at mobilizing blood cells of patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and knowledge gained from this study will help to design future transplantation&#xD;
      and genetic therapy research studies.&#xD;

      Some drugs, such as hematopoietic cytokines, result in mobilization of primitive stem cells&#xD;
      out of the bone marrow space and into the blood, but the mechanisms of this process are still&#xD;
      poorly understood. A better understanding of this process could greatly improve clinical&#xD;
      results in transplantation, cancer treatment, and potentially genetic therapy of a wide&#xD;
      variety of disorders. In this protocol, we will study two different mobilization treatments&#xD;
      and compare how efficient they are at increasing the number of primitive cells in the blood&#xD;
      in patients with multiple myeloma. These cells will be collected by apheresis, and used for&#xD;
      autologous transplantation following high dose chemotherapy. This aggressive approach to&#xD;
      treatment in multiple myeloma has been shown to improve remission rates and survival without&#xD;
      active disease. The use of a larger number of blood stem cells may decrease the toxicity&#xD;
      associated with the procedure. In the research laboratory, we will study a number of&#xD;
      characteristics of the primitive cells in the blood and the bone marrow after treatment with&#xD;
      the mobilizing drugs. These studies will help us to design future transplantation and genetic&#xD;
      therapy protocols.&#xD;

&#xD;
        An established diagnosis of multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and a life-expectancy of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Marrow cellularity greater than 20 percent, with less than or equal to 30 percent plasma&#xD;
        cells within one month of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelet count greater than 100,000/ul, ANC greater than 1200/ul.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Demonstration of a partial or complete response to initial or salvage therapy (a minimum of&#xD;
        a 50 percent reduction in the detectable serum paraprotein or at least a 90 percent&#xD;
        reduction in the detectable urine monoclonal light chains, stable for at least four weeks&#xD;
        prior to entry into study). A cumulative total of less than or equal to 6 cycles of&#xD;
        regimens containing alkylating agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bilirubin less than 2.0, transaminases less than 2x upper limit of normal, serum creatinine&#xD;
        less than 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability and willingness to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior bone marrow or PBSC transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Extensive marrow fibrosis, non-aspirable marrow, myelodysplastic changes or greater than 30&#xD;
        percent marrow plasma cells.&#xD;

        Prior treatment with greater than 6 cycles of chemotherapy regimens containing alkylating&#xD;
        agents such as melphalan, cyclophosphamide or BCNU.&#xD;

        myocardial infarction within 6 months, uncontrolled arrhythmias, or any other medical&#xD;
        condition felt by the principal investigator to unduly increase the risk of autologous&#xD;
        transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;

        allergies, manifest solely by rash, and/or urticaria are not excluded.&#xD;
