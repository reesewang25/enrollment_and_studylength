  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide a comprehensive analysis of risk factors for the development of clinical&#xD;
      cardiotoxicities in over 6,000 children with cancer who had been treated on standardized&#xD;
      protocols involving the use of anthracyclines alone or in combination with other potentially&#xD;
      cardiotoxic therapies or with no use of anthracycline therapy.&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were analyzed to estimate the incidence of clinical cardiotoxicity as measured by&#xD;
      sudden death, congestive heart failure, or discontinuation of therapy based on cardiac&#xD;
      function. Evaluation of patient characteristics (age, anemia) and treatment factors such as&#xD;
      drug, dose level, dosing schedule, exposure to irradiation and/or cyclophosphamide identified&#xD;
      groups at particularly high risk for development of clinical cardiotoxicity and provided&#xD;
      estimates of this risk for future treatment planning. Such estimates of high risk groups&#xD;
      should make possible future trials to test the feasibility of using cardioprotectors or&#xD;
      alternate dosing schedules to prevent cardiotoxicity. The incidence of clinical&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity was calculated using Kaplan- Meier estimates as a function of total cumulative&#xD;
      anthracycline dose and also as a function of the time since the end of treatment stratified&#xD;
      by dose levels. The estimates were stratified by exposure to cyclophosphamide and radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Multivariate methods were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of selected&#xD;
      patient characteristics and treatment parameters and to provide estimates of the relative&#xD;
      risk of each variable. The method of recursive partitioning was used to identify&#xD;
      subpopulations at elevated risk for clinical cardiotoxicity. The data and analytic techniques&#xD;
      were accessible through SAS data sets and procedures available to the study at the Pediatric&#xD;
      Oncology Group (POG) Statistical Office.&#xD;
