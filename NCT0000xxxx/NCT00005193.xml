      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a major health hazard in Oklahoma Indians. A further important aspect is the&#xD;
      apparently high vulnerability of the diabetic Oklahoma Indians to atherosclerotic disease. In&#xD;
      the mid 1980s, this group had the highest prevalence of 0-wave changes on the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and amputation for ischemic gangrene of all 14 international samples in the&#xD;
      World Health Organization Multinational Study. Its cardiovascular mortality rates were 2-3&#xD;
      times those of other national samples. An epidemic of coronary heart disease was attacking&#xD;
      this Indian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 1973 and 1978, 1,085 adult Oklahoma Indians who were diagnosed with non-insulin&#xD;
      dependent diabetes mellitus were recruited for a study on diabetes. The data from the study&#xD;
      were used in part for the World Health Organization Multinational Study of Vascular Disease&#xD;
      in Diabetes. The subjects were given a complete physical examination which included blood&#xD;
      pressure, height, weight, electrocardiogram and detailed eye examination. Data were also&#xD;
      collected on plasma cholesterol, plasma triglyceride, and proteinuria. Family histories and&#xD;
      body weight were reviewed. The study followed this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This longitudinal study followed a previously studied cohort. Detailed baseline data&#xD;
      collected in 1973-1978 were available. In phase I of the study, the life/death status of all&#xD;
      1,085 subjects was ascertained up to January 1, 1986. Death certificates were obtained and&#xD;
      cause of death analyzed. For the survivors, a personal interview and physical examination&#xD;
      were performed in Phase II. Occurrence of specified diabetes-related vascular complications&#xD;
      was documented. The detailed follow-up questionnaire included all the data required for the&#xD;
      WHO Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetes plus specific information related to&#xD;
      this population. Analysis was conducted on overall mortality rates, disease-specific&#xD;
      mortality rates, and survival time. Prevalence and incidence of morbidity from micro- and&#xD;
      macrovascular complications were estimated. The extent to which selected risk factors were&#xD;
      associated with or could predict the development of vascular diseases was examined. The&#xD;
      results of the analyses were compared with those obtained in the WHO Multinational Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
