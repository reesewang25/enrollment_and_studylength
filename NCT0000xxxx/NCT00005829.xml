      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing&#xD;
      so they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating patients who&#xD;
      have recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the rate and duration of complete and partial remission in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with gemcitabine. II. Assess the&#xD;
      toxicities of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses. Patients achieving clinical complete remission,&#xD;
      complete remission, nodular partial remission, or partial remission following 3 courses of&#xD;
      therapy, receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients achieving complete remission or&#xD;
      further improvement following the 2 additional courses of therapy, receive another 2 courses&#xD;
      of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or relapse.&#xD;
      Patients achieving complete remission are followed every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia manifested by all&#xD;
        of the following: Minimum threshold peripheral lymphocyte count of at least 5,000/mm3 Small&#xD;
        to medium sized peripheral blood lymphocytes with no greater than 55% prolymphocytes Bone&#xD;
        marrow aspirate and biopsy containing at least 30% lymphoid cells Immunophenotypic and&#xD;
        biopsy evaluation of peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrating monoclonality of B&#xD;
        lymphocytes B-cell markers with CD5 antigen (e.g., T-1, T-101) in the absence of other pan&#xD;
        T-cell markers (e.g., CD3, CD2) Expression of CD19, CD20, and CD23 B cell surface markers&#xD;
        B-cell expression of kappa or lambda light chains Active disease with at least one of the&#xD;
        following criteria: One or more disease related symptoms: At least 10% weight loss within&#xD;
        the past 6 months Fever greater than 100.5 F for at least 2 weeks without evidence of&#xD;
        infection Night sweats without evidence of infection Evidence of progressive marrow failure&#xD;

        and/or thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/mm3) (i.e., any stage III or IV&#xD;
        disease) Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroid&#xD;

        than 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive lymphadenopathy (i.e., a greater than 50%&#xD;
        increase over two months) Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of greater than 50%&#xD;
        over a 2 month period (unrelated to corticosteroids) or an anticipated doubling time of&#xD;
        less than 6 months No marked hypogammaglobulinemia or the development of a monoclonal&#xD;
        protein in the absence of any criteria for active disease Previously treated with at least&#xD;
        a fludarabine or cladribine based regimen and a prior alkylating agent with evidence of&#xD;
        recurrent or progressive disease&#xD;
