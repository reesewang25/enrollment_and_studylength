      The first part of this study will use the database of a large, ongoing NIH-sponsored lupus&#xD;
      study, Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment. We will examine the&#xD;
      levels of a blood protein known as C3a in a series of patient blood samples to see if C3a&#xD;
      levels predict lupus flares or are better than other blood tests, and therefore should be&#xD;
      used more widely in managing lupus. In the second part of the study we will add or increase&#xD;
      prednisone treatment on the basis of abnormalities in blood tests for C3a and dsDNA&#xD;
      antibodies. Early treatment based on increases in C3a and dsDNA antibodies, before the&#xD;
      patient develops physical signs of disease, may reduce lupus flares and, ultimately, the&#xD;
      patient's total steroid exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will follow study participants for 1 year on a monthly basis and do full physical&#xD;
      examinations and laboratory evaluations. If C3a and dsDNA antibody levels are increased&#xD;
      significantly above baseline levels while a patient is clinically stable, we will give the&#xD;
      patient either prednisone or an inactive pill (placebo) for 1 month. We will follow these&#xD;
      patients monthly to compare how often lupus flares occur in the two groups. This approach&#xD;
      could provide a novel method of preventing lupus flares, using C3a as a sensitive predictor&#xD;
      of flare.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In lupus, serial evaluation of dsDNA antibody titers and complement (C3 and C4) in blood&#xD;
      samples have been useful in assessing disease activity in patients. High levels of C3a, a&#xD;
      split product of C3, are particularly sensitive and reflective of lupus flares. Our study&#xD;
      looks at whether elevations in C3a can predict lupus flares and how C3a compares with other&#xD;
      conventional blood indicators such as dsDNA antibody, C3, C4, and CH50. The utility of serial&#xD;
      anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement measurements in clinical decision-making for people with&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains controversial. This study has two specific parts&#xD;
      designed to address these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first, we will take advantage of a unique opportunity to collaborate with a large,&#xD;
      multicenter NIH-sponsored protocol, the Safety of Estrogens in Systemic Lupus National&#xD;
      Assessment (SELENA) trial. We will perform an observational study of approximately 1,000&#xD;
      women enrolled in the SELENA trial to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive&#xD;
      value of anti-dsDNA antibodies, C3, C4, CH50, and C3a desArg. Using samples from patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the SELENA study, we will perform subgroup analyses in diverse ethnic groups,&#xD;
      patients treated with exogenous estrogen, and patients with chronically depressed CH50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second-an interventional study-we will evaluate the effectiveness of short-term&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatment in averting flares when elevations of plasma C3a are accompanied by&#xD;
      rising anti-dsDNA antibody. We will determine whether corticosteroid treatment reduces the&#xD;
      frequency of clinical flare, serological abnormalities, or disease activity in inactive or&#xD;
      stable patients. We will explore whether steroids disproportionately exacerbate or initiate&#xD;
      comorbid medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) that may be more prevalent among&#xD;
      minority patients. The studies should result in observations that lead to rational,&#xD;
      cost-effective, and evidence-based guidelines that improve the treatment of patients with SLE&#xD;
      and-by decreasing the morbidity of disease-result in significant improvement of their quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
