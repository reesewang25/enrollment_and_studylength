  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several dideoxynucleosides have now been shown to have activity against HIV but to have&#xD;
      different toxicities. This study will involve therapy of patients with AIDS or ARC with two&#xD;
      of these agents, AZT and 2', 3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), which have different toxicity profiles,&#xD;
      over a 2-year period of time. The rationale for using the two drugs will be to reduce&#xD;
      toxicity and also possibly to delay or prevent the development of resistance. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either an alternating regimen or a continuous simultaneous regimen&#xD;
      with these two drugs. The study will be structured as a randomized pilot study.&#xD;

        Patients with AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection who have 10-350 CD4+ T cells per mm(3) and&#xD;
        an estimated life-expectancy of over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the purpose of this study, a patient is defined as having symptomatic HIV infection if&#xD;
        he or she has a history of or has active thrush (oral candidiasis); a history of or active&#xD;
        oral hairy leukoplakia; herpes zoster within the last 3 years; recurrent seborrheic&#xD;
        dermatitis or puritic folliculitis; weight loss of 4.5 kg or 10 percent of body weight not&#xD;
        caused by dieting; unexplained intermittent diarrhea (2 or more liquid stools per day)&#xD;
        within the last 4 months; night sweats; mild cognitive impairment; or fatigue interfering&#xD;
        with activity within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lymphadenopathy will not, in itself, be considered as sufficient for being considered as&#xD;
        having symptomatic HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must have serum antibodies to HIV, ambulatory status, and capacity to give&#xD;
        informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior use of dideoxynucleoside therapy (including but not restricted to AZT, ddC, or&#xD;
        ddI) for over 3 months. However, preference will be given to patients who have received&#xD;
        them for 1 month or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnancy or the possibility of becoming pregnant during drug administration. Female&#xD;
        patients of child-bearing age must have a negative pregnancy test just prior to enrollment&#xD;
        and agree to practice birth control while on the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No past or present evidence of renal disease (CRC1 estimated or determined to be less than&#xD;
        50 ml/min/1.73 m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded if they have any one of the following hematologic abnormalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hb less than 10.0 gm per dl or transfusion within the last month, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        WBC less than 2000 per mm(3) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelets less than 75,000 per mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of hepatic cirrhosis or present hepatic dysfunction with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Total bilirubin greater than 3.0 mg per dl (2x the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alkaline phosphatase greater than 372 U per l (3x the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        AST/GOT greater than 132 U per l (3x the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No evidence of severe diarrhea (over 5 stools per day), an underlying severe infection&#xD;
        (including CMV retinitis, colitis, or pneumonitis); or evidence of Kaposi's sarcoma or&#xD;
        other tumor which is likely to require specific anti-tumor therapy within 24 months of&#xD;
        entering the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        As a practical matter, only patients with Kaposi's sarcoma who have a few cutaneous lesions&#xD;
        with no mucosal or internal lesions will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be ineligible if they have some evidence of active life-threatening&#xD;
        infections with bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoan pathogens at the time of entry into&#xD;
        the study. In general, patients who have had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius within the past&#xD;
        10 days will in general be ineligible unless it is apparent that this is not the result of&#xD;
        a severe underlying infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No known hypersensitivity reactions to or major toxicities from AZT or ddI. (This would&#xD;
        include anaphylaxis reactions, hives, or Stevens Johnson syndrome, but would not include&#xD;
        the minor rash occasionally seen with ddI.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to give informed consent, attend the outpatient clinic, and&#xD;
        refrain from unprotected sexual contact or other activities which may result in&#xD;
        re-infection with HIV. Present use of illicit drugs (for example, heroin or cocaine) or&#xD;
        ingestion of substantial alcohol (enough to increase the risk of pancreatitis) will exclude&#xD;
        the patient from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No evidence of underlying cardiac disease, history of pancreatitis, or peripheral&#xD;
        neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No treatment within the last 4 months with suramin, treatment within the last 3 months with&#xD;
        ribavirin, or treatment within the past 4 weeks with any anti-retroviral drug, cytotoxic&#xD;
        chemotherapeutic agents, steroids, interferon, or immunomodulating agents.&#xD;
