    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the long-term progress of people with&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related conditions such as anorexia nervosa, Tourette&#xD;
      syndrome, and trichotillomania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the screening and follow-up of individuals with OCD and OCD-related&#xD;
      disorders. Participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric evaluation,&#xD;
      questionnaires, and neurological testing. Participants will then have study visits every 4 to&#xD;
      12 weeks to undergo symptom and daily functioning evaluations, personality tests, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, memory tests, brain scans, and other clinical exams. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed with interviews and paper-and-pencil or computer-assisted tests. Participants may&#xD;
      have the opportunity to participate in drug studies and to join a monthly OCD support group.&#xD;
      At the end of the study, participants will be referred to community or private treatment&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to allow for careful screening and follow-up of patients with&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and OCD-related disorders for a variety of protocols,&#xD;
      recording demographic and rating information over the long-term course of the OCD illness and&#xD;
      associated anxiety and depression symptoms. Patients in this study will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the naturalistic baseline assessment phase to better understand the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and long-term course of illness. As a part of this protocol, subjects will be&#xD;
      systematically administered assessment measures including diagnostic and psychological&#xD;
      screening tests, a psychiatric assessment, SCID I and SCID II interviews, as well as other&#xD;
      rating scales. They will also be informed of their opportunity to participate in research&#xD;
      procedures such as blood draws and MRI of the brain. Upon conclusion of their participation,&#xD;
      they will be referred out to community/private treatment when appropriate. All will be&#xD;
      offered participation in an ongoing support group. This protocol will serve as an entry point&#xD;
      for individuals with OCD and OCD-related disorders to proceed into other investigation&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

        study and to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals can be included if they have certain medical conditions that have been&#xD;
        described to have a higher incidence of OCD/depression and anxiety disorders: e.g.,&#xD;
        individuals with underlying neurological or neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., tic&#xD;
        disorders or dystonias, including torticollis and blepharospasm), connective tissue&#xD;
        disorders, but must show no other serious or acute medical illnesses as determined by a&#xD;
        physical exam and standard laboratory examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
