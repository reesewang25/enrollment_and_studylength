  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with uveitis are at high risk for significant complications following cataract&#xD;
      surgery with intraocular lens implantation. Complications may result from the surgery itself&#xD;
      or may develop after surgery as a result of the intraocular lens. Complications related to&#xD;
      intraocular lens implantation include iris adhesions to the intraocular lens, which can&#xD;
      result in lens capture; cellular deposits on the surface of the lens that can obscure vision;&#xD;
      and uveitis. Recent studies have identified giant cells on the anterior surface of&#xD;
      intraocular lenses in some patients with uveitis, appearing to indicate an intraocular&#xD;
      lens-induced inflammatory response. Some of these patients have required multiple YAG laser&#xD;
      procedures to remove these deposits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modification of the surface of the intraocular lens with a layer of heparin may provide a&#xD;
      more biocompatible surface. Preclinical studies have shown a reduction in the degree of&#xD;
      postoperative complications with the heparin surface-modified intraocular lens compared with&#xD;
      an unmodified lens. Although retrospective case series have examined the use of heparin&#xD;
      surface-modified intraocular lenses in patients with uveitis, a randomized, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial has not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of the heparin&#xD;
      surface-modified intraocular lens in patients with uveitis. Eighty patients with a history of&#xD;
      uveitis in an eye requiring cataract surgery will be randomized to receive a heparin&#xD;
      surface-modified intraocular lens or the same model of intraocular lens without surface&#xD;
      modification. The primary end point of the study will be the development of cellular deposits&#xD;
      on the anterior surface of the intraocular lens 1 year after surgery. These cellular deposits&#xD;
      will be assessed by a masked grader using standard photographs. Secondary end points will&#xD;
      include visual acuity, intraocular inflammation, development of anterior and posterior&#xD;
      synechiae, and corneal endothelial cell counts.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Women and men 18 years or older with a documented history of uveitis in an eye requiring&#xD;
        cataract surgery are eligible for the study. In all patients, the eye must be free of&#xD;
        active inflammation for at least 3 months before surgery, with or without anti-inflammatory&#xD;
        medications. Exclusion criteria include corneal pathology or hazy media that preclude&#xD;
        evaluation of the intraocular lens, uncontrolled glaucoma, and diabetes mellitus. Monocular&#xD;
        patients and patients who cannot be followed for at least 1 year are also excluded.&#xD;
