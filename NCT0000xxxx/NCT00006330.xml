  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) is a natural product that is popular in European and American&#xD;
      herbal medicine practice. Some of its cardiac uses include the treatment of high and low&#xD;
      blood pressure, rapid heart beat, chest pain, and blocked arteries. In many cases, it is used&#xD;
      as an adjuvant agent with other cardiac drugs such as digoxin, amiodarone, and warfarin. To&#xD;
      date, little information is known about the effect of hawthorn when taken with other drugs&#xD;
      and if toxicities occur when hawthorn is used with other drugs. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to examine the interaction between digoxin and hawthorn in eight healthy subjects. Subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited by advertisement. The design of the study will include a 10-day and a&#xD;
      three-week treatment phase of digoxin 0.125 mg - 0.25 mg/day and hawthorn (Crataegus special&#xD;
      extract WS1442, Schwabe Co.) 450 mg twice daily or placebo, with a randomized crossover.&#xD;
      There will be a three-week washout period in between treatment phases. On day 10 (phase I)&#xD;
      and day 21 (phase II), subjects will have 12 blood samples drawn for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis. The plasma samples will be measured for digoxin concentration. Additionally, the&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for any clinical toxicities or adverse events. The significance of&#xD;
      this study is to provide the clinician with information regarding the safe use of digoxin in&#xD;
      combination with the herbal supplement, hawthorn.&#xD;
