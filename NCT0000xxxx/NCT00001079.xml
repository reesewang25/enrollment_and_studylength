  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that the predominant accrual of fat rather than lean body mass (LBM)&#xD;
      that occurs during treatment of HIV-associated wasting with megestrol acetate may be improved&#xD;
      by treatment with megestrol acetate and testosterone enanthate in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body wasting is an increasingly frequent AIDS-defining condition in individuals infected with&#xD;
      HIV. Increasing caloric intake fails to consistently restore lean tissue patients with HIV&#xD;
      associated weight loss. Megestrol acetate has been shown to stimulate appetite and weight&#xD;
      gain in subjects with cancer and in those with HIV associated weight loss. However, the&#xD;
      weight gained during treatment with megestrol acetate was predominantly or exclusively fat.&#xD;
      An important factor is the preferential increase in body fat seen in both of these studies&#xD;
      may have been due to hypogonadism that occurs as a result of treatment with megestrol&#xD;
      acetate, a progestational agent. Hypogonadism is associated with an increase in body fat and&#xD;
      a decrease in LBM. Concomitant testosterone replacement should substantially increase the&#xD;
      amount of LBM accrued during megestrol acetate therapy. This study will determine whether&#xD;
      anabolic potential can be realized when caloric intake is increased in the absence of&#xD;
      concomitant hypogonadism.&#xD;

      This is a 24 week study consisting of a 12 week double blind, randomized comparison Phase II&#xD;
      trial of megestrol acetate and testosterone enanthate in combination versus megestrol acetate&#xD;
      plus testosterone enanthate placebo in HIV associated wasting and a 12 week open label follow&#xD;
