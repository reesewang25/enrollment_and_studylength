      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary habits in middle-aged individuals are associated with increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Studies examining this association typically have assessed physical&#xD;
      activity participation in a narrow window, (for example, 1 week or 1 month) relative to&#xD;
      probable disease etiology and progression. When the study was initiated, the possible&#xD;
      relation of long-term physical activity patterns over decades or a lifetime to disease risk&#xD;
      was not known because there existed no validated method of determining such exposure, but&#xD;
      such studies were needed. It was hypothesized that validation of long-term recall of activity&#xD;
      could lead to the application of lifetime physical activity patterns questionnaires. Data on&#xD;
      lifetime activity patterns might be useful in case-comparison and prospective studies of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyzed for this project were from a cohort that had been under observation in the&#xD;
      Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study. Baseline preventive medical examinations were given to&#xD;
      6,902 men and women during the interval from 1971-1982. Current physical activity and&#xD;
      physical fitness levels (maximal exercise treadmill test) were assessed at baseline.&#xD;
      Participants also completed a lifetime physical activity pattern questionnaire as part of a&#xD;
      mail survey done in 1986. Self-reported physical activity from the 1986 questionnaire was&#xD;
      used to categorize participants' physical activity levels for the years 1971-1985. These&#xD;
      recalled levels of activity were compared to physical activity and physical fitness levels&#xD;
      assessed during those same years at the baseline examinations (measure of truth). For&#xD;
      example, participants who reported in the 1986 survey that they engaged in relatively high&#xD;
      levels of physical activity in 1976 were expected to have recorded higher levels of physical&#xD;
      fitness at the 1976 examination than participants who reported in 1986 that they were&#xD;
      relatively sedentary in 1976. The study design permitted evaluation of how accurately&#xD;
      participants recalled their physical activity up to 15 years in the past and allowed&#xD;
      quantification of the errors investigators might expect from such assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
