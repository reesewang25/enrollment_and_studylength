      To evaluate, in asymptomatic and symptomatic participants with peripheral arterial disease,&#xD;
      the feasibility of recruitment and adherence, efficacy and safety of HDL-C raising along with&#xD;
      effective control of LDL-C levels, antioxidant therapy, antithrombotic therapy, and their&#xD;
      combinations.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple mechanisms are involved in the deposition of LDL-C into the arterial wall, and the&#xD;
      prevention of such deposition as well as the removal of the LDL-particles. Further, there&#xD;
      remain questions regarding what causes an existing plaque that has been stable for a long&#xD;
      period of time to become occlusive or ulcerating and what may prevent it from doing so.&#xD;
      Prevention and treatment are almost certain to become multifaceted and more complex when&#xD;
      using several complementary interventions or preventive measures concomitantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multifactorial prevention and treatment may be particularly useful in people with peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease. PAD as manifested by intermittent claudication affects about 0.5 to 1.0&#xD;
      percent of individuals above age 35, with a twofold predominance in men. There is a&#xD;
      strikingly increased incidence with age in both sexes, particularly in those above age 50.&#xD;
      Mortality in patients with intermittent claudication has been shown to be six times higher&#xD;
      than in other people of similar age and gender. The excess in mortality is primarily due to a&#xD;
      ninefold increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. Those who have asymptomatic but&#xD;
      measurable PAD (two to two-and-a-half times as many as have intermittent claudication), have&#xD;
      relative risks of about 3 and 4 for total and CVD mortality, respectively. Therefore,&#xD;
      interventions that prevent the development or progression of atherosclerotic disease or&#xD;
      reduce arterial thrombosis should reduce mortality and morbidity due to myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and stroke while favorably affecting the morbidity directly associated with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has included peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
      (PVD) in its guidelines as a risk factor in the Classification and Decision for Treatment&#xD;
      Algorithm. This means that patients who have PVD and elevated LDL-C and one other risk factor&#xD;
      such as male gender, family history, cigarette smoking, or hypertension, should have&#xD;
      appropriate dietary intervention followed by drug therapy as needed. Even with the guidelines&#xD;
      in place since the end of 1987, a survey of PVD patients referred to a major medical center&#xD;
      clinic found that very few patients were on lipid lowering therapy, either diet or drug. The&#xD;
      reason for the primary care community not modifying lipids in these high risk patients may be&#xD;
      related to lack of studies demonstrating benefit of lipid modification in those who have PVD.&#xD;
      It is anticipated that many patients with PAD will require treatment for elevated LDL-C. It&#xD;
      is not as clear whether interventions aimed at raising HDL-C will result in a slowing of&#xD;
      progression of atherosclerosis in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets have been shown to have a key role in the development of occlusive atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and thrombosis related to coronary heart disease. Inhibition of platelet function has been&#xD;
      postulated to slow progression of atherosclerosis; specifically, aspirin has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to reduce lipoprotein deposition in the arterial wall of nonhuman primates. This&#xD;
      deposition is even further reduced by the addition of a lipid lowering regimen to the&#xD;
      antiplatelet regimen. It remains unclear whether mini-dose, less intense anticoagulation is&#xD;
      the most appropriate antithrombotic therapy in people with PAD who are also receiving lipid&#xD;
      modifying agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to a control arm or to one of three treatment arms, including a&#xD;
      lipid modification arm, an antioxidant arm, and an antithrombotic arm. Patients in the lipid&#xD;
      modification arm were randomized to placebo or treated with nicotinic acid to increase HDL&#xD;
      while lowering LDL levels equally with the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase&#xD;
      inhibitor pravastatin as needed in the intervention and control groups. Patients in the&#xD;
      antioxidant arm were assigned to daily doses of 24 mg. of beta-carotene, 800 IU of vitamin E,&#xD;
      and 1.0 g of vitamin C or to placebo. Patients in the antithrombotic arm received 2 mg/day of&#xD;
      active or placebo warfarin taken daily until the fifth follow-up visit. Patients were&#xD;
      followed every six weeks after entry for one year of follow-up. The primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      study was the efficacy and safety of HDL-C raising along with effective control of LDL-C&#xD;
      levels, antioxidant therapy, antithrombotic therapy, and their combinations. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints were to determine the efficacy of the HDL-C raising arm to achieve an increase in&#xD;
      HDL-C in the treatment group while also obtaining equivalent reductions in LDL-C in the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups, to assess the dose-response of niacin on HDL-C raising, to&#xD;
      determine if the combination of low-dose warfarin plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had the&#xD;
      expected impact on the hemostatic system, to determine if combination antioxidant therapy&#xD;
      (vitamins E and C and beta carotene) led to changes in biomarkers for antioxidants, and to&#xD;
      determine the interaction of the lipid altering strategy with antioxidants for effects on&#xD;
      biomarkers for antioxidants. Screening began August 1, 1993, randomization began December 1,&#xD;
      1993 and ended December 31, 1994 with a total of 468 patients enrolled. Support for the trial&#xD;
      ended in September 1995. Data analysis continues through March 31, 1999 under contract&#xD;
      N01HC35124.&#xD;
