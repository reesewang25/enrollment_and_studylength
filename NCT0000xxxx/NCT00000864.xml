  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerance, and metabolism of&#xD;
      single-dose and multiple-dose abacavir (ABC) in HIV-exposed infants receiving standard&#xD;
      postnatal treatment with zidovudine (ZDV). This study also evaluates the correct dosages of&#xD;
      ABC to be used in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early aggressive therapy may be the best chance to slow disease progression in infants who&#xD;
      may have been infected with HIV by their mothers. Early HIV suppression may significantly&#xD;
      reduce viral levels and allow for restoration of the immune system, providing improved&#xD;
      control over HIV infection. Therefore, it is important that the safety and tolerance of ABC&#xD;
      in combination with ZDV be examined as potential early therapy in newborn and young infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for investigation of this agent is to define the safety and pharmacokinetics in&#xD;
      young infants to allow for investigation of the efficacy of this agent in combination with&#xD;
      ZDV as potential early therapy in newborn and young infants. The rationale for early&#xD;
      aggressive therapy is that this may be the best chance to significantly reduce the long-term&#xD;
      progression and subsequent impact of HIV-1 infection in vertically infected infants. Early&#xD;
      ablation or enhanced suppression of HIV-1 replication may significantly reduce total viral&#xD;
      load and may allow maturation, preservation, or reconstruction of immune function at a stage&#xD;
      early in infection providing improved control of HIV-1 infection and reduced disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into 3 sections, as follows: Part 1A is a single-dose study in neonates&#xD;
      0 to 72 hours of age. If four of four patients reach the minimal therapeutic level with less&#xD;
      than Grade 3 toxicity, the ABC dose is escalated. Part 1B is also a single-dose study in&#xD;
      infants 21 to 28 days of age, starting with the dose identified in Part 1A. If four of four&#xD;
      patients reach the minimal therapeutic level with less than Grade 3 toxicity, the dose is&#xD;
      escalated again. Finally, Part 2 is a multi-dose study to examine a dosing regimen for ABC&#xD;
      and ZDV for neonates 0 to 72 hours of age. The dosing regimen for ABC is the dose defined in&#xD;
      Part 1A for the first 3 weeks (0 to 3 weeks of age) followed by the dose defined in Part 1B&#xD;
      for the second 3 weeks (3 to 6 weeks of age). All patients receive 6 weeks of standard ZDV&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/24/97: This study is divided into sections, as follows: Part 1A is a&#xD;
      single-dose study in neonates 0 to 48 hours of age. ABC dose escalations are made until a&#xD;
      dose is identified that meets toxicity guidelines and demonstrates a minimal target area&#xD;
      under the concentration curve (AUC) of 2,000 ng-hr/ml. Part 1B is a similar single-dose study&#xD;
      in infants 3 to 7 days of age with escalation as per part 1A. Part 1C is an identical&#xD;
      single-dose study in infants 21 to 28 days of age but starting at the dose identified in Part&#xD;
      1B. Part 2 is a multi-dose study to examine a 6-week dosing regimen for ABC and ZDV for&#xD;
      infants 0 to 48 hours of age. The dosing regimen for ABC is defined in Part 1A for the first&#xD;
      48 hours of life, the dose defined in Part 1B for Days 3 through 20 of life, and the dose&#xD;
      defined in Part 1C for Days 21 through 42 of life.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/29/98: Enrollment to&#xD;
      Parts 1A and 1B will remain open; Part 1A will enroll a minimum of 4 patients as planned, and&#xD;
      Part 1B will enroll 3 additional patients.]&#xD;
