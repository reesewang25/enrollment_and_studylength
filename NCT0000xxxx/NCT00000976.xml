  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety profile of recombinant human CD4-immunoglobulin G (CD4-IgG) and&#xD;
      zidovudine (AZT) combination therapy in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC); to&#xD;
      assess pharmacokinetic (blood level) properties of CD4-IgG in combination with AZT; and to&#xD;
      obtain preliminary indication of the antiviral and immunologic effects of CD4-IgG in&#xD;
      combination with AZT in patients with AIDS and ARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of AIDS has been directed toward the underlying retroviral infection as well as&#xD;
      toward specific opportunistic infections and malignancies that are associated with the&#xD;
      syndrome. The most extensively studied drugs are reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as AZT&#xD;
      and other nucleoside analogs, including didanosine (ddI) and dideoxycytidine (ddC). The most&#xD;
      extensive clinical experience has been achieved with AZT. These clinical trials indicated a&#xD;
      decreased incidence of opportunistic infection and increased survival in patients with AIDS.&#xD;
      However, AZT treatment is associated with dose-limiting toxicities. Additionally,&#xD;
      identification of resistance to AZT has increased the need to test the effectiveness of AZT&#xD;
      in combination with other drugs. CD4-IgG is capable of binding to HIV envelope protein&#xD;
      (gp120) and inhibiting HIV infectivity in test tube studies. Potential therapeutic benefit in&#xD;
      patients with HIV infection may be derived from CD4-IgG.&#xD;

      AMENDED: Previously, rCD4-IgG had been administered on a mcg/kg basis. Subjects now receive&#xD;
      rCD4-IgG as a fixed dose. Changes to the maintenance schedule were made to accommodate the&#xD;
      new dosages. Original design: This study is divided into two parts: A pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      evaluation, and a safety evaluation. The pharmacokinetic evaluation is done in selected&#xD;
      patients. For the safety evaluation patients will receive rCD4-IgG at a fixed dose level&#xD;
      twice weekly by intravenous bolus injection (over 1 minute) for 12 weeks. Zidovudine (AZT) is&#xD;
      administered orally 3 times daily at one of two dose levels. Eight subjects, at least 4 of&#xD;
      whom with p24 levels greater than 75 pg/m, are entered at each dose level of CD4-IgG&#xD;
      beginning with dose level 1. If 3 or more patients at a dose level experience grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      toxicity then no further patients will be added to that or higher dose levels.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of CD4-IgG alone and in combination with AZT is evaluated in patients at&#xD;
      dose level 2 only. Patients receive one IV bolus of CD4-IgG on day 1 and samples are drawn&#xD;
      beginning 15-30 minutes prior to the CD4-IgG injection. There is an 8 day washout period.&#xD;
      Beginning on day 9 and continuing through day 24, patients receive AZT daily. CD4-IgG is&#xD;
      administered by IV bolus on day 16. Samples are drawn beginning 15-30 minutes prior to the&#xD;
      injection of CD4-IgG. The pharmacokinetic evaluation terminates 8 days after the second&#xD;
      CD4-IgG injection (day 24). Extended treatment will be made available to patients at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
