  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human heart is divided into four chambers. One of the four chambers, the left ventricle,&#xD;
      is the chamber mainly responsible for pumping blood out of the heart into the circulation.&#xD;
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetically inherited disease causing an abnormal thickening&#xD;
      of heart muscle, especially the muscle making up the left ventricle. When the left ventricle&#xD;
      becomes abnormally large, it is called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HCM can be born with an enlarged left ventricle or they may develop the&#xD;
      condition in childhood or adolescence, usually during the time when the body is rapidly&#xD;
      growing. However, not all patients with the abnormal genes linked to HCM have the&#xD;
      characteristic LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is impossible to tell if a patient with the genes for HCM will develop LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently developed ultrasound tool called an integrated backscatter analysis (IBS), may&#xD;
      allow researchers to determine those children who may later develop HCM and LVH. In order to&#xD;
      test this, researchers plan to use IBS to study normal children with relatives diagnosed with&#xD;
      HCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the results of IBS done on normal children with relatives diagnosed&#xD;
      with HCM , normal children, and children with evidence enlarged heart muscle (HCM).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetically inherited disease that is characterized by&#xD;
      unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) often associated with diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      and myocardial ischemia. In patients with HCM, LVH may be present at birth or it may develop&#xD;
      during childhood and adolescence, usually during periods of rapid body growth. Currently, it&#xD;
      is not possible to identify, using clinical or laboratory methods, those children who will&#xD;
      develop LVH from among those with a genetic predisposition for the disease. It would&#xD;
      therefore be beneficial to find predictors of LVH development in normal children who have&#xD;
      family history of HCM. Integrated backscatter analysis (IBS) is a recently developed&#xD;
      ultrasound tool that has been studied in patients with various cardiac diseases. Integrated&#xD;
      myocardial backscatter has been shown to vary throughout the cardiac cycle in normal&#xD;
      subjects, both pediatric and adult, with peak values occurring during diastole and minimum&#xD;
      values in end systole. Several studies in both children and adults with HCM have shown a&#xD;
      blunting of this variation in backscatter analysis. We hypothesize that patients with a&#xD;
      genetic predisposition for HCM, but no echocardiographic evidence of the disease, may have a&#xD;
      greater prevalence of alterations in integrated myocardial backscatter when compared to&#xD;
      children without a family history of HCM. We therefore propose to examine the cyclic&#xD;
      variation of integrated myocardial backscatter in children with a normal echocardiogram and a&#xD;
      first-degree relative with HCM, and compare it with the results obtained in a group of normal&#xD;
      children, as well as in a group of children with unequivocal echocardiographic evidence of&#xD;
      HCM.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Three groups of subjects (aged 1-15 years) will be studied: normal children, children with&#xD;
        HCM, and children that are family members of patients with HCM, but do not themselves have&#xD;
        any evidence of LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CONTROL GROUP (NORM GROUP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal children under the age of 15 who have a normal two-dimensional echocardiogram will&#xD;
        be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY GROUP (HCM GROUP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with HCM (unexplained LVH on two-dimensional echocardiogram) under the age of 15&#xD;
        will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family History of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Group (FHCM GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal children under the age of 15 who have a first-degree relative with HCM and a normal&#xD;
        two-dimensional echocardiogram will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - CONTROL GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will be any historical or echocardiographic evidence of congenital or&#xD;
        valvular heart disease or any form of cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - HCM GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will be any evidence of congenital or valvular heart disease that may&#xD;
        explain the presence of LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - FHCM GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will be any historical or echocardiographic evidence of congenital or&#xD;
        valvular heart disease or other form of cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
