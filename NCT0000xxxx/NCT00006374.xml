      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not&#xD;
      yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective for treating&#xD;
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combining topotecan and&#xD;
      paclitaxel with that of combining etoposide and cisplatin in treating patients who have&#xD;
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the response rates in patients with extensive stage small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer treated with topotecan and paclitaxel versus etoposide and cisplatin. II. Compare time&#xD;
      to response, response duration, time to progression, and survival in these patients treated&#xD;
      with these regimens. III. Determine the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these&#xD;
      patients. IV. Compare the effects of these regimens on symptoms of disease in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to gender, ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), and elevated LDH (absent vs&#xD;
      present). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive&#xD;
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Patients&#xD;
      also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood&#xD;
      counts recover. Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours on day 1 and etoposide IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
