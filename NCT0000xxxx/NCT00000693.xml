  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the use of acyclovir (ACV) and zidovudine (AZT) in the treatment of cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS who would otherwise be treated with ganciclovir (DHPG)&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV retinitis is one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. DHPG&#xD;
      is at present the only drug available for widespread compassionate use in the United States.&#xD;
      Although most patients respond to treatment with DHPG, the medication does not cure the&#xD;
      infection. Most patients will have a relapse and will require retreatment with DHPG. Because&#xD;
      of the large relapse rate, most people treated for CMV retinitis are placed on continuous&#xD;
      treatment with DHPG. There are two major problems associated with ongoing use of DHPG: 1) The&#xD;
      development of a low white blood cell (WBC) count (leukopenia) which is a known side effect&#xD;
      of the drug; and 2) the increased risk for leukopenia when DHPG is given together with AZT,&#xD;
      the only antiviral drug currently available for the treatment of HIV infection. Therefore,&#xD;
      patients cannot take both AZT and DHPG at the same time because the bone marrow toxicity is&#xD;
      made much more severe when the drugs are given together. This has resulted in the difficult&#xD;
      decision as to whether to forgo potential life-extending therapy with AZT in order to&#xD;
      preserve sight. An effective treatment for CMV retinitis is needed that will allow the&#xD;
      patient to also take AZT. ACV is presently the drug of choice for severe herpes virus&#xD;
      infections. It has been shown to be effective in suppressing severe CMV disease in patients&#xD;
      who have received bone marrow transplants.&#xD;

      who have received bone marrow transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ACV intravenously and AZT orally for 12 weeks. Tolerance of the combined&#xD;
      administration of ACV and AZT is monitored. AMENDED: AZT dose lowered and inclusion of&#xD;
      concurrent medication expanded.&#xD;
