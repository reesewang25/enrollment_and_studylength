      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether differences in dietary habits are associated with disease&#xD;
      activity in patients with acute intermittent porphyria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether premenstrual porphyria attacks are associated with increased luteal&#xD;
      phase energy requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether energy requirements are higher than intakes in men with unexplained&#xD;
      frequent porphyria attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the nutritional status of women with acute intermittent porphyria using a&#xD;
      comprehensive series of laboratory methods, including zinc and pyridoxine status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine whether the frequency of disease exacerbations decreases when dietary and&#xD;
      nutritional abnormalities are corrected in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of a parenteral nutrition regimen for patients with&#xD;
      acute porphyria attacks.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Women record diet intake for at least 1 cycle (28 days), then undergo a&#xD;
      comprehensive nutritional assessment at least once during the follicular and luteal phases of&#xD;
      the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men also record diet intake for at least 1 month and undergo indirect calorimetry and other&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive a comprehensive analysis of diet and energy metabolism. Energy&#xD;
      expenditure, resting metabolic rates, and basal metabolic rates are determined with indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry, including measurements taken during the follicular and luteal phases of the&#xD;
      cycle. Other testing includes hormone assays, serology for nutritional studies, and a urinary&#xD;
      metabolite profile. Zinc, lead, and other metals are measured by atomic absorption&#xD;
      spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria is confirmed by erythrocyte porphobilinogen&#xD;
      deaminase; urinary aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and porphyrins; and total fecal&#xD;
      porphyrins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized for acute attacks of porphyria during the study will receive standard&#xD;
      treatment, including intravenous hematin and parenteral support.&#xD;
