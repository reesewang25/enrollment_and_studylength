      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Hydration with saline solution may protect kidney cells from the&#xD;
      side effects of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of glufosfamide with or without&#xD;
      hydration in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of glufosfamide as determined by objective response in&#xD;
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the response rate in this patient&#xD;
      population after this treatment. III. Determine the duration of objective response in these&#xD;
      patients treated with this drug. IV. Characterize the toxicities of this drug in these&#xD;
      patients. V. Assess the impact of the hydration scheme on the toxicity profile (renal&#xD;
      function) of this drug in these patients. VI. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to&#xD;
      receive glufosfamide with or without hydration. Arm I: Patients receive glufosfamide IV over&#xD;
      1 hour every 3 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive glufosfamide as in arm I. Patients are&#xD;
      hydrated with excess physiological saline solution 4 hours before and 3 hours after treatment&#xD;
      with glufosfamide. Treatment in both arms continues for 2-6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with an objective complete response&#xD;
      continue treatment for a maximum of 2 courses after the confirmation of response. Patients&#xD;
      are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-32 patients (8-16 per arm) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
