      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can locate tumor cells and either kill&#xD;
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cetuximab and irinotecan in treating&#xD;
      patients who have advanced colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and partial response rates and time to progression in&#xD;
      patients with refractory advanced colorectal carcinoma treated with cetuximab and irinotecan.&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety and toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the tumor epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor levels in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by response to irinotecan based&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen (stable disease vs disease progression). Patients receive a test dose of&#xD;
      cetuximab IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients who do not experience grade 4 anaphylactic&#xD;
      reaction receive a loading dose of cetuximab IV over 2 hours beginning 30 minutes after&#xD;
      completion of test dose. Patients receive maintenance cetuximab IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15,&#xD;
      22, 29, and 36. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes (beginning 1 hour after&#xD;
      completion of cetuximab infusion) at the same regimen (dosage and frequency) on which the&#xD;
      patient became refractory to irinotecan therapy. Irinotecan is administered at a higher dose&#xD;
      on days 1 and 22 OR at a lower dose on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity to irinotecan may continue on cetuximab maintenance therapy alone at the discretion&#xD;
      of the protocol investigator and sponsor. Quality of life is assessed before initiation of&#xD;
      study therapy, at the completion of each course, and then at 4 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      study. Patients are followed at 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 110 patients (55 per strata) will be accrued for this study&#xD;
      within 7 months.&#xD;
