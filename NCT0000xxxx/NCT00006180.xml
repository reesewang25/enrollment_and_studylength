      The purpose of this study is to determine whether women with major depression lose bone mass&#xD;
      at a faster rate than women without depression. This study will also determine if the drug&#xD;
      alendronate can maintain or increase bone mass in premenopausal women with major depression&#xD;
      and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression may be a major risk factor for osteoporosis; it is associated with abnormally&#xD;
      elevated stress hormone levels that may contribute to bone loss. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      bone mass in women with depression and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo psychiatric, medical, dietary, and stress hormone evaluations and&#xD;
      bone mineral density (BMD) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with depression will be divided into two groups: those with normal BMD and those&#xD;
      with low BMD. Depressed participants with normal BMD will be compared to a control group of&#xD;
      healthy premenopausal women with normal BMD and followed for 36 months. Dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA) determinations will be made at months 6, 12, 24 and 36; bone turnover&#xD;
      and endocrine parameters of depression will be&#xD;
&#xD;
      measured every 3 to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with depression and low BMD will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      alendronate or placebo (an inactive pill) once a week for 24 months. Participants will&#xD;
      receive calcium and vitamin D supplements daily. DEXA determinations will be performed at&#xD;
      screening, and at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24; bone turnover and endocrine parameters of&#xD;
      depression will be measured every 3 to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, up to four of the visits may optimally be done as inpatient stays of two&#xD;
      nights. All remaining visits are as outpatients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a five-year study on the natural history of bone turn-over in depressed premenopausal&#xD;
      women, ages 21 to 45 years, with normal bone mass, and the response to treatment with&#xD;
      alendronate in depressed premenopausal women, ages 21 to 45 with low bone mass (as indicated&#xD;
      by a bone mineral density (BMD) of negative 1.5 SD below peak bone mass at the spine and/or&#xD;
      hip). Osteopenia is defined as a BMD at the spine and/or hip that is between negative 1.5 and&#xD;
      negative 2.5 SD; osteoporosis is defined as a BMD that is below negative 2.5 SD at the spine&#xD;
      and/or hip. During the initial screening, the women are evaluated for depression. Women who&#xD;
      meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder as indicated by a structured&#xD;
      psychiatric interview (SCID-IV and HAM-D), will then undergo a DEXA scan to determine BMD.&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into four subcategories based on BMD results. Premenopausal&#xD;
      depressed women with normal BMD (less than negative 1 SD below the average peak bone mass at&#xD;
      the spine and/or hip) (Group B) will be matched by age, race, and body mass index to a&#xD;
      control group of healthy, premenopausal, non-depressed women with normal bone mass (Group A).&#xD;
      Groups A and B will be followed for 12 months with DEXA determinations every 6 months,&#xD;
      measurements of bone turnover markers every 3 months, measurements of relevant endocrine&#xD;
      parameters every 3 months, an exercise substudy at 0, 6, and 12 months, and collection of a&#xD;
      DNA sample at one of the above visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with depression and low BMD (negative 1.5 SD below peak bone mass at the spine and/or&#xD;
      hip) will enter a 12-month, placebo-controlled, clinical trial where they will be randomized&#xD;
      either to blind alendronate 70 mg once a week (Group C) or blind placebo once a week (Group&#xD;
      D). In addition to alendronate 70 mg once a week or placebo once a week, women in Groups C&#xD;
      and D will also receive daily 500 mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D. DEXA&#xD;
      determinations will be performed at Screening, Month 0, Month 6, and Month 12. Determination&#xD;
      of biochemical markers of bone turnover and endocrine parameters relevant to depression will&#xD;
      be performed at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. An exercise substudy will be performed at 0, 6, and&#xD;
      12 months. The collection of a DNA sample will also be performed at one of the above visits.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - DEPRESSED WOMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient is a woman 21 to 45 years old on the date of the initial screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient is not postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        She must be willing to practice an acceptable method of birth control, as appropriate (IUD,&#xD;
        oral contraceptives, diaphragm, condoms, hormonal implants/injection, with the exception of&#xD;
        subdermal levonorgestrel, sterilization) and have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
        screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women currently on estrogen/progestin contraceptive therapy must have been on a stable&#xD;
        regimen of estrogen/progestin for at least 6 months prior to enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient understands the procedures and the risks of the study and has been informed&#xD;
        that, alternatively, she may freely elect to be treated with the currently available&#xD;
        treatments by her physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient voluntarily agrees to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA RELATED TO THE PSYCHIATRIC STATUS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient had at least one episode of major depression within the last 3 years (DSM-IV).&#xD;
        In addition, the subject has a past history (prior to the last 3 years) of at least one&#xD;
        major depressive episode lasting more than 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        With the exception of depression, the patient is in good health, based on medical history,&#xD;
        physical examination, and laboratory screening evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient has a physician; either a family doctor, a psychiatrist, a psychotherapist, or&#xD;
        another qualified health care professional who can provide medical treatment for&#xD;
        depression. If the subject is not receiving any medical care for depression, a member of&#xD;
        the NIH team will help the patient identify one and will work closely with this&#xD;
        professional during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient can be on pharmacological antidepressant therapy, as medically indicated and&#xD;
        prescribed by her primary physician or health professional. It is not a requirement of this&#xD;
        study for subjects to stop antidepressant treatment, unless it is medically indicated for&#xD;
        reasons such as the medication is ineffective, not well tolerated, or the patient no longer&#xD;
        needs such treatment. This decision will be based upon their physician's evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients starting a new antidepressant medication(s) should be on this treatment for 4-6&#xD;
        weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Carbamazepine, valproic acid or thyroid hormones used as adjunctive therapy for treatment&#xD;
        of depression are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women with a current or recent (within the past 3 years) history of alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
        are eligible if, in the opinion of the principal investigator, this condition is not likely&#xD;
        to impair patient compliance or if the participation in the study does not pose additional&#xD;
        risks to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA RELATED TO THE BONE STATUS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient has spinal anatomy suitable for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)&#xD;
        densitometry of the lumbar spine, with no evidence of vertebral fractures in at least three&#xD;
        vertebrae. Significant scoliosis, bony trauma, osteoarthritis, and sequelae of orthopedic&#xD;
        procedures that result in anatomy unsuitable for accurate bone densitometry, must be absent&#xD;
        from the lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient has osteopenia or osteoporosis, as indicated by a bone mineral density at the&#xD;
        spine that is between 1.5 and 5 standard deviations below peak bone mass, or history of an&#xD;
        osteoporotic vertebral or hip fracture. Patients whose eligibility is based only on a&#xD;
        prevalent vertebral fracture will have the fracture confirmed by a radiologist.&#xD;

        continued follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient has a history of or evidence for an illness or has significant abnormalities on&#xD;
