  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a genetic epidemiologic study of the coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors of&#xD;
      blood lipids and obesity in Black and white girls who participated in the NHLBI-supported&#xD;
      National Growth and Health Study (NGHS). The study was ancillary to NGHS.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Growth and Health Study, NGHS, was an epidemiologic study of 2,379 black and&#xD;
      white girls, ages 9-10 years at entry, who were followed annually. The ancillary study had&#xD;
      the potential for identifying those genes involved in determining Black/white differences in&#xD;
      lipid metabolism and obesity. This was an exciting area in which there was virtually no&#xD;
      available information. Finally, the study permitted an examination of the effects of gene&#xD;
      variation on changes in quantitative levels of blood lipids as well as in body fat during&#xD;
      different stages of pubescence since the NGHS protocol included annual anthropometric and&#xD;
      maturation assessments and biannual blood lipid determinations along with extensive&#xD;
      environmental measures which included dietary, household, and psychosocial information. The&#xD;
      study was unique because of the rare opportunity to do genetic analyses in a large cohort of&#xD;
      two ethnic groups of children on whom a very rich data base was available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was an independent research project ancillary to the NGHS and utilized the&#xD;
      extensive biological and environmental information available from the NGHS core data base.&#xD;
      Blood samples were obtained from 1,133 girls seen at their followup examinations in Year 7 in&#xD;
      order to determine genotypes at those loci known to be implicated in lipid metabolism and&#xD;
      obesity. Both protein [apolipoproteins C-II, D, and E and LP(a)] and DNA [apolipoprotein B,&#xD;
      lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and LDL receptor] were analyzed. The distribution of genetic&#xD;
      variation within each ethnic group was determined. At each candidate gene locus, the genotype&#xD;
      effects were estimated on quantitative level of apolipoproteins and lipoproteins, and also on&#xD;
      the degree and distribution of body fat after adjusting for concomitant variables (such as&#xD;
      age, biologic maturation stage adiposity) within each ethnic group. By comparing the&#xD;
      frequencies of genotypes at candidate loci, their allelic effects were assessed as well as&#xD;
      their impact on blood lipids and obesity development in Black and white females.&#xD;
