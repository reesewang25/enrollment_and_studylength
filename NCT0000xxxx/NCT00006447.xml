      This randomized trial tested a 6 month intervention of computer network vs a control group&#xD;
      (standard care) to improve quality of life and health status for traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers. The network, termed the Trauma Recovery Support System (TRSS),&#xD;
      consisted of a central computer system connected via modem to a personal computer in the&#xD;
      caregiver's home. Users could access via the Internet special modules and communication&#xD;
      services to help them cope with their new roles as caregivers and with accompanying social&#xD;
      isolation. These modules were an on-line discussion group, an &quot;ask an expert questions&quot;&#xD;
      function, a database of previously asked questions with answers, a database of community&#xD;
      resources, and a reference library.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has long-term and often devastating impacts on a family. The&#xD;
      spouse or partner caring for an individual with TBI experiences significant emotional&#xD;
      distress, and psychological and physical morbidity. Clinical experience indicates that&#xD;
      patients with strong family support progress further than those without family involvement.&#xD;
      There is strong evidence that support provided to caregivers improves their well being, as&#xD;
      well as that of the care recipient. The trial was designed to lessen her morbidity, improve&#xD;
      her support for the TBI partner, and improve recovery of the TBI person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of a newly developed Trauma Recovery Support System (TRSS) was evaluated&#xD;
      using a randomized controlled experimental design. Sixty-four patient/caregiver pairs were&#xD;
      recruited, and those (randomly) assigned to the experimental group received access to the&#xD;
      centralized TRSS via a personal computer in their homes including access via Internet to&#xD;
      special modules and communication services to help them cope with their new roles as&#xD;
      caregivers and with accompanying social isolation. Modules consist of an on-line discussion&#xD;
      group, an &quot;ask an expert questions&quot; function, a database of previously asked questions with&#xD;
      answers, a database of community resources, and a reference library. Controls received&#xD;
      standard care. All participants (experimental and control) were interviewed at 0, 3, and 6&#xD;
      months from time of patient discharge, initially in person and later by phone to evaluate the&#xD;
      status of the caregiver (quality of life and health status) and TBI patient recovery.&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and other background data was collected.&#xD;
