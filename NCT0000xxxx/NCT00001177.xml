  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and describe the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome&#xD;
      (PMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who experience PMS symptoms will complete clinical interviews, self-rating scales, and&#xD;
      evaluations of mood and endocrine function. A subgroup of women with severe PMS (Premenstrual&#xD;
      Dysphoric Disorder or PMDD) will be offered additional research studies that focus on: 1)&#xD;
      identifying the endocrine changes that may be responsible for changes in mood and behavior&#xD;
      during the premenstrual period, 2) evaluating treatments for PMS symptoms, and/or 3)&#xD;
      identifying genetic factors in women with and without PMS. Women with recurrent brief&#xD;
      depression will also be recruited to serve as a comparison group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this screening protocol is to identify a population of women who experience&#xD;
      menstrually-related mood or behavior difficulties and to describe the symptoms in this group&#xD;
      and their relationship to the menses. This will be accomplished by means of clinical&#xD;
      interviews, self-rating scales, and periodic evaluation of mood and endocrine function. We&#xD;
      further wish to identify and recruit a subgroup of women with menstrually-related mood&#xD;
      disorder for participation in specific neuroendocrine/neurophysiologic studies (companion&#xD;
      protocols) in an attempt to identify endocrinologic or physiologic measures that might: 1) be&#xD;
      associated with the discrete changes in mood and behavior; 2) distinguish this group from a&#xD;
      group of age-matched controls; 3) allow for further subgroup definition on the basis of&#xD;
      predicted response to pharmacological intervention. Finally, we wish to identify a group of&#xD;
      women with recurrent brief depression, who will serve as an additional control group for the&#xD;
      patients with menstrual cycle-related mood disorders.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects of this study will be women who meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history within the last two years of at least six months with menstrually-related mood&#xD;
             or behavioral disturbances of at least moderate severity - that is, disturbances that&#xD;
             are distinct in appearance and associated with a notable degree of subjective&#xD;
             distress;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a 30% increase in mean negative mood ratings (relative to the range of the scale&#xD;
             employed) in the premenstrual week compared with the week following the end of menses&#xD;
             in at least two of three cycles;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age 18 to 50;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not pregnant and in good medical health;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  regular menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For subjects with recurrent brief depression:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  dysphoric mood or loss of interest or pleasure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  duration less than two weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  four of the following symptoms: poor appetite or significant weight loss (when not&#xD;
             dieting) or increased appetite or significant weight gain; insomnia or hypersomnia;&#xD;
             psychomotor agitation or retardation; loss of interest or pleasure in usual&#xD;
             activities, or decrease in sexual drive; loss of energy; fatigue; feelings of&#xD;
             worthlessness, self-reproach, or excessive or inappropriate guilt; diminished ability&#xD;
             to think or concentrate, slowed thinking, or indecisiveness;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  impairment in usual occupational activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at least one-two episodes per month over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age-matched women without mood and behavioral disorders will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA for all study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should have no general medical illness that is primary (i.e., appears to be&#xD;
             causing the mood disorder);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current antidepressant therapy (since this is a screening protocol for subsequent&#xD;
             treatment and physiologic evaluation studies in which participants must be untreated).&#xD;
             Antidepressants will not be withheld from participants who need or want them;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current alcohol or substance use or dependence (excluding nicotine) of sufficient&#xD;
             magnitude to require independent, concurrent treatment intervention (e.g., antabuse or&#xD;
             opiate treatment, but not including self-help groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NIMH employees/staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the&#xD;
             study per NIMH policy.&#xD;
