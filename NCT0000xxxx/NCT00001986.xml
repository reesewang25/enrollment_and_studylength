  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the food additive 1-octanol for&#xD;
      treating essential tremor. This disorder, which is an involuntary shaking, usually of the&#xD;
      hands, has no satisfactory treatment. It affects more than one of every 100 people in the&#xD;
      general population, with the figure climbing to nearly 4 in every hundred among people over&#xD;
      40 years old. In animal studies, 1-octanol reduced chemically induced tremors in rats. This&#xD;
      study will test the effects of the accepted daily intake of 1-octanol (1 milligram per&#xD;
      kilogram of body weight) on essential tremor in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with essential tremor 21 years old and older who wish to enroll in this study will&#xD;
      undergo eligibility screening with a medical history and physical examination that includes&#xD;
      tests for thyroid, liver and kidney problems. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either 1-octanol or a placebo (an inactive substance). Patients in both groups will&#xD;
      have an intravenous catheter (a thin, plastic tube) placed in an arm vein for collecting&#xD;
      blood samples during the study. Those in the 1-octanol group will be given a 1-octanol&#xD;
      capsule; the placebo group will receive a look-alike capsule containing no active ingredient.&#xD;
      Neither the patient nor the doctor will know which patients are taking 1-octanol or placebo&#xD;
      until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremors will be measured once before the catheter is placed, every 15 minutes during the&#xD;
      first 2 hours after taking the capsule, twice during the third hour (30 minutes apart), and&#xD;
      once again after 5 hours. The tremors are measured using procedures called accelerometry and&#xD;
      surface electromyography. For these procedures, electrodes are taped to the skin; needles are&#xD;
      not used. Blood samples will be collected once before taking the capsule, every 15 minutes&#xD;
      for the first hour and a half after taking the capsule and again at 2 hours, 4 hours and 5&#xD;
      hours after taking the capsule. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate)&#xD;
      will be measured every 15 minutes during the first 2 hours of taking the capsule, every 30&#xD;
      minutes during the third hour, and again at 4 hours and 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital overnight for observation and return after 3 days for&#xD;
      a follow-up physical examination, including a blood test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder; however, there is currently no&#xD;
      satisfactory drug treatment. The neural mechanisms underlying ET remain unknown. One of the&#xD;
      prevalent hypotheses is that ET is a result of a defective mechanism that normally dampens&#xD;
      the natural oscillations of inferior olive (IO) neurons whose intrinsic oscillatory activity&#xD;
      is attributed to the presence of low threshold calcium channels (LTCC). 1-Octanol is known to&#xD;
      inhibit LTCC of olivary neurons and was found to reduce the tremor induced in rats with&#xD;
      harmaline, an alkaloid known to hyperpolarize IO neurons increasing their tendency to fire&#xD;
      rhythmically at rest. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of 1-octanol on ET in&#xD;
      humans. This study is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose trial in&#xD;
      untreated patients with ET. Electromyography (EMG) and acclerometry are used to assess tremor&#xD;
      before and after 1-octanol administration. The accepted daily intake (ADI) of 1-octanol (1&#xD;
      mg/kg/d) as a food additive will be given as a single dose. Toxicity from octanol will be&#xD;
      monitored clinically and by liver function and electrolyte measurements.&#xD;
