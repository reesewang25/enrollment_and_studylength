  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether taking protease inhibitors (anti-HIV drugs)&#xD;
      together with lipid-lowering drugs (drugs which lower the amount of fat in the blood) has an&#xD;
      effect on the level of drugs found in the blood compared to when these drugs are taken&#xD;
      separately. The three protease inhibitors given in this study are ritonavir, saquinavir, and&#xD;
      nelfinavir. The lipid-lowering drugs given are pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-HIV drug therapy using protease inhibitors has become very common treatment for&#xD;
      HIV-positive patients. Recently, however, serious side effects involving how the body uses&#xD;
      fat have been reported in people taking protease inhibitors. Examples of these side effects&#xD;
      are redistribution of body fat and development of diabetes. People taking protease inhibitors&#xD;
      have been found to have higher levels of fat in their blood than is normal, which can cause&#xD;
      heart problems. It is hoped that giving lipid-lowering drugs can help prevent serious heart&#xD;
      problems. First, however, it is important to see what happens when protease inhibitors and&#xD;
      lipid-lowering drugs are given together.&#xD;

      Potent antiretroviral therapy has become the standard of care for persons with HIV infection&#xD;
      and AIDS. Recently, however, a number of complications have emerged with the widespread use&#xD;
      of protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens, including: hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, and lipodystrophy. Concern over the possibility of premature myocardial&#xD;
      infarction has led health care providers and patients to consider treating these lipid&#xD;
      metabolism disorders. Statin compounds have beneficial effects as lipid-lowering agents, and&#xD;
      thereby reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. Statin compounds such as&#xD;
      pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin are increasingly being prescribed in persons&#xD;
      taking PI-based potent antiretroviral therapy. It is important to determine whether there are&#xD;
      significant drug-drug interactions between the statin compounds and PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourteen healthy participants for each cohort of Arm A are stabilized on a fixed regimen of&#xD;
      pravastatin (Arm A1), simvastatin (Arm A2), or atorvastatin (Arm A3) for 4 days. A baseline&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation is completed on Day 4. Pravastatin (or simvastatin or&#xD;
      atorvastatin) dosing stops following the Day 4 dose and PK evaluation. On Day 5, a ritonavir&#xD;
      and saquinavir combination regimen is initiated and continued through Day 18 of the study.&#xD;
      Pravastatin (or simvastatin or atorvastatin) dosing resumes on Day 15 and continues through&#xD;
      Day 18. A repeat PK evaluation of pravastatin (or simvastatin or atorvastatin) in the context&#xD;
      of combination therapy is carried out on Day 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourteen healthy participants are assigned to Arm B; these participants begin a 2-week&#xD;
      regimen of nelfinavir. On Day 14, a baseline PK profile of nelfinavir and its M8 metabolite&#xD;
      is carried out. Pravastatin is then added to the regimen for Days 15 to 18. On Day 18, a&#xD;
      repeat PK evaluation of nelfinavir and the M8 metabolite is carried out in the context of&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;
