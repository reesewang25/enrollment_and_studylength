  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of an experimental drug called NS2330 on Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of&#xD;
      long-term treatment with levodopa. This drug prevents the neurotransmitter dopamine from&#xD;
      entering nerve cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 75 years old who have moderately advanced Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      motor problems resulting from levodopa therapy may be eligible for this 5-week study.&#xD;
      Candidates will have a complete medical history and physical examination with a detailed&#xD;
      neurological evaluation. If needed, some patients will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain and a chest X-ray. All patients will&#xD;
      have blood and urine tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG) and will take a written test for&#xD;
      evaluation of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will, if possible, stop taking all antiparkinson medications&#xD;
      except levodopa (Sinemet) for one month before the study begins and through its duration. For&#xD;
      the first 1 to 3 days, patients will undergo a levodopa &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this&#xD;
      study, patients will stop taking their usual oral levodopa medicine and instead will have&#xD;
      levodopa infused through a vein for up to 12 hours. During the infusions, the drug dose will&#xD;
      be increased slowly until either 1) parkinsonism symptoms improve, 2) dyskinesias appear, 3)&#xD;
      unacceptable side effects occur, or 4) the maximum study dose is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient's optimal dose is determined, treatment will begin. Patients will take three&#xD;
      pills containing NS2330 or placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient) 3 days a&#xD;
      week for up to 5 weeks, in addition to their regular levodopa medication. All participants&#xD;
      will receive placebo at some point in the study; some patients will receive only placebo&#xD;
      throughout the entire 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On treatment days, patients will have a brief medical examination before receiving the drug&#xD;
      and will then be monitored for side effects for about 6 to 8 hours after taking the drug. At&#xD;
      the beginning of weeks 2 and 5, the levodopa infusions will be repeated at the previously&#xD;
      determined optimum rate. Throughout the study, parkinsonism symptoms, dyskinesias and&#xD;
      depression will be evaluated. Blood and urine samples will be collected each week for&#xD;
      standard safety tests, and blood will also be drawn periodically to measure NS2330 levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of a potent inhibitor of&#xD;
      dopamine reuptake on the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor&#xD;
      response complications in patients with Parkinson's disease. In a controlled&#xD;
      proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of NS2330 will be assessed through the use of&#xD;
      validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent clinical&#xD;
      evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and Females are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ages 18-75.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women must be at least one year post-menopausal or using an adequate contraceptive method&#xD;
        for at least one month prior to and during participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All will carry the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease based on the presence of a&#xD;
        characteristic clinical history and neurologic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All will have relatively advanced disease with levodopa-associated motor response&#xD;
        complications, including wearing-off fluctuations and peak-dose dyskinesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject&#xD;
        the patient to unwarranted risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities including liver enzyme elevations more&#xD;
        than twice the upper limit of normal, or neutropenia (wbc less than 4000).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with diphasic or end-of dose dyskinesias or disabling dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are unable to be treated with levodopa/carbidopa alone or a single, relatively&#xD;
        short-acting dopamine agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any form of Parkinsonism other than idiopathic PD or with a diagnosis of&#xD;
        dementia or major psychiatric disorder. Individuals with mild to moderate depression will&#xD;
        be sought for this study, unless their depressive disorder currently requires regular&#xD;
        medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are on unacceptable prior/concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients with prior bilateral neurosurgical intervention for the treatment of Parkinsonian&#xD;
        symptoms, i.e. deep brain stimulation, pallidotomy, fetal tissue transplantation as well as&#xD;
        patients at risk for symptomatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and/or myocardial&#xD;
        ischemia secondary to intravenous levodopa challenge or NS2330 therapy.&#xD;

        Patients who have taken an investigational drug within the last two months prior to&#xD;
        randomization.&#xD;
