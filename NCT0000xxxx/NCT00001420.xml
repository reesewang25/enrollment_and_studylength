  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the genetic and immune factors involved in the cause and development&#xD;
      of psoriatic arthritis-a disease of both the skin and joints. It will describe the medical&#xD;
      features and natural course of the disease and determine participants' eligibility for&#xD;
      experimental treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with known or suspected psoriatic arthritis 5 years of age and older and their&#xD;
      relatives may enroll in this study. Patients will be evaluated with a medical history and&#xD;
      physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood tests and X-rays. Additional procedures may&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Leukapheresis-Collection of white blood cells for genetic analysis. Whole blood is&#xD;
           collected through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine&#xD;
           that separates it into its components. The plasma is removed and the cells are returned&#xD;
           to the body through a second needle placed in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin biopsy-Removal of a small skin sample for microscopic analysis. An area of skin is&#xD;
           numbed with an anesthetic and one to three small circular portions (about 1/4 inch in&#xD;
           diameter) are cut and removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Joint aspiration-Removal of a small sample of synovial fluid (lubricating joint fluid).&#xD;
           An area of skin around the biopsy site is numbed with an anesthetic, and a needle is&#xD;
           inserted into the joint to pull out a small fluid sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Synovial needle biopsy-Removal of a small sample of synovial tissue (tissue lining the&#xD;
           joint). An area of skin around the biopsy site is numbed with an anesthetic and a large&#xD;
           needle is inserted into the joint. A smaller needle attached to a syringe is then placed&#xD;
           inside the larger needle and small pieces of synovial tissue are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Genetic studies-Saliva and blood samples will be collected for gene testing. Saliva is&#xD;
           collected by rinsing the mouth with a tablespoon of salt water and spitting into a test&#xD;
           tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed once or twice a year and may be evaluated for participation in an&#xD;
      experimental treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating relatives of patients will fill out a brief medical history questionnaire and&#xD;
      provide a DNA sample (blood sample or tissue swab from the inside of the cheek).&#xD;

      Patients with known or suspected psoriatic arthritis will be evaluated at the Clinical&#xD;
      Center. Studies will include characterization of the clinical and laboratory features of the&#xD;
      disease, research studies of the natural history and pathogenesis, genetic studies, and&#xD;
      determination of the patient's eligibility to enter experimental therapeutic protocols.&#xD;
      Patients may be asked to contribute blood, skin or synovial membrane samples for immunologic&#xD;
      and genetic research studies.&#xD;
