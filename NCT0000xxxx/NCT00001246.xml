      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unlike X-rays and CT-scans does not use radiation to create&#xD;
      a picture. MRI use as the name implies, magnetism to create pictures with excellent&#xD;
      anatomical resolution. Functional MRIs are diagnostic tests that allow doctors to not only&#xD;
      view anatomy, but physiology and function. It is for these reasons that MRIs are excellent&#xD;
      methods for studying the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will use MRI to assess brain anatomy and function in X and Y&#xD;
      chromosome variation, healthy volunteers, and patients with a variety of childhood onset&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. The disorders include attention deficit disorder, autism, congenital&#xD;
      adrenal hyperplasia, childhood-onset schizophrenia, dyslexia, obsessive compulsive disorder,&#xD;
      Sydenham's chorea, and Tourette's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the MRIs showing the anatomy of the brain and brain function will be compared&#xD;
      across age, sex (gender), and diagnostic groups. Correlations between brain and behavioral&#xD;
      measures will be examined for normal and clinical populations.&#xD;

      Objective: Our work is driven by the core hypotheses that many of the most severe&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood onset are associated with deviations from the path of&#xD;
      normal brain development, the neuroanatomical substrates of which can be detected by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging. Consequently, the long-term goals of the protocol are to: (1) map&#xD;
      neuroanatomic and neurophysiological trajectories of brain development in health and illness;&#xD;
      and (2) discern influences on those trajectories from demographic (e.g. age and sex),&#xD;
      cognitive/behavioral (e.g. IQ), and clinical (e.g. presence/absence of a known neurogenetic&#xD;
      disorders) factors. Data from the project have resulted in seminal papers on&#xD;
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Childhood-Onset Schizophrenia, and typical&#xD;
      pediatric brain development. The biological bases of male / female differences are explored&#xD;
      via studies of subjects with anomalous sex chromosome numbers (e.g. XO, XXX, XYY, XXYY,&#xD;
      XXXXY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Our studies include data from typically developing youth, and individuals&#xD;
      with a range of psychiatric presentations from behaviorally-defined (e.g. Childhood-Onset&#xD;
      Schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder) as well as genetically-defined (e.g. Sex Chromosome&#xD;
      Aneuploidy) groups. Participants span a wide age range (from 3 years of age upwards).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study design is to have participants come to the NIH for brain imaging,&#xD;
      psychological/psychiatric testing, and genetic characterization. Assessment visits each take&#xD;
      approximately 2 days to complete. Participants are invited to return for longitudinal&#xD;
      assessments (at approximately 2-year intervals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure used to date have derived from T1-weighted&#xD;
      structural neuroimaging data which enable us to characterize how a range of anatomical brain&#xD;
      phenotypes vary as a function of age, sex, behavioral/cognitive traits, diagnostic status and&#xD;
      genotype. Analyses also consider how these factors relate to other outcomes of interest&#xD;
      including; gene expression levels, functional metrics from in vivo neuroimaging, and&#xD;
      questionnaire/interview-based assessment of clinical features.&#xD;

                  Syndrome, normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Androgen Insensitivity&#xD;
                  Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ADHD&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Down s Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly enrolled adults and minors once they become adults over age 18 who cannot give&#xD;
             consent due to limited capacity may have a surrogate, i.e., a legally responsible&#xD;
             representative (LAR), sign the consent. LARs include DPA holders, court-appointed&#xD;
             legal guardians, or parents or siblings over 18 years of age. We will consult with the&#xD;
             Human Subjects Protection Unit as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ADHD PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defined&#xD;
        ADHD. The DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD will be based on the Parent Diagnostic Interview for&#xD;
        Children and Adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Conners Teacher Hyperactivity rating greater than 2 SD above age- and sex-specific means.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR DOWN SYNDROME PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed chromosomal diagnosis of Down syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age at entry into the study is 30 years or under. This upper age limit at study entry&#xD;
             is being implemented for the Down syndrome group for several reasons. First, much of&#xD;
             the research using magnetic resonance imaging with this population is focused on&#xD;
             (older) adult populations and in particular the transition to early onset Alzheimer s&#xD;
             disease. Because most (if not all) individuals with Down syndrome demonstrate some&#xD;
             brain pathology consistent with Alzheimer s disease by age 30 (e.g., plaques and&#xD;
             tangles; Mann &amp; Esiri, 1989), we would like to enroll participants who are 30 years of&#xD;
             age and under. Second, studying children and young adults with Down syndrome fills a&#xD;
             significant gap in the literature, as there are very few structural magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging studies of children and young adults with Down syndrome reported in the&#xD;
             literature to date, and the majority of these studies are characterized by small&#xD;
             samples of convenience (i.e., clinic populations). Thus, there is still a need to&#xD;
             describe the developmental course of this disorder from early childhood to young&#xD;
             adulthood. Such developmental research may help shed light on the causes of&#xD;
             intellectual disability in Down syndrome and also identify individuals with the&#xD;
             syndrome who are most at risk for experiencing the cognitive decline that is reported&#xD;
             in the literature for some individuals after the age of 30 (Oliver et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meeting DSM-IV criteria for one of the pervasive developmental disorders (i.e.,&#xD;
             autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder-not&#xD;
             otherwise specified).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having a minimum IQ of 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIMH staff and their immediate family are excluded from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of severe psychiatric disorder (as diagnosed prior to subject study&#xD;
             enrollment) in the subject, sibling, or other first-degree relative. For these&#xD;
             purposes, exclusionary severe psychiatric disorder include schizophrenia and bipolar&#xD;
             affective disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of medical conditions known to affect cerebral anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dental braces.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications for MRI scanning according to the NMR Center MRI Safety Screening&#xD;
