      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a multifactorial disorder most commonly&#xD;
      occurring secondary to sepsis syndrome. Sepsis syndrome occurs in 250,000 to 500,000 patients&#xD;
      per year with approximately one-third of these developing ARDS and other organ failures.&#xD;
      Extensive studies utilizing the sheep endotoxin model of ARDS as well as data from human&#xD;
      pilot studies suggest that cyclooxygenase inhibitors (in particular, ibuprofen) would be&#xD;
      useful in the prevention and reversal of many of the pathophysiological abnormalities related&#xD;
      to sepsis. Animal studies where ibuprofen treatment was given prior to endotoxin have shown&#xD;
      that ibuprofen can improve oxygenation, pulmonary and systematic hemodynamics, airway&#xD;
      mechanics, and lung lymph flow. Importantly, animal studies have also shown that established&#xD;
      airways mechanics abnormalities and pulmonary hypertension can be reversed by ibuprofen even&#xD;
      when given 2.5 hours post endotoxin. Pilot studies of ibuprofen in patients with sepsis&#xD;
      syndrome showed that temperature and heart rate were significantly reduced and suggested that&#xD;
      airway mechanics and oxygenation were improved, shock was reversed and that these changes&#xD;
      were temporally related to prostaglandin levels in urine and plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of a multicenter study of ibuprofen intervention in patients with sepsis&#xD;
      performed at two medical centers between 1985 and 1987 demonstrated the antipyretic effect of&#xD;
      ibuprofen with accompanying decrease in heart rate, reduction in peak airway pressure during&#xD;
      the time of intervention, and evidence from urine assays of reduced in vivo production of&#xD;
      PGI2 and TxA2. Results suggested that PGI2 production correlated inversely with systemic&#xD;
      vascular resistance and the TxA2 production correlated directly with pPA and airway&#xD;
      resistance. Several parameters indicating beneficial effects tended toward improvement during&#xD;
      ibuprofen intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted at seven North American clinical centers and included a coordinating&#xD;
      center and a prostaglandin laboratory. Planning and completion of the protocol and manual of&#xD;
      operation took place for the first six months of the study. Patient accession extended for&#xD;
      three and a half years. Data analysis was conducted in the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter. Recruitment at the seven clinical&#xD;
      sites began in October 1989 and ended in March 1995. A total of 224 patients were randomized&#xD;
      in a double-blind fashion to ibuprofen given intravenously every six hours for a total of&#xD;
      eight doses and 231 patients were randomized to placebo. The major endpoint was mortality&#xD;
      rate at 30 days after randomization. Before the first dose of the study drug, a baseline&#xD;
      medical history was taken and a physical examination was performed to document the presumed&#xD;
      cause, site, and time of onset of the sepsis syndrome. Blood was obtained for culture from at&#xD;
      least two sites. Infection was classified as occurring in the lungs, peritoneum, or urinary&#xD;
      tract or at another site or an unknown site. Chest radiographs were obtained at entry and&#xD;
      scored by the chest radiologist to indicate the presence and severity of pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of the ibuprofen and placebo groups were balanced with respect to a&#xD;
      variety of measures that correlate with mortality and morbidity. The mean interval that&#xD;
      elapsed from the time the patient met the entry criteria to the administration of the study&#xD;
      drug was 10.7 +/- 0.6 hours in the ibuprofen group and 11.3 +/- 0.6 hours in the placebo&#xD;
      group. The predominant site of infection was the lung. In each group, infections associated&#xD;
      with positive blood cultures were considered to have been treated with appropriate&#xD;
      antibiotics in 96 percent of cases. Rates of organ dysfunction (organ failure) were similar&#xD;
      in the two groups at the time of randomization, except that renal dysfunction was&#xD;
      significantly more common in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of calculating the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II)&#xD;
      score was modified so that the score represented a point in time -- that is, it was&#xD;
      calculated from the baseline data rather than from the worst values obtained during the first&#xD;
      24 hours of care in the intensive care unit. Data obtained at entry and every four hours&#xD;
      thereafter for the first 44 hours and then at 72, 96, and 120 hours included the patient's&#xD;
      temperature, mean systemic blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, urinary output (as&#xD;
      an hourly average), arterial-blood gas measurements and requirements for antipyretic agents.&#xD;
      Values for mean blood pressure were calculated with the following formula: (0.33 x systolic&#xD;
      pressure) + (0.67 x diastolic pressure. When a pulmonary artery catheter was present, the&#xD;
      cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, and central venous&#xD;
      pressure were measured at baseline and 20 hours later. Blood lactate was measured, and the&#xD;
      delivery and consumption of oxygen calculated, at baseline and 20 hours. Blood samples were&#xD;
      obtained at baseline and 20, 44, 72, and 120 hours after study entry for the measurement of&#xD;
      hemoglobin, the total leukocyte count, the platelet count, bilirubin, serum aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and electrolytes.&#xD;
      Data were recorded on the patient's requirements for blood transfusion, intensive care, and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
