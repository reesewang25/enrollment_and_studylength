  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers plan to perform a diagnostic test called transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography in order to see and record the movement and function of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transesophageal echocardiography is similar to an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Different&#xD;
      views of the heart are taken by a small, flexible instrument positioned in the esophagus (the&#xD;
      tube that connects the mouth to the stomach). This allows doctors to create a clear picture&#xD;
      of the heart through the wall of the esophagus rather than from outside the body through the&#xD;
      muscles, fat, and bones of the chest wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During transesophageal echocardiography pictures of the heart will be taken while patients&#xD;
      rest and as patients receive a medication called dobutamine. Dobutamine is a medication that&#xD;
      makes the heart beat stronger and faster, similar to what exercise does to the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are particularly interested in studying patients with defects in the valves of&#xD;
      the heart, especially aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. Patients with these&#xD;
      defects in the heart valves tend to develop abnormalities in the size and function of the&#xD;
      left ventricle. The left ventricle is one of the four chambers of the heart responsible for&#xD;
      ejecting blood out of the heart into the circulation. Researchers believe that by identifying&#xD;
      changes in the function of heart muscle, they may be able to predict the occurrence of muscle&#xD;
      damage due to the diseased valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the function of heart muscle measured&#xD;
      during dobutamine stress transesophageal echocardiography can predict the later development&#xD;
      of problems in the function and size of the left ventricle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this investigation, we propose to perform dobutamine stress transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography in patients with aortic regurgitation and in patients with mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation in order to assess myocardial contractile reserve. The purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to determine whether the contractile reserve of the myocardium measured during dobutamine&#xD;
      stress echocardiography is a predictor of the development of subsequent left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction and left ventricular dilatation, as well as recovery of left ventricular function&#xD;
      after surgery, in these patients.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        18 - 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with severe aortic regurgitation and patients with severe mitral regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will discontinue medications 48 hours prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women must not be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have an associated valvular heart disease (i.e., patients with aortic&#xD;
        regurgitation will be excluded if there is coexistent mitral valve disease; patients with&#xD;
        mitral regurgitation will be excluded if there is coexistent aortic valve disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have any form of cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have ventricular ectopy during baseline conditions (i.e., couplets,&#xD;
        frequent PVc's [greater than 6/min], early coupling [&quot;R-on-T&quot; phenomenon], ventricular&#xD;
        bigeminy) that might potentially predispose the patient for the development of dangerous&#xD;
        dysrhythmia during dobutamine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have a history of cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have a history of congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have hypotension (i.e., systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have a systolic blood pressure greater than 200 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have a left atrial size of greater than 100 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have sinus tachycardia greater than or equal to 100 beats/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have esophageal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have any other medical condition that , at the discretion of the&#xD;
        physician in charge, may increase the risk of the procedure.&#xD;
