  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of letrozole in treating precocious (early)&#xD;
      puberty in girls with McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). The physical changes of puberty, such&#xD;
      as breast enlargement, menstruation and growth spurt, as well as the emotional changes of&#xD;
      this developmental stage, usually begin in girls between the ages of 8 and 14. Girls with&#xD;
      MAS, however, often begin puberty before age 7. In MAS, large ovarian cysts produce high&#xD;
      levels of estrogens (female hormones) that cause the changes of puberty. Children with MAS&#xD;
      also have polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD), a disease of bones that, depending on what&#xD;
      parts of the skeleton are affected, can lead to broken bones or disfigurement of the head,&#xD;
      face, arms and legs, or can cause pressure on nerves and blood vessels. Many children with&#xD;
      MAS have cafe-au-lait spots (increased pigmentation) on areas of their skin as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole is an estrogen-lowering drug that has been approved for treating women with breast&#xD;
      and other cancers. Although the drug has not been tested or approved for use in children,&#xD;
      some pediatric specialists have given it to girls with precocious puberty and MAS and found&#xD;
      that it improves their condition without harmful side effects. This study will examine&#xD;
      whether letrozole can lower estrogen in girls with MAS and arrest puberty. It will also study&#xD;
      the drug's effects on substances involved in bone growth, including calcium, phosphate and&#xD;
      amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls 1 to 8 years old with MAS may be eligible for this study. Patients who were enrolled in&#xD;
      NIH protocol 98-D-0145 (Screening and Natural History of Patients with Polyostotic Fibrous&#xD;
      Dysplasia and the McCune-Albright syndrome) are also eligible. Participants will be admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital for 2 to 3 days every 3 months for 15 months, for a total of 6 visits. They&#xD;
      will undergo a complete history and physical examination and routine blood and urine tests&#xD;
      every visit, as well as evaluations of their general health, growth and bone development,&#xD;
      endocrine system (hormone-secreting glands) status and PFD status. A hand X-ray will be taken&#xD;
      at the first visit and every 6 months to measure bone age advance. The children will begin&#xD;
      taking letrozole at the second visit and continue the drug for 6 months. They will be&#xD;
      evaluated after 3 months and 6 months on the drug (visits 3 and 4), and again after 3 months&#xD;
      and 6 months after stopping treatment (visits 5 and 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of children who weigh more than 18 kilograms (about 40 pounds) may be asked if extra&#xD;
      blood may be drawn after 3 months (visit 3) and 6 months (visit 4) of treatment to measure&#xD;
      letrozole levels. The blood will be drawn before the morning dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the dose through an indwelling needle placed in the vein for 8 to&#xD;
      24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will keep a record of all episodes of menstrual bleeding and any other symptoms or&#xD;
      complaints. Children who respond well to therapy (decreased menses, slowed breast&#xD;
      development, slowed growth and bone age advance) will be offered another 12 months of&#xD;
      letrozole treatment.&#xD;

      Girls ages 1 - 8 years with the McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) and girls with other&#xD;
      conditions characterized by precocious puberty due to estrogen hypersecretion from ovarian&#xD;
      cysts will be eligible for this pilot study. Patients who have previously enrolled in&#xD;
      Protocol 98-D-0145 (Screening and natural history of patients with polyostotic fibrous&#xD;
      dysplasia and the McCune-Albright Syndrome) will also be eligible. Patients will be treated&#xD;
      with letrozole, a potent, nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, to suppress their elevated serum&#xD;
      estrogen levels. We will confirm the safety and efficacy of letrozole, and study its&#xD;
      effectiveness in controlling the elevated sex steroid levels, and the advanced rates of&#xD;
      linear growth, bone maturation, and pubertal progression in these patients. We will also&#xD;
      study the effect of decreased estrogen levels on the status of their polyostotic fibrous&#xD;
      dysplasia by measuring serum and urine values for bone biomarkers, including calcium,&#xD;
      phosphate, organic amino acids, and vitamin D metabolites, which are known to be abnormal in&#xD;
      many patients with MAS. Patients will act as their own controls. We will compare serum and&#xD;
      urine parameters of pubertal progression and bone biomarkers before, during, and after&#xD;
      discontinuation of letrozole. This trial will be carried out in parallel with in-vitro and&#xD;
      in-vivo laboratory studies using an animal model of fibrous dysplasia. In this model,&#xD;
      osteogenic precursor cells from patient bone biopsies will be cultured in a&#xD;
      hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate matrix and transplanted into immunocompromised mice. We&#xD;
      anticipate that our laboratory findings will complement the care of our patients, resulting&#xD;
      in more effective treatment for the precocious puberty and the bone disease in children with&#xD;
      MAS. Because our initial studies have indicated that letrozole is effective in treating&#xD;
      precocious puberty in MAS patients, this protocol also enrolls girls who have a related&#xD;
      condition, gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty without the bone disease polyostotic&#xD;
      fibrous dysplasia. We also believe that this study complements the recent FDA and NIH&#xD;
      mandates that children be included in the evaluation of pharmaceutical products and in&#xD;
      federally funded clinical research studies.&#xD;
