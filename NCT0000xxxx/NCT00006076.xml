    <textblock>
      This study will examine the hereditary basis of tone deafness by identifying regions of the&#xD;
      human genome linked to this condition. Both exceptionally good pitch recognition (perfect&#xD;
      pitch) and exceptionally poor pitch recognition (tone deafness) run in families. A better&#xD;
      understanding of what causes tone deafness may provide new insights into auditory (hearing)&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with two or more family members 15 years of age or older who are tone deaf or&#xD;
      have trouble recognizing different melodies may be eligible for this study. Candidates will&#xD;
      be screened with a short listening test for pitch and a short written test. Those identified&#xD;
      with poor pitch recognition will fill out a brief questionnaire about their family tree and&#xD;
      family members (without identifying names) who have trouble recognizing melodies or tones.&#xD;
      Individuals with poor pitch recognition will be asked to help contact family members who may&#xD;
      be interested in participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of families with two or more first-degree relatives (parents, grandparents, siblings)&#xD;
      who are tone deaf may enroll in the study. They will provide a blood sample (about 2&#xD;
      tablespoons) for genetic studies and may take a 20-minute hearing test using headphones.&#xD;

      The primary goal of this study is to identify regions of the genome which show genetic&#xD;
      linkage to deficits in pitch recognition. Pitch recognition in subjects will be tested to&#xD;
      identify individuals and families with poor pitch recognition, known as tune deafness,&#xD;
      defined as the inability to recognize wrong notes in a popular melody. We will undertake a&#xD;
      2-stage process, first a screening to identify probands, and secondly a full family&#xD;
      ascertainment and enrollment. Probands and family members will be given an auditory and&#xD;
      verbal attention test, and additions listening tests to measure aspects of center auditory&#xD;
      processing and attention. Family phenotypic data will be used for additional epidemiological&#xD;
      studies of tune deafness. Affected and unaffected members of families containing multiple&#xD;
      tune deaf individuals will have 20 cc of blood drawn to obtain DNA. These DNA samples will&#xD;
      then be genotyped using markers distributed across the human genome, and the genotypic&#xD;
      information analyzed to determine which markers show linkage to tune deafness. Genetic&#xD;
      linkage is the initial step in the process of positional cloning, and cloning the defective&#xD;
      genes which underlie tune deafness is a long term goal of this research.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals over the age of 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study includes both males and females, and includes members of all racial and ethnic&#xD;
        groups. This study includes both normal and tune deaf individuals, as well as individuals&#xD;
        that may have intermediate scores on the Distorted Tunes Test, indicating a status between&#xD;
        completely tune deaf and normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hearing impaired individuals, as first estimated by a score of 25 or greater on the&#xD;
        American Academy of Otolaryngology's 5 Minute Hearing Test, or subsequently by audiological&#xD;
        exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cognitively impaired individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family members in families where only one person exhibits tune deafness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals currently using psychoactive medication.&#xD;
