    <textblock>
      The objective of this open-label study regimen is to make didanosine (ddI) available to&#xD;
      patients with AIDS who are clinically deteriorating on zidovudine (AZT) and cannot enter the&#xD;
      Phase II ddI programs due to protocol exclusion or geographic location.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent medications for treatment of complications of AIDS are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aerosolized pentamidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phenytoin, but with caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extreme caution should be exercised in the use of didanosine (ddI) in any patient&#xD;
             receiving concurrent therapies, particularly those receiving other nucleosides (e.g.,&#xD;
             ganciclovir), drugs with toxicities similar to those observed with ddI (list included&#xD;
             under concomitant medications section of protocol), and other drugs with significant&#xD;
             toxicities, including many drugs used for treatment of major opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Not suitable for entry into ddI phase II studies by reason of inclusion or exclusion&#xD;
        criteria or by reason of geographic location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able to provide signed informed consent (parent/guardian as appropriate). Available for&#xD;
        monthly follow-up while taking ddI. Meet required baseline laboratory values within 14 days&#xD;
        prior to initial drug dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extreme caution should be exercised in the use of ddI in any patient receiving&#xD;
             concomitant therapies, particularly those receiving other nucleosides (e.g.,&#xD;
             ganciclovir), drugs with toxicities similar to those observed with ddI (list included&#xD;
             under concomitant medications section of protocol), and other drugs with significant&#xD;
             toxicities, including many drugs used for treatment of major opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caution should also be exercised in a patient having intractable diarrhea or patients&#xD;
        following a low-sodium diet. Physicians caring for these patients must perform clinical and&#xD;
        laboratory evaluations every 7-10 days for the first 2 months of ddI therapy. Should any&#xD;
        adverse effect of any severity be detected during this period of intensive clinical and&#xD;
        laboratory monitoring, the physician must call Bristol-Myers Squibb (1-800-662-7999). If&#xD;
        the patient continues ddI therapy, Bristol-Myers Squibb will require submission of&#xD;
        follow-up and adverse experience report forms every 10 days. Although data are not&#xD;
        available to fully assess the risks associated with the use of ddI in high-risk patients&#xD;
        (for example, patients with preexisting disorders of body systems known to be adversely&#xD;
        affected by ddI, particularly those with history of peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis,&#xD;
        seizure disorder, cardiac abnormalities, gout, and significant elevations of liver function&#xD;
        test results), all such patients must have clinical and laboratory evaluations performed&#xD;
        every 10 days and results submitted to Bristol-Myers Squibb on the case report forms&#xD;
        provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any one of the following criteria are excluded:&#xD;
