    <textblock>
      This study will investigate in patients with Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis how the&#xD;
      body s immune system controls inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and&#xD;
      intestines)-specifically, how lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) function in&#xD;
      inflammatory responses. This protocol does not involve any experimental treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between the ages of 0 and 75 years of age with Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      or symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease may be eligible for this study. Screening tests may&#xD;
      include the following: medical history and physical examination, routine blood tests,&#xD;
      examination of stool specimens, X-rays such as barium enema or upper GI series,&#xD;
      proctosigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, gastroduodenoscopy, and small bowel biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive medical treatment according to the best generally accepted measures&#xD;
      for treating Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis. This may include anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs, and antibiotics to treat infections. A surgical consultation may be&#xD;
      recommended for patients whose disease does not respond to medical treatment. If surgery to&#xD;
      remove intestinal tissue is recommended, a qualified gastrointestinal surgeon will perform&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants may undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood drawing - No more than 450 milliliters (30 tablespoons, or 15 ounces) of blood&#xD;
           will be taken from adults over a 6-week period. A maximum of 7 ml (1/2 tablespoon) of&#xD;
           blood per kilogram (2.2. pounds) of body weight will be obtained from children within&#xD;
           the same time period, with no more than 3 ml/kg taken at any one time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis - This procedure is done to collect large quantities of white blood cells.&#xD;
           Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The&#xD;
           blood is circulated through a machine that separates it into its components, and the&#xD;
           white cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through&#xD;
           the same needle or through another needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intestinal biopsies - Intestinal tissue will be obtained during colonoscopy with&#xD;
           intestinal biopsy in patients who require this procedure as part of their standard&#xD;
           medical care. Patients are given a sedative to reduce anxiety, but are conscious during&#xD;
           the procedure. A flexible tube is inserted into the rectum and large intestine, allowing&#xD;
           the physician to see the intestinal mucosa. At various places, small pieces of tissue&#xD;
           are plucked out.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This natural history protocol provides for the evaluation of patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, IBD associated with&#xD;
      immunodeficiency and genetic diseases such as chronic granulomatous disease and&#xD;
      Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and additional undefined inflammatory conditions of the gut)&#xD;
      either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. The purpose of this protocol is to assess the&#xD;
      extent and activity of the disease in such patients, conduct immunologic studies of&#xD;
      lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cells derived from peripheral blood and tissues, administer&#xD;
      and monitor treatments, and study the genetic risk factors for these diseases. This study&#xD;
      will also be used to provide a mechanism for procurement of intestinal samples obtained at&#xD;
      sites outside the NIH at the time of medically indicated surgical or endoscopic procedures&#xD;
      from patients with IBD. In addition, it will allow for the procurement (send-in) of blood for&#xD;
      both immunological studies as well as DNA preparation as more IBD susceptibility genes are&#xD;
      discovered and we further our work on association of genetic polymorphisms/mutations with the&#xD;
      phenotype and immune abnormalities observed in our IBD patients. This protocol will also&#xD;
      allow for the procurement of blood and tissue samples from healthy volunteers (without IBD)&#xD;
      here at the NIH to use as a control group in comparison to the immunologic and genetic data&#xD;
      we obtain from the IBD patients that are enrolled. The immediate aims of these studies are to&#xD;
      define the immunologic abnormalities present and to identify genetic susceptibility factors&#xD;
      in patients with these diseases. The long-term goal of this protocol is to identify specific&#xD;
      targets for development of novel therapeutics for inflammatory bowel diseases.&#xD;

        give each employee a copy of the NIH information sheet on Employee Research Participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For NIH employees:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either&#xD;
             beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or work situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The NIH information sheet regarding NIH employee research participation will be&#xD;
             distributed to all potential subjects who are NIH employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The employee subject s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved in accordance&#xD;
             with NIH Clinical Center and NIAID policies, which define the scope and limitations of&#xD;
             the protections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For NIH employee subjects, consent will be obtained by an individual independent of&#xD;
             the employee s team. Those in a supervisory position to any employee and co-workers of&#xD;
             the employee will not obtain consent. The protocol study staff will be trained&#xD;
             annually on obtaining potentially sensitive and private information from co-workers or&#xD;
             subordinates. This training will be reinforced as needed, at weekly team meetings.&#xD;

             the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
