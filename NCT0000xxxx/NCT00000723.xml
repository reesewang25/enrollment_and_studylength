      To determine the safety and toxicity of high-dose systemic methotrexate (MTX) and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (DEX) combined with zidovudine (AZT) and brain irradiation in patients with&#xD;
      AIDS-related primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and to determine response rates&#xD;
      and survival of treated patients. Also to determine if the treatment inhibits HIV replication&#xD;
      in patients who are HIV culture and/or antigen positive and to assess the incidence of&#xD;
      opportunistic infection in these patients Results of radiation given to patients with&#xD;
      AIDS-related high-grade CNS lymphoma have been disappointing, with short survival times due&#xD;
      to infection complications. However, complete response has been documented after radiation in&#xD;
      some patients. High-dose MTX will be used to improve the possibility of a greater&#xD;
      antineoplastic response than that obtained by radiation alone. Since the underlying&#xD;
      immunodeficiency state is not affected by therapy directed against the lymphoma, patients are&#xD;
      still prone to life-threatening opportunistic infections or relapse of lymphomatous disease&#xD;
      within the CNS. Accordingly, AZT will also be used in an attempt to alter the overall natural&#xD;
      history of the disease.&#xD;

      Results of radiation given to patients with AIDS-related high-grade CNS lymphoma have been&#xD;
      disappointing, with short survival times due to infection complications. However, complete&#xD;
      response has been documented after radiation in some patients. High-dose MTX will be used to&#xD;
      improve the possibility of a greater antineoplastic response than that obtained by radiation&#xD;
      alone. Since the underlying immunodeficiency state is not affected by therapy directed&#xD;
      against the lymphoma, patients are still prone to life-threatening opportunistic infections&#xD;
      or relapse of lymphomatous disease within the CNS. Accordingly, AZT will also be used in an&#xD;
      attempt to alter the overall natural history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation begins on day 1 of therapy. Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or by&#xD;
      intravenous injection (IV) on days 1-10. MTX IV over 6 hours weekly for a total of 4 doses&#xD;
      starts 1 week after completion of the cranial radiation. Leucovorin (LCV) IV or PO begins 6&#xD;
      hours after MTX has been completed over 6 hours for 8 doses. AZT while awake starts on day 1&#xD;
      of therapy and continues for 52 weeks. Patients are reevaluated with computerized tomography&#xD;
      (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain at conclusion of radiation therapy&#xD;
      and systemic treatment, 6 and 10 weeks respectively. If there is a complete or partial&#xD;
      response (CR or PR), patient will remain on study and continue to receive AZT; if stable&#xD;
      disease or no response, patient will be taken off study. Reevaluation at 16 weeks from start&#xD;
      of study will be done. If CR or PR, the patient will continue AZT for 1 year. If there is no&#xD;
      change or progression of disease, or if the patient develops evidence of systemic&#xD;
      lymphomatous disease, patient will be taken off study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have negative titers for toxoplasmosis or other infectious etiology for&#xD;
             CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zidovudine may be continued per protocol specifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologic diagnosis of lymphoma in central nervous system (CNS) must be confirmed but&#xD;
             no previous treatment is allowed. In participating institutions where CNS biopsies&#xD;
             cannot be obtained, the patient may be considered eligible if space-occupying lesions&#xD;
             have been demonstrated on computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with&#xD;
             negative titers for toxoplasmosis or negative response to empiric therapy for&#xD;
             intracerebral toxoplasmosis and negative workup for other infectious etiology of CNS&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
