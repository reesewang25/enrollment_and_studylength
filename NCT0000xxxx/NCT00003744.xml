    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how patients with incurable salivary gland cancer, who&#xD;
      have not had chemotherapy before, respond to Gemcitabine. The investigators are trying to&#xD;
      find out what effects (good and bad) Gemcitabine has on participants and salivary gland&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine has been shown to be an effective chemotherapy agent in other types of cancer,&#xD;
      including; bladder cancer, breast cancer, certain types of lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and&#xD;
      pancreas cancer. Gemcitabine has yet to be studied for efficacy in subjects with salivary&#xD;
      gland cancer and in general other chemotherapy drugs have shown to be ineffective so far in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the response rate of patients with incurable salivary gland cancer treated with&#xD;
           gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the time to progression and toxicity of this therapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine IV for 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 day course.&#xD;
      Patients receive a minimum of 2 courses of treatment. Patients may continue treatment in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 2 months.&#xD;

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic diagnosis of any of the following malignancies originating from salivary&#xD;
             tissue: adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma,&#xD;
             malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated&#xD;
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be incurable on the basis of unresectable local or distant disease as&#xD;
             determined by the patient's surgeon and not be potentially curable by radiation&#xD;
             therapy as determined by a radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received radiation to any site with the following caveat: the sites&#xD;
             used for evaluation for response are either not previously irradiated or they have&#xD;
             shown progression of disease post radiation and there has been a time interval of one&#xD;
             month since these sites were radiated.&#xD;
