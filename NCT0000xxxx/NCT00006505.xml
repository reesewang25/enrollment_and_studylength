      This study will test whether a new islet transplant procedure will enable patients with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes mellitus to stop insulin therapy. Islets are cell clusters in the pancreas that&#xD;
      contain insulin-producing cells. The new procedure features three important advances, first&#xD;
      developed by a group in Edmonton, Canada, over the way islet transplants have traditionally&#xD;
      been performed: 1) the islets are transplanted immediately after they are removed from the&#xD;
      donor; 2) islets are transplanted from two different donors in order to obtain the number of&#xD;
      islets in a normal pancreas; and 3) the anti-rejection drug regimen is designed to reduce the&#xD;
      harmful side effects of &quot;conditioning&quot; chemotherapy. (In the standard transplant procedure,&#xD;
      patients receive intensive chemotherapy following the transplant. This study will use no&#xD;
      radiation and lower-dose chemotherapy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between the ages of 18 and 65 with the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus for at&#xD;
      least 5 years may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination, blood tests, chest X-ray and tuberculin skin test,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and exercise test for heart function, abdominal ultrasound, psychological&#xD;
      evaluation, and an arginine stimulated c-peptide test. The latter test determines if the&#xD;
      patient is producing any insulin. Eligibility is restricted to patients who make no insulin&#xD;
      at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has an active phase lasting 15 months and follow-up that continues indefinitely.&#xD;
      Patients will receive 10,000 &quot;islet equivalents&quot; per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight.&#xD;
      This will likely require two separate transplant procedures from two donors. Before the first&#xD;
      surgery, patients will be given anti-rejection (immune suppressing) drugs, including FK506&#xD;
      and rapamycin (orally) and daclizumab (intravenously). The islets will be infused through a&#xD;
      tube placed in the portal vein (the large vein that feeds the liver). After surgery, patients&#xD;
      will receive insulin intravenously for 24 hours. They will then have an abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
      and blood tests to determine liver function. If fewer than 10,000 islets were transplanted,&#xD;
      patients will continue insulin treatment, with the dosages adjusted to account for the&#xD;
      transplanted islets. They will take Daclizumab every 2 weeks, and FK506 and rapamycin daily.&#xD;
      Blood tests to follow how much of these drugs are in the blood stream will be performed daily&#xD;
      at first and then weekly after blood levels of these drugs stabilize. They will be given&#xD;
      antibiotics to prevent infections. The arginine test will be repeated 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      transplant and periodically thereafter. Blood will be drawn weekly to check drug levels, and&#xD;
      monthly for other tests. The investigators will track daily insulin requirements, and these&#xD;
      will be recorded monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who require a second transplant to achieve the required amount of islets will return&#xD;
      for the procedure when a compatible organ is donated. The second procedure will be done as&#xD;
      described above. As before, insulin will be infused for 24 hours following surgery. It will&#xD;
      then be stopped, however, and will not be resumed unless blood glucose levels reach above 180&#xD;
      milligrams/deciliter. Patients will continue taking FK506 and rapamycin indefinitely.&#xD;
      Daclizumab will be given every 2 weeks for 4 doses following the second transplant, and then&#xD;
      stopped. Patients will take an antiviral called ganciclovir for 14 weeks and another&#xD;
      antibiotic for 1 year following surgery. For the first year after surgery, patients will have&#xD;
      frequent blood tests to monitor drug levels and immune function. They will return to NIH for&#xD;
      a complete history and physical examination 2 and 3 years after the final islet transplant&#xD;
      and will be contacted yearly by phone to ascertain their general health status and whether&#xD;
      they remain insulin independent.&#xD;

      We will test whether pancreatic islets isolated from cadaveric human donor pancreata can be&#xD;
&#xD;
      transplanted into the portal vein of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in such a&#xD;
      way so as to achieve insulin independence for the recipient. The protocol will employ a&#xD;
      defined islet isolation procedure, percutaneous islet infusion into the recipient s portal&#xD;
      vein via an intra-portal catheter, tight glycemic control during the peri-transplant period,&#xD;
      and a novel immunosuppressive protocol that avoids glucocorticoids. Up to 20 patients between&#xD;
      the ages of 18 and 65 who have been diagnosed with T1DM for at least five years and who have&#xD;
      no detectable endogenous insulin producing capacity will be enrolled. Since the study calls&#xD;
      for at least 10,000 islet equivalents (IEQs) per kilogram recipient body weight to be&#xD;
      transplanted, and since a typical human pancreas yields approximately 2.0 to 4.0 times 105&#xD;
      IEQs, most protocol enrollees will require islets isolated from two different donors. Islets&#xD;
      will be transplanted shortly after isolation, and since human donor pancreata are available&#xD;
      at unpredictable times, the timing of the islet transplant procedure will also be&#xD;
      unpredictable. The study s primary end-point will be insulin independence at one year&#xD;
      following the transplantation of at least 10,000 IEQs per kilogram recipient body weight.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be evidence of partial islet function as reflected by stimulated&#xD;
      c-peptide secretion, a Hgb A1c of 7.0% or less, and the absence of severe hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Additional secondary endpoints will be to determine: 1) if any immune parameters are&#xD;
      predictive of islet loss, 2) if islet transplantation has any effect on renal function and 3)&#xD;
      if the protocol influences fasting lipid profiles.&#xD;
