  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gyrate atrophy is a rare hereditary disease of the eye's retina (the layer of light-sensitive&#xD;
      tissue that lines the inside of the eyeball) and choroid (a vascular layer of tissue behind&#xD;
      the retina). Degeneration of these structures causes near-sightedness, cataracts and&#xD;
      progressive loss of vision. This study will examine eye function and chemical and molecular&#xD;
      abnormalities in patients with gyrate atrophy to try to better understand, diagnose, and&#xD;
      treat the condition. Patients with other degenerative diseases of the choroid and retina,&#xD;
      such as retinitis pigmentosa, choroideremia, and others, will also be studied for comparison.&#xD;
      Family members of patients will be studied, when possible, to try to identify the genetic&#xD;
      basis of the disease and gain information that will aid in genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will undergo a physical examination and eye examination, including tests&#xD;
      of color vision, field of vision, and ability to see in the dark. An electroretinogram and&#xD;
      electrooculogram will measure visual cell function. Photographs of the retina will be taken.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for biochemical study and gene research. Family members who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will undergo the same eye tests and will also have blood drawn for&#xD;
      genetic studies. Patients with gyrate atrophy will also be asked to undergo a small skin&#xD;
      biopsy for biochemical and genetic study. They will provide a family history in order to draw&#xD;
      a family tree showing how the disease is distributed among family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with gyrate atrophy may also participate in studies of the effect of vitamin B6 and&#xD;
      diet on blood levels of the amino acid ornithine, which is elevated in patients with gyrate&#xD;
      atrophy. Participants will take 500 mg of vitamin B6 by mouth every day for 3 to 6 months. If&#xD;
      this study confirms a reduction of ornithine levels, then long-term studies of the vitamin as&#xD;
      a possible treatment for the disease may be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the vitamin B6 study, patients will start a nearly protein-free diet to lower ornithine&#xD;
      blood levels. More than 2,000 calories are carbohydrate and fat. Some special low-protein&#xD;
      foods and limited fruit is included, plus amino acid supplements. Patients who have carefully&#xD;
      adhered to this diet have lowered their ornithine levels and slowed disease progression.&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized for the first 1 to 3 weeks for close monitoring with frequent&#xD;
      urine and blood tests. When the blood ornithine level is normalized, a less restricted low&#xD;
      protein diet will be prescribed. Participants will have monthly blood tests and a complete&#xD;
      eye examination every 6 months to 1 year to evaluate disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GA) is a rare autosomal recessive chorioretinal&#xD;
      degeneration characterized by myopia, cataract, varying degrees of night blindness, and&#xD;
      progressive constriction of visual fields associated with chorioretinal atrophy resulting in&#xD;
      blindness. The objectives of this protocol are threefold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Document the natural history of gyrate atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Relate the clinical course to the gene defect to explore the genetic heterogeneity&#xD;
           inherent in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the clinical course and laboratory findings of the effects of an&#xD;
           arginine-deficient diet. The study population is patients with elevated plasma ornithine&#xD;
           and absence of ornithine-delta-aminotransferase activity. This is a natural history&#xD;
           study, with a nested intervention study, non-randomized, with the outcome parameters&#xD;
           being psychophysical, electrophysiological and ophthalmoscopic examination.&#xD;
