      To determine the safety and patient tolerance of UVAR Photopheresis System (extracorporeal&#xD;
      photopheresis) in the Treatment of AIDS-Related Complex (ARC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment involves the patient ingesting 8-methoxsalen (8-MOP) by mouth approximately two&#xD;
      hours prior to each photopheresis session. The photopheresis instrument will separate the&#xD;
      patient's white blood cells and some plasma from other blood components and return the&#xD;
      majority of blood components to the patient. The separated white blood cells and plasma will&#xD;
      be exposed to UVA (Ultraviolet A) light while outside the body. The UVA light photoactivates&#xD;
      the 8-MOP drug which is now located in the DNA of the collected cells. After this exposure,&#xD;
      the patients photoactivated white blood cells will be returned to the patient by venous&#xD;
      access.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of AIDS-related complex (ARC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Veins that can provide adequate access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative drug screen for drugs of abuse and zidovudine (AZT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing to adhere to the protocol and sign a patient informed consent prior to&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live within adequate commuting distance to the treatment center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not be on any other investigational drug/device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 18 - 80 years old but minimum age requirements may be affected by state regulations&#xD;
             or specific medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to tolerate extracorporeal volume loss during the leukocyte-enrichment&#xD;
             phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Photosensitive disease, such as porphyria or systemic lupus erythematosus. Care must&#xD;
             be taken in selecting patients who require drugs (either systemically or topically)&#xD;
             during the course of the study with photosensitizing potential such as phenothiazines,&#xD;
             tetracyclines, sulfonamides or chlorothiazide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal insufficiency with creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of toxic effects (World Health Organization Criteria) resulting from previous&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe emotional, behavioral or psychiatric problems that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would result in poor compliance with the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity reactions to 8-MOP compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or active Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, other opportunistic infection or&#xD;
             neoplasms (Kaposi's sarcoma), or wasting syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aphakia because of the significantly increased risk of retinal damage due to absence&#xD;
             of lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;

          -  Zidovudine (AZT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Photosensitizing drugs should not be administered prior to photopheresis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other investigational drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients with the following are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Actively involved in drug abuse.&#xD;
