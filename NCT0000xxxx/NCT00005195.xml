      To assess factors associated with safety and efficacy of catheter ablation using direct&#xD;
      current or radiofrequency energy for the management of patients with drug and/or pacemaker&#xD;
      resistant cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac tachyarrhythmias that are refractory to either conventional or experimental&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic therapy, antitachycardia pacemakers, or both, may result in serious symptoms&#xD;
      or death. Catheter ablation has been developed as a nonpharmacologic, closed-chest&#xD;
      alternative for the management of these patients. The technique was first applied to man in&#xD;
      1981 and reported by both Scheinman et al and Gallagher et al in 1982. Hartzler reported the&#xD;
      first catheter ablation procedure for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in 1983. In&#xD;
      that same year, Weber reported the first use of catheter ablation of an accessory&#xD;
      atrioventricular pathway. The standard method of energy delivery for closed-chest catheter&#xD;
      ablation attempts involved direct current delivered using a defibrillator, but beginning in&#xD;
      1985, radiofrequency energy was employed in man. This promised to revolutionize the field of&#xD;
      catheter ablation, because it offered the hope of more precise destruction of tissue, avoided&#xD;
      the need for general anesthesia and significantly lowered complication rates, since it did&#xD;
      not involve the levels of energy used in direct current attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Catheter Ablation Registry (CAR) evolved from a pilot study, the Percutaneous Cardiac&#xD;
      Mapping and Ablation Registry (PCMAR) formed in 1983. There were scientific limitations in&#xD;
      this voluntary registry. Further prospective studies were needed to better define this&#xD;
      procedure, and a multicenter international prospective cohort study was designed to allow a&#xD;
      rapid assessment of ablation's dangers and potential usefulness. Results from the study were&#xD;
      used to guide physicians as to which patients would and would not benefit from these new&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected prospectively from sixteen clinical centers in the United States and&#xD;
      Europe on attempted catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction, accessory&#xD;
      atrioventricular pathways and ventricular tachycardia. Each of the three ablation techniques&#xD;
      was studied as a separate subset and the two methods of energy delivery, direct current or&#xD;
      radiofrequency energy, were compared within each subset. A standardized protocol was used for&#xD;
      direct current ablation and the results of a variety of protocols for the other two&#xD;
      procedures and for radiofrequency energy were observed. Patients were evaluated quarterly in&#xD;
      the first post-procedure year, and biannually for the subsequent duration of the study.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed to determine the distribution of specific patient&#xD;
      characteristics such as age, sex, clinical status, underlying heart disease, and a variety of&#xD;
      procedural categories including energy level, mapping data, and catheter position. A&#xD;
      determination was made of the frequency of successful outcomes including cessation of&#xD;
      arrhythmias, production of third degree atrioventricular block, and disappearance of symptoms&#xD;
      and of adverse effects, including procedure-related complications and death.&#xD;
