      This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate, low-dose total-body irradiation, and&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant followed by donor lymphocyte infusion in treating older&#xD;
      patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before&#xD;
      a donor bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the&#xD;
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells&#xD;
      from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem&#xD;
      cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells&#xD;
      from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine&#xD;
      and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening. Once the donated&#xD;
      stem cells begin working, the patient's immune system may see the remaining cancer cells as&#xD;
      not belonging in the patient's body and destroy them (called graft-versus-tumor effect).&#xD;
      Giving an infusion of the donor's white blood cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) may boost&#xD;
      this effect.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if mixed hematopoietic chimerism can be safely established using a&#xD;
      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients &gt; 65 years of age with chronic myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (CML) in chronic or accelerated phase who have human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;
      identical related donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if mixed chimerism, established with non-myeloablative conditioning&#xD;
      regimens, can be converted to full donor hematopoietic chimerism by infusions of donor&#xD;
      lymphocytes (DLI), and thereby produce an immunologic cure of the malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to&#xD;
      -2 and undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (PBSCT) on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV BID or&#xD;
      thrice daily (TID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 77 or 180, and mycophenolate mofetil PO&#xD;
      or IV BID on days 0-27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLI: At least 2 weeks after completion of immunosuppression, patients with &gt; 5% donor cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation (CD)3+ T cells and no evidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) receive&#xD;
      donor lymphocytes IV over 30 minutes. Patients may receive up to 3 DLIs at increasing cell&#xD;
      doses in the absence of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.&#xD;

Mixed chimerism is detection of donor T cells (CD3+) and granulocytes (CD33+), as proportion of total T cell and granulocyte population of &gt; 5% and &lt; 95% in peripheral blood. Full donor chimerism is &gt; 95% donor CD3+ T cells. Increasing donor chimerism is absolute increase of 20% of CD3+ T cells over chimerism evaluation of previous month. Decreasing donor chimerism is absolute decrease of 20% of CD3+ T cell chimerism over previous month. Low donor chimerism is &lt; 40% CD3+ T cells after HSCT.</description>
