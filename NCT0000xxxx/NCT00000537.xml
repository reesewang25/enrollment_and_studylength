      To compare the effects of two stress reduction techniques, Transcendental Meditation (TM) and&#xD;
      Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR), on the control of mild hypertension in elderly Blacks&#xD;
      with hypertension.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life expectancy for Black Americans is about 10 percent less than for whites. The leading&#xD;
      cause of excessive mortality in older Blacks is cardiovascular disease which may be largely&#xD;
      due to disproportionately high rates of hypertension in older Blacks. Conventional&#xD;
      antihypertensive drug therapies are frequently associated with adverse effects on&#xD;
      quality-of-life (QL) and low compliance rates, especially in elderly minority populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is an extension of a pilot study on a comparable sample of 80 Black&#xD;
      elderly. The previous study, which was the first of its kind, yielded results which indicated&#xD;
      that both TM and PMR produced moderate reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      with TM producing the most significant improvements in blood pressure and in quality-of-life.&#xD;
      Dr. Schneider hypothesized from this and related evidence that TM should prove to be an&#xD;
      effective therapeutic adjunct to regular pharmacotherapy for mild hypertension in elderly&#xD;
      Blacks, and should prove even more effective in fostering compliance and in improving overall&#xD;
      quality-of-life without any of the unpleasant side effects of anti-hypertensive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized. Over an 18-month period, 213 people were screened for inclusion in the study. Of&#xD;
      these, 127 with initial diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 109 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      of 189 mm Hg or less, and final baseline blood pressure of 179/104 or less mm Hg were&#xD;
      randomized to treatment. Of the 127 participants, 16 did not complete follow-up blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements. Thus, 111 subjects completed the study. All subjects were pretested&#xD;
      over a four session baseline period on clinic blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure,&#xD;
      cardiovascular and emotional reactivity, and quality-of-life measures. Subjects were then&#xD;
      randomly assigned, 36 to TM, 37 to PMR, and 38 to lifestyle modification education control&#xD;
      and followed monthly with major post-tests at three months and eighteen months on these&#xD;
      variables. The primary outcome variables were changes in clinic systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure values measured blindly. The secondary outcomes were changes in self-monitored home&#xD;
      blood pressure and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was extended through July, 2007 for an additional 5 years of followup of the&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
