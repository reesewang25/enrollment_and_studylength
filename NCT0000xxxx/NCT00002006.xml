      To assess the safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered sargramostim (&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF ) in increasing and maintaining the&#xD;
      neutrophil count in HIV-infected adults who have developed neutropenia as a result of&#xD;
      receiving the antiretroviral agent, zidovudine ( AZT ). To assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      subcutaneously administered GM-CSF in increasing and maintaining the neutrophil count in&#xD;
      HIV-infected adults with pre-existing neutropenia who are at high risk of developing&#xD;
      hematologic intolerance while receiving the antiretroviral agent, AZT, for the first time. To&#xD;
      assess the potential therapeutic benefit of concomitant GM-CSF and AZT on the natural history&#xD;
      of HIV infection and associated infectious complications.&#xD;
