  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of F105 human monoclonal antibody both following&#xD;
      a single dose and during intermittent administration in HIV-infected patients. To determine&#xD;
      specific dose concentrations sufficient to achieve efficacy and avoid toxicity. To determine&#xD;
      the effect of F105 on virologic, immunologic, and serologic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early in the course of HIV infection, the primary humoral immune response appears to be&#xD;
      highly strain specific and to be directed at a hypervariable portion of the viral gp120. The&#xD;
      F105 human monoclonal antibody reacts with the CD4 binding region of gp120 and has been shown&#xD;
      to neutralize the IIIB, SF2, and MN strains of HIV at concentrations readily achievable in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;

      Early in the course of HIV infection, the primary humoral immune response appears to be&#xD;
      highly strain specific and to be directed at a hypervariable portion of the viral gp120. The&#xD;
      F105 human monoclonal antibody reacts with the CD4 binding region of gp120 and has been shown&#xD;
      to neutralize the IIIB, SF2, and MN strains of HIV at concentrations readily achievable in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, three cohorts of four patients each receive a single intravenous (IV) injection of&#xD;
      F105 human monoclonal antibody at 1 of 3 doses. The IV catheter will remain in the patient's&#xD;
      arm for 12 hours after injection for subsequent drawing of blood samples. The third group&#xD;
      (highest dose) will be studied only after the first two groups are analyzed for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics. No more than two patients are enrolled per week. Patients on Part A undergo&#xD;
      follow-up three to four times within the first week after injection and weekly thereafter for&#xD;
      7 weeks. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity data generated from Part A will be used to select two&#xD;
      dose levels for intermittent administration in Part B. In this part, cohorts of four to six&#xD;
      patients receive one of two doses of F105 for 8-12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per 9/30/94 amendment, eight patients receive one dose of F105 every 21 days for four doses&#xD;
      (dose determined from analysis of Part A data).&#xD;
