    <textblock>
      The objective of this treatment IND protocol is to make didanosine (ddI) available to&#xD;
      patients with HIV infection (suffering from AIDS related complex (ARC) or AIDS) who have&#xD;
      developed documented intolerance to zidovudine (AZT) and cannot enter a Phase II ddI program&#xD;
      due to protocol exclusion or geographic location.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications for the treatment of AIDS or ARC (including aerosolized&#xD;
             pentamidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phenytoin, but with caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extreme caution should be exercised in the use of ddI in any patient receiving&#xD;
             concomitant therapies, particularly those receiving other nucleosides (e.g.&#xD;
             ganciclovir), drugs with toxicities similar to those observed with ddI (list included&#xD;
             under concomitant medications section of protocol), and other drugs with significant&#xD;
             toxicities, including many drugs used for treatment of major opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Have a diagnosis of AIDS or be symptomatic, HIV positive, and have a CD4 cell count &lt; 200&#xD;
        cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be intolerant to zidovudine (AZT) therapy. Not be suitable for study entry into the phase&#xD;
        II didanosine (ddI) study by reason of inclusion or exclusion criteria or by reason of&#xD;
        geographic location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be able to provide signed informed consent (parent/guardian as appropriate). Be available&#xD;
        for monthly follow-up while taking ddI. Meet baseline lab criteria within 14 days prior to&#xD;
        initial drug dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extreme caution should be exercised in the use of ddI in any patient receiving&#xD;
             concomitant therapies, particularly those receiving other nucleosides (e.g.,&#xD;
             ganciclovir), drugs with toxicities similar to those observed with ddI (list included&#xD;
             under concomitant medications section of protocol), and other drugs with significant&#xD;
             toxicities, including many drugs used for treatment of major opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caution should also be exercised in a patient having intractable diarrhea or patients&#xD;
        following a low-sodium diet. Physicians caring for patients must perform clinical and&#xD;
        laboratory evaluations every 7 - 10 days for the first 2 months of ddI therapy. All&#xD;
        high-risk patients (for example, patients with preexisting disorders of body systems known&#xD;
        to be adversely affected by ddI, particularly those with a history of peripheral&#xD;
        neuropathy, pancreatitis, seizure disorder, cardiac abnormalities, gout, and significant&#xD;
        elevations of liver function test results), must have clinical and laboratory evaluations&#xD;
        performed every 10 days and results submitted to Bristol-Myers Squibb on the case report&#xD;
        forms provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-emetic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Required:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zidovudine (AZT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancy likely to require chemotherapy in the first 3 months of ddI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A poorly controlled seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade B or greater peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zidovudine (AZT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy in the first 3 months of ddI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancy likely to require systemic chemotherapy in the first 3 months of ddI&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A poorly controlled seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade B or greater peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded within 15 days of study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any antiretroviral drug except zidovudine (AZT).&#xD;
