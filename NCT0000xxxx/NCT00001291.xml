  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will examine blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue from patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory joint diseases to study genetic and&#xD;
      immunologic factors involved in the cause, development and progression of these conditions.&#xD;
      Synovial fluid is the lubricating fluid in joints. The synovial membrane is a delicate tissue&#xD;
      lining the inner surface of joints, which, in arthritic conditions, thickens and becomes&#xD;
      infiltrated with various types of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and certain patients with other forms of arthritis may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Those enrolled will be followed periodically for follow-up and&#xD;
      disease evaluation. They may undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Synovial fluid aspiration, when medically indicated (for example, for joint swelling and&#xD;
           inflammation). For this procedure, an area of skin around the joint is numbed with an&#xD;
           anesthetic, and a needle is inserted into the joint to withdraw a small fluid sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Periodic blood sampling, not to exceed 450 milliliters (15 ounces) during any 6-week&#xD;
           period, for genetic studies of rheumatoid arthritis. The samples are usually taken at&#xD;
           the same times that synovial fluid is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Synovial tissues, collected by needle biopsy or during surgical procedures for&#xD;
           arthroscopy (examination of the interior of the joint and repair of the joint) or total&#xD;
           joint replacement. For the needle biopsy, the skin over the biopsy site is washed and&#xD;
           anesthetized. A needle is inserted and fluid is aspirated. The biopsy needle is then&#xD;
           inserted through the outer needle and a tissue sample is suctioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who qualify for other research studies may be invited to participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood, synovial fluids and/or synovial tissues will be obtained from patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis and related chronic inflammatory arthritides. The synovial tissues will be obtained&#xD;
      by one of the following methods: a) needle biopsy, or b) at the time of a total joint&#xD;
      replacement or a therapeutic arthroscopic procedure. These materials will be utilized for&#xD;
      laboratory studies of etiopathogenetic mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis and related&#xD;
      autoimmune joint diseases.&#xD;

        Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly new onset disease, but certain patients&#xD;
        with other forms of arthritis will also be included.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Synovial tissue specimens will not be obtained from patients when any of the following&#xD;
        conditions are present: abnormal bleeding or clotting tests, platelet count less than&#xD;
