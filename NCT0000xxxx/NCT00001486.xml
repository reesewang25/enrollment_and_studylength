  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This large ongoing study at NIMH investigates the neurobiology of schizophrenia by&#xD;
      identifying susceptibility genes, evaluating their impact on brain function to better&#xD;
      understand how to treat and prevent this illness.&#xD;

      Objective: Schizophrenia is a complex genetic disorder which likely involves many genes each&#xD;
      producing a slight increase in risk. Finding weak-acting genes in complex genetic disorders&#xD;
      has been challenging and will likely require a number of approaches and large clinical&#xD;
      samples. Several strategies have emerged recently that appear to markedly improve the power&#xD;
      of genetic studies for detecting such genes. These include using association (rather than&#xD;
      linkage) and using intermediate phenotypes in addition to DMS-IV diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: We propose to take advantage of these techniques by studying quantitative&#xD;
      traits related to schizophrenia in patients, siblings, and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: We will employ an association design, rather than linkage. Traits will include&#xD;
      quantifiable neurobiological variables that have been implicated previously as possible&#xD;
      phenotypes related to schizophrenia. These include tests of attention and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure: We will use several statistical methods to show that specific genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms affect these phenotypes, including case control and family based association&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for Siblings (probands and unaffected siblings):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Probands must have a DSM IV-R diagnosis of schizophrenia,schizoaffective disorder,&#xD;
             psychosis N.O.S. or schizophreniform disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Probands and Siblings must be between the ages of 18 and 55&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Probands and Siblings must be free of major medical illnesses, but may have controlled&#xD;
             hypertension, thyroid disease, or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Probands and Siblings must have the cognitive ability to consent for themselves. Those&#xD;
             who are judged to have the cognitive ability to consent for themselves at the time of&#xD;
             participation, but do not have the legal capacity to consent for themselves may&#xD;
             participate if the legal guardian /Legal authorized representative (LAR) provides&#xD;
             consent by signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fluency in English is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Siblings (probands and unaffected siblings):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure disorder, mental retardation, organic brain damage or other neurological&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any (excepting nicotine-related) DSM5-defined moderate to severe substance&#xD;
             use disorder (or DSM-IV-defined substance dependence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cumulative lifetime history of any (excepting nicotine-related) DSM5-defined mild&#xD;
             substance use disorder (or any DSM-IV-defined substance abuse), either in excess of 5&#xD;
             years total or not in remission for at least 6 months.&#xD;
