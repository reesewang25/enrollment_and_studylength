      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economically disadvantaged Southeast Asian men were targeted because of their higher than&#xD;
      average smoking prevalence rate, their extraordinary increased numbers, and the relative&#xD;
      paucity of strategies to reach this hard-to-reach group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained, lay S.E. Asian counselors (cadre) were the primary agents for this study's&#xD;
      assessment, intervention, and follow -up of smoking cessation behaviors. Seven reasons for&#xD;
      using this approach were cited, including the potential generalization of this approach to&#xD;
      other populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the six year demonstration and education research study period, the investigators:&#xD;
      collected baseline data on smoking and smoking cessation behaviors; designed ethnically&#xD;
      approved strategies for the cessation and maintenance of smoking cessation behaviors based&#xD;
      upon findings from the baseline assessment; implemented ethnically approved strategies for&#xD;
      smoking cessation; maintained smoking cessation after initial quitting; and evaluated the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the macro level, an equal number of randomly selected subjects (E1) allocated equally&#xD;
      among the three ethnic groups in one county were compared to an equal number of control&#xD;
      subjects in geographically separate counties. On the micro level, E1 subjects were also&#xD;
      compared to control subjects (C1) in the intervention county. All subjects were&#xD;
      longitudinally followed. The standard for successful cessation was biochemically verified&#xD;
      through salivary cotinine tests at one year of self-reported abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the study's features were the community-based (versus academic or clinical) nature of&#xD;
      lay change agents, the deliberate integration of baseline data and scientific principles with&#xD;
      ethnic values in the intervention approach, and a research design that allowed for both macro&#xD;
      and micro comparisons of the intervention with control conditions.&#xD;
