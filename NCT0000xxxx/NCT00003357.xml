      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from GM2-KLH and given with QS21 may make the body build an immune&#xD;
      response to and kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of GM2-KLH vaccine plus QS21 in treating&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer who have no evidence of disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether immunization with GM2-KLH vaccine plus the immunological&#xD;
      adjuvant QS21 induces an antibody response against GM2 and cells expressing GM2 in disease&#xD;
      free patients at high risk for recurrence of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: GM2-KLH vaccine plus QS21 is administered subcutaneously to sites on the upper arm&#xD;
      and upper leg at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Two additional vaccines are administered at&#xD;
      weeks 12 and 24. Patients are followed every 3 months after the sixth vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.&#xD;
