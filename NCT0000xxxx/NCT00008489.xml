  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare gastrointestinal (stomach and intestines) side&#xD;
      effects of 2 forms of Videx in HIV-infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videx can be an effective anti-HIV treatment but many patients will not take the medication&#xD;
      due to its side effects. Videx EC is a capsule form of the drug and may have fewer side&#xD;
      effects. Also, patients would not have to take as many pills since patients taking Videx EC&#xD;
      would have to take only 1 capsule per day instead of 2 tablets per day. This study will see&#xD;
      if patients taking Videx EC have fewer side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite its therapeutic advantages and proven efficacy in the treatment of HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients, didanosine may continue to be underutilized because many patients experience&#xD;
      undesirable gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and palatability problems. Once-daily dosing&#xD;
      with Videx EC is expected to improve patient adherence with possible improved palatability&#xD;
      and remove the GI side effects associated with the buffers included in the tablet. Videx EC&#xD;
      once-daily dosing would improve pill burden by decreasing from 2 tablets to 1 capsule per&#xD;
      day. Therefore, Videx EC may represent a significant step toward achieving better patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, improved regimen adherence, and optimal virologic outcomes with&#xD;
      Videx-containing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to either continue their current Videx tablet-containing regimen for&#xD;
      an additional 2 weeks or replace their Videx tablets with Videx EC. Patients who remain on&#xD;
      Videx tablets are switched to the EC formulation at Study Week 2 for the remaining 4 weeks of&#xD;
      the study period. For patients who continue and successfully complete the Week 6 study visit,&#xD;
      an optional extended dosing period is offered until Videx EC becomes commercially available&#xD;
      or the study funder terminates the study. Blood specimens for safety evaluations and viral&#xD;
      load are collected at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. For patients participating in the extended&#xD;
      dosing period, the visit schedule is every 8 weeks. Symptom scores between the 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups are compared, with the primary comparison occurring at the Week 2 visit. Analyses&#xD;
      include changes in GSRS scores administered by clinician interview at each study visit.&#xD;
      Assessment of GI symptoms, palatability features, dosing convenience, lifestyle effects, and&#xD;
      Videx preference is evaluated by the patient. Adverse events are assessed objectively by the&#xD;
      observations of both the investigator and the patient.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at least 16 years old (consent of parent or guardian required if under 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking a stable Videx-containing anti-HIV regimen, using Videx tablets either once&#xD;
             or twice a day, for at least 2 weeks prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Score 2 or higher on the GSRS questionnaire for 1 or more of the following symptoms at&#xD;
             the first 2 study visits: abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, borborygmus, abdominal&#xD;
             distension, and loose stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are available for at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking Videx in liquid form, nelfinavir, or amprenavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of pancreatitis or gallstones.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abuse alcohol or require drugs which, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase&#xD;
             the risk of pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had treatment for an active opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection within 4 weeks&#xD;
             of the screening visit. Patients with chronic candidiasis (yeast infection) or&#xD;
             bacterial infection will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are receiving or plan to receive chemotherapy for cancer.&#xD;

          -  Plan to change their medications within 8 weeks following the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are receiving investigational drugs or are participating in a clinical trial involving&#xD;
             anti-HIV medications. Patients in Phase IV studies (studies that evaluate the&#xD;
             long-term safety and effectiveness of a drug, usually after the drug has been approved&#xD;
             by the FDA) may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active, ongoing gastrointestinal disease or infection such as colitis,&#xD;
             diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, peptic ulcer disease, giardiasis, or&#xD;
             cryptosporidiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
