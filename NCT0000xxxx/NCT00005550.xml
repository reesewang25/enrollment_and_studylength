      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotoxin (or lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) is a potent inflammatory stimulant which is found in&#xD;
      ambient air in occupational settings. Asthma in the workplace is an increasingly significant&#xD;
      problem. Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and increased reactivity to both&#xD;
      allergic and non-allergic stimuli. LPS is known to induced airway inflammation in normal&#xD;
      subjects and to enhance airway reactivity in asthmatics. Additionally, both alveolar&#xD;
      macrophages and mononuclear cells from asthmatics secrete higher amounts of cytokines&#xD;
      (interleukins 1 and 8 [IL-1, IL-8] and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      [GM-CSF] ) than those from normals. Thus, it is likely that LPS enhances allergen-induced&#xD;
      inflammation and that allergic asthmatics are more sensitive to the effects of LPS.&#xD;
      Preliminary data show that exposure to low levels (250 ng/m3) of LPS at risk for four hours&#xD;
      enhances both immediate responsiveness to inhaled allergen and allergen-induced eosinophils&#xD;
      as observed in induced sputum. In the nasal airways of allergics, a single dose of 1,000&#xD;
      nanograms of LPS enhances polymorphonuclear leukocyte influx associated with allergen&#xD;
      challenge. This latter finding also correlates well with baseline IL-8 and ECP levels,&#xD;
      suggesting that constitutive airway inflammation enhances response to these stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of endotoxin LPS (5,000 nanograms) is compared on airway inflammation and&#xD;
      methacholine response and lung function in normals and asthmatics; the effect of LPS (500&#xD;
      nanograms) is compared on allergen-induced reactivity and inflammatory cell influx following&#xD;
      LPS exposure (5,000 nanograms) in asthmatics, likely as a result of decreasing baseline&#xD;
      inflammation. To examine potential cellular mediation of the effect of LPS in asthma,&#xD;
      cytokine secretion of mononuclear cells to LPS of subjects responding to LPS (or those in&#xD;
      whom LPS enhance response to allergen) is compared to those who did not respond. In vitro&#xD;
      monocyte and in vivo airway responses of asthmatics who are responsive and non-responsive is&#xD;
      compared to baseline sputum and nasal lavage fluid IL-8 and ECP to determine if either in&#xD;
      vitro monocyte responses or IL-8 and ECP in readily obtained airway fluids may serve as&#xD;
      biomarkers of LPS responsiveness and might be used as a marker for a LPS-response phenotype&#xD;
      in humans for future mechanistic and intervention studies. Finally, practical data on the&#xD;
      effect of LPS in asthmatics (at levels found in typical work settings) and the ability of&#xD;
      standard anti-inflammatory therapy to protect asthmatic workers unavoidable exposed to LPS&#xD;
      will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 2001 and continues through December, 2005.&#xD;
