  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate the functional activity&#xD;
      of the brain. The PET technique allows doctors to study the normal biochemical and metabolic&#xD;
      processes of the central nervous system of normal individuals and patients with neurologic&#xD;
      illnesses without physical / structural damage to the brain. Radioactive water H215O in PET&#xD;
      scans permits good visualization of areas of the brain related to speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the PET scan studies conducted have concentrated on learning about how language is&#xD;
      formed and decoded. Few studies have been conducted on speech production. This study aims to&#xD;
      use radioactive water (H215O) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET scan) to measure blood&#xD;
      flow to different areas of the brain in order to better understand the mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      speech motor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar&#xD;
      (glucose). As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and&#xD;
      water. Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain. As brain&#xD;
      activity increases blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also. Knowing these&#xD;
      facts, researchers can use radioactive chemicals (H215O) and PET scans to observe what areas&#xD;
      of the brain are receiving more blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will ask patients to perform tasks that will affect speech, voice, and language.&#xD;
      At the same time patients will undergo a PET scan. The tasks are designed to help researchers&#xD;
      observe the blood flow to brain areas associated with voicebox (laryngeal) functions,&#xD;
      movement of muscles in the jaw, tongue, and mouth, and other aspects of motor speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special studies will be conducted to evaluate how certain therapies and tasks can draw out&#xD;
      symptoms in illnesses in which speech and language are affected. Results of these tests will&#xD;
      be used in other studies to evaluate the neurologic mechanisms of diseases like Tourette's&#xD;
      syndrome and parkinson's disease.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this protocol is to use multimodal neuroimaging combining&#xD;
      complementary electrophysiological and hemodynamic methods to characterize brain-language&#xD;
      relationships in healthy subjects and those with neurological disorders that affect speech&#xD;
      and language. A secondary objective is to utilize these findings to develop evaluation&#xD;
      measures for future treatment studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will focus on four neurological disorders that affect language processing post-stroke&#xD;
      aphasia, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and developmental stuttering. Each constitutes a&#xD;
      significant clinical problem central to the NIDCD s mission. These disorders can impair&#xD;
      language at several levels - from its elementary perceptual and motor features, the&#xD;
      peripheral building blocks of language, to higher levels of language formulation, including&#xD;
      word, sentence and narrative processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will utilize a set of tasks designed to evaluate language at the levels at which clinical&#xD;
      pathology emerges. We will combine hemodynamic (functional MRI) and electrophysiological&#xD;
      (EEG, MEG) modalities to capitalize on the superior spatial resolution of the former and&#xD;
      temporal resolution of the latter methods. Whenever possible the same task paradigms are used&#xD;
      with both techniques. We will conduct crosssectional sub-studies, addressing specific&#xD;
      questions in each of the disorders of interest; we will also conduct longitudinal sub-studies&#xD;
      of recovery and neuroplastic reorganization in post-stroke aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures include speech-language and psychological tests, measures of behavioral&#xD;
      performance during scanning and corresponding MRI, EEG and MEG data. Relationships between&#xD;
      these datasets will be evaluated using statistical analytic packages.&#xD;
