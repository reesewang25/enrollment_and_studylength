  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder occurs in patients who have experienced, witnessed or have been&#xD;
      confronted with an event involving actual death or the threat of death, serious injury, or&#xD;
      the threat to physical health and felt fear, helplessness, or horror. As a result, patients&#xD;
      continue to re-experience, recollect, dream, or have flashbacks about the traumatic incident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on PTSD continues to show metabolic changes in specific areas of the brain in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with PTSD. For example, neuroimaging studies (functional MRI and PET&#xD;
      scans) reveal that blood flow and glucose utilization increases in the right frontal, limbic,&#xD;
      and paralimbic areas of the brain in patients with PTSD, particularly when they are recalling&#xD;
      the traumatic event associated with their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential method for interfering with the neuronal circuitry associated with traumatic&#xD;
      memories is through the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This&#xD;
      technique involves the placement of a cooled electromagnet with a figure-eight coil on the&#xD;
      patient's scalp and rapidly turning on and off the magnetic flux. This permits non-invasive,&#xD;
      relatively localized stimulation of the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation varies, depending upon the location, intensity and frequency of the&#xD;
      magnetic pulses. Preliminary clinical data shows that low frequency rTMS stimulation leads to&#xD;
      a decrease in regional cerebral blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine if rTMS stimulation in patients diagnosed with PTSD leads&#xD;
      to symptomatic improvement, reductions in blood flow to specific areas of the brain, and&#xD;
      improvements in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A growing body of data indicates that patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have&#xD;
      regionally selective alterations in brain metabolism and processing of information. For&#xD;
      example, neuroimaging studies reveal increased blood flow and glucose utilization in right&#xD;
      frontal, limbic and paralimibic brain structures in patients with PTSD, particularly when&#xD;
      they are recalling the traumatic event associated with their symptoms. These alterations in&#xD;
      regional brain activity are thought to be related, in part, to the distressing emotional&#xD;
      symptoms associated with traumatic memories. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) dysregulation is&#xD;
      common in PTSD, with sympathetic hyper-reactivity and relative lack of parasympathetic&#xD;
      modulation. In addition, abnormalities in hormone levels such as thyroid hormones and the&#xD;
      hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal axis have been demonstrated. Repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation may provide a non-invasive technique for normalizing the alterations in regional&#xD;
      brain metabolism, possibly leading to improvements in PTSD symptoms and concomitant&#xD;
      improvement in ANS and hormonal balance. In particular, preliminary clinical data indicate&#xD;
      that low frequency (i.e., approximately 0.9-1 Hz) rTMS stimulation leads to a decrease in&#xD;
      regional cerebral blood flow. The purpose of the present study is to determine, using a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel design, whether right frontal rTMS stimulation in patients with&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder leads to symptomatic improvement, reductions in hemispheric&#xD;
      regional blood flow, and improvements in ANS regulation. The study hypothesis is that 1 Hz&#xD;
      right frontal rTMS stimulation will be superior to sham stimulation in reducing PTSD symptoms&#xD;
      and physiology including improving abnormalities in regional cerebral blood flow, vagal tone,&#xD;
      and circulating hormone levels.&#xD;
