      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and will examine&#xD;
      whether it causes an immune response to HIV virus proteins. A vaccine is given to try to&#xD;
      create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made&#xD;
      from DNA (genetic material) of two HIV proteins called &quot;gag&quot; and &quot;pol.&quot; Injected into a&#xD;
      human, the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This&#xD;
      study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study&#xD;
      participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or proteins that may be made from&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will provide a medical history, including information on sexual activity and drug&#xD;
      use. They will have a physical examination, blood tests, urine test and chest X-ray. All&#xD;
      candidates enrolled in the study must use a barrier method of contraception for sexual&#xD;
      intercourse from the start of the study until 3 months after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of two treatment groups: one will receive the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine; the other will receive a control substance (inactive salt solution).&#xD;
      The first five people assigned to the vaccine group will receive the lowest study dose of the&#xD;
      vaccine. If this dose is safe, it will be increased three times for the next group of five&#xD;
      and then eight times for the last group of five. Each group will have a total of seven people&#xD;
      - five will receive the vaccine and two will get the salt solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first injection, and possibly the second and third, a catheter (thin plastic tube)&#xD;
      will be placed into a vein so that treatment can be given quickly if there is a reaction to&#xD;
      the vaccine. Participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection&#xD;
      a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector. For each injection,&#xD;
      the volunteer will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  record temperature and symptoms, including any effects at the injection site, for 2 days&#xD;
           and report them to the clinic staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immediately report any side effects to a study physician or nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will have physical examinations and laboratory tests at certain times while they&#xD;
      receive the vaccine and for a period afterwards. These procedures will require about 14&#xD;
      clinic visits of about 1 to 2 hours each, and up to 6 hours on vaccination days. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn at all visits. Some of the blood will be used for genetic tests, and some will be&#xD;
      stored for future tests of the immune system and the body's response to the study vaccine.&#xD;
      The study will last about 12 months from the date of the first injection. After it is&#xD;
      completed, clinic staff may contact volunteers once or twice a year for at least 3 years to&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I randomized, controlled, double-blinded dose escalation study to examine&#xD;
      toxicity, dose and immune response of an HIV plasmid DNA vaccine. The vector used in this&#xD;
      study has been optimized for improved safety, expression and immunogenicity. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that this vaccine will elicit immune responses to HIV. All work will be conducted at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, HIV-negative volunteers will be recruited and pre-screened to confirm that they meet&#xD;
      all of the eligibility requirements for participation. Educational materials on DNA vaccines&#xD;
      will be reviewed with and provided to participants before enrollment into the study. There&#xD;
      will be 3 groups of 7 volunteers. Each group will receive a constant dose of the vaccine&#xD;
      pGag(del fs)Pol delta PR delta RT delta IN/h (5 people) or a phosphate buffered saline (PBS)&#xD;
      control (2 people) by intramuscular inoculation. Once safety has been established, successive&#xD;
      groups will receive a higher dose. Study groups will receive three immunizations containing&#xD;
      either 0.5 mg (Group 1), 1.5 mg (Group 2), or 4.0 mg (Group 3) of a DNA vaccine. Dose&#xD;
      escalation will be initiated 5 weeks after the last volunteer in the previous dose group&#xD;
      receives their first inoculation, providing there are no significant toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine-related adverse reactions will be evaluated at scheduled study visits and by study&#xD;
      participant report. Immune response will be evaluated as described in Appendix II. Specimens&#xD;
      to evaluate immunogenicity will be taken at baseline, and at the time points indicated in&#xD;
      Appendix VIII. Unless contraindicated, subsequent inoculations using repeat plasmid&#xD;
      vaccinations will be given 28 and 56 days after the first vaccinations. The estimated&#xD;
      duration for each volunteer to complete immunizations and follow-up is 12 months.&#xD;
