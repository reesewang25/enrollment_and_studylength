  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if nitazoxanide (NTZ) can be used to treat AIDS patients&#xD;
      suffering from cryptosporidiosis (diarrhea caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients receive oral nitazoxanide daily for 14 days, after which those with complete&#xD;
      clinical and parasitologic response discontinue treatment. Non-responders and partial&#xD;
      responders may continue therapy for an additional 14 days at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
      Non-responders who show signs of improvement or who have partial response after 28 days and&#xD;
      those who relapse following complete response may continue therapy for an additional month,&#xD;
      up to 60 days total. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/30/96: Patients receive a daily treatment for 4&#xD;
      weeks, with subsequent dose escalation in the absence of drug-related toxicity. Patients who&#xD;
      exhibit complete response after 2 months may continue at a maintenance dose. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled after October 15, 1996 are randomized to 1 of 2 doses, with subsequent escalations&#xD;
      made in the absence of toxicity. Complete responders may continue therapy at a maintenance&#xD;
      dose and duration determined by the investigator. Non-responders after 6 months of therapy&#xD;
      have treatment discontinued.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/5/97: All patients are evaluated at Weeks&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, and monthly thereafter.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/17/99: New patients start therapy on a&#xD;
      different dosage of nitazoxanide. Those who do not respond after 4 weeks of therapy will&#xD;
      escalate to a higher dosage. Patients who show a complete response at 2 consecutive visits (2&#xD;
      weeks apart) discontinue nitazoxanide therapy and go to follow-up.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/3/00:&#xD;
      The Week 1 clinical evaluation is deleted from the study procedures.]&#xD;
