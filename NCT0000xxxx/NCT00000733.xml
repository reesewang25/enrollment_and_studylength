  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine how fast ribavirin reaches the bloodstream, what concentration of ribavirin is&#xD;
      reached in blood and how long it remains in the blood (pharmacokinetics) when given by&#xD;
      different routes of administration. To find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ribavirin.&#xD;
      The effects of ribavirin on the immune system, and on the virus will be measured by T4 cell&#xD;
      count and p24 antigen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early studies with ribavirin in patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) have shown&#xD;
      that ribavirin appears to inhibit the spread of the virus. Determination of how much and how&#xD;
      often to give the drug will require further knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of&#xD;
      the drug in patients with AIDS or ARC and in chronic virus carriers who do not have symptoms.&#xD;

      Early studies with ribavirin in patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) have shown&#xD;
      that ribavirin appears to inhibit the spread of the virus. Determination of how much and how&#xD;

      the drug in patients with AIDS or ARC and in chronic virus carriers who do not have symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavirin is given to HIV-infected patients intravenously as a timed 30-min infusion at 1 of&#xD;
      5 single doses; 2 weeks later, the same doses are given orally in a single dose. Following at&#xD;
      least 2 additional weeks, 6 patients are then given ribavirin at the lowest dose twice a day&#xD;
      for 16 weeks. They are evaluated for tolerance and the next group is given a higher dose.&#xD;
      Each successive group begins at 3-week intervals to receive doses that increase each day&#xD;
      until the MTD is reached. Blood samples taken periodically during the treatment period and&#xD;
      for 8 weeks after treatment is stopped are used to measure blood levels of ribavirin and to&#xD;
      determine the effects of ribavirin on the HIV and immune system of the patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be asymptomatic according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal neurologic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No unintentional weight loss of greater than 10 lbs. or more than 10 percent of usual&#xD;
             body weight within 2 years prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No unexplained temperature above 38 degrees C on more than 5 consecutive days or on&#xD;
             more than 10 days in any 30 days in the 2 years prior to expected entry into the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No unexplained diarrhea defined by equal to or more than 3 liquid stools per day&#xD;
             persisting more than 7 days within 2 years prior to expected entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No active hepatitis of any form. In addition, patients must not have previously had&#xD;
             AIDS or an AIDS related illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Temperature of greater than 37.8 degrees C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Development of an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unexplained diarrhea defined by equal to or more than 3 liquid stools per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hepatitis of any form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had oral candida infection documented by morphology, or by response to&#xD;
        antifungal therapy, or oral hairy leukoplakia, or herpes zoster infection within 2 years of&#xD;
        anticipated study entry at any time will be excluded. Patients with a prior history of a&#xD;
        malignancy other than cutaneous basal cell carcinomas or cervical carcinoma in situ and&#xD;
        patients with a significant chronic underlying medical illness that would impair continuous&#xD;
        participation in the study will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded within 90 days of study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunomodulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active alcohol or drug abuse sufficient in the investigator's opinion to prevent adequate&#xD;
        compliance with the study therapy.&#xD;
