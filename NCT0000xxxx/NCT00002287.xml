        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A prior history of a malignancy other than cutaneous basal cell or cervical&#xD;
             carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other significant, chronic underlying medical illness which, in the physician's&#xD;
             judgment, would impair study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of compromised bone marrow function (lab results) with a blood transfusion&#xD;
             within the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver dysfunction as indicated by lab results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are excluded if there is a prior diagnosis of HIV infection by one of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV antibody positive by ELISA and Western blot assays or by other certified test&#xD;
             method. (Patients who are ELISA positive but Western blot or other confirmatory tests&#xD;
             are negative may continue in study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV antigen positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical symptoms which lead to a diagnosis by a licensed physician of AIDS or AIDS&#xD;
             related complex or AIDS-related dementia. Also excluded are individuals who have&#xD;
             experienced similar HIV exposure as described in this protocol in the past month and&#xD;
             individuals who have previously been enrolled in this study. The purpose of these&#xD;
             exclusions is to eliminate possible seroconversion in an individual that could be&#xD;
             attributed to HIV exposure other than the single exposure experienced just prior to&#xD;
             entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded within 4 weeks of study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any potentially myelosuppressive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nephrotoxic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exposure of a health care worker to HIV-contaminated blood or blood component within 5 days&#xD;
        prior to beginning therapy, defined as one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Penetrating wound from needle recently removed from patient or sample container (e.g.,&#xD;
             blood bag, blood tube) or from sharp object visibly contaminated with HIV-positive&#xD;
             blood or blood component. In the case of needlesticks or cuts with sharp objects,&#xD;
             blood or blood component must not have been exposed to the air for more than 1 hour.&#xD;
             If actual infusion of blood occurs, the 1-hour time limit does not apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypodermic needles should come in contact with the blood and blood component from an&#xD;
             HIV source but need not be visibly contaminated with blood to be considered a source&#xD;
             of contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant exposure to HIV-positive blood or blood component as the result of splash&#xD;
             on abraded skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant exposure to HIV-positive blood or blood component as the result of splash&#xD;
             on mucous membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active drug or alcohol abuse sufficient in the physician's opinion to prevent compliance&#xD;
        with the study regimen.&#xD;
