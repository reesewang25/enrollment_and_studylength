  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of visual&#xD;
      loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause significant&#xD;
      adverse effects. Consequently, an effective treatment with a safer side effect profile is&#xD;
      highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study has permitted enrollment of up to 12 adults with non-infectious intermediate&#xD;
      or posterior uveitis who require treatments to maintain visual function. This extended&#xD;
      protocol began with an evaluation of the safety and potential efficacy of intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      daclizumab treatments for uveitis while reducing or eliminating standard medications&#xD;
      commensurate with the standard of care. As subcutaneous (SC) daclizumab treatments become&#xD;
      available, eligible participants will be offered continuing daclizumab treatments using the&#xD;
      new SC formulation, though they may elect to remain on the IV treatments. If the therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit is sustained using the SC formulation, maintenance therapy will continue as&#xD;
      clinically indicated. Participants who repeatedly fail the SC therapy will be permitted to&#xD;
      revert to the IV daclizumab regimen they previously used, or may exit the study as treatment&#xD;
      failures. SC treatments begin with a short SC induction at 2 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg&#xD;
      treatments on a 4-week schedule as the protocol originally specified. Participants will be&#xD;
      monitored routinely when each dose is received and additionally will participate in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies to monitor SC formulation bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daclizumab is a humanized anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (HAT, Zenapax) that interferes with&#xD;
      inflammatory processes by its involvement with the interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R). During the&#xD;
      first 5 years of this study, only an IV product was available. The SC formulation is now&#xD;
      available containing the same daclizumab drug product. Preliminary studies indicate that the&#xD;
      SC formulation is well tolerated by normal control subjects and other autoimmune disease&#xD;
      patients at repeated doses up to 2 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to examine the safety and potential efficacy of IV and later, SC&#xD;
      daclizumab, while continuing to reduce other immunosuppressive medications commensurate with&#xD;
      the standard of care. Primary safety outcomes are the discontinuation of study therapy due to&#xD;
      reduced vision or the occurrence of adverse events. Secondary outcome measures include visual&#xD;
      acuity and the grading of immunosuppressive medications, anterior chamber and vitreous cells,&#xD;
      and vitreous haze.&#xD;
