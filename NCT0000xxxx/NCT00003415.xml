      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells&#xD;
      from the side effects of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine plus topotecan in treating&#xD;
      patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the hematologic and cytogenetic response to treatment with amifostine&#xD;
      plus topotecan in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Evaluate the toxic effects of&#xD;
      this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate the effects of this treatment on bone marrow&#xD;
      recovery in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients receive amifostine IV&#xD;
      followed by topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 every 4-8 weeks for at least two&#xD;
      courses. Patients who are responding after two courses of induction receive maintenance&#xD;
      courses every 6-8 weeks for up to ten courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level of topotecan.&#xD;
      The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
