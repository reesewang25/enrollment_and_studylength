  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of giving healthy&#xD;
      volunteers a new oral HIV vaccine which has been incorporated into a bacterial cell. This&#xD;
      oral vaccine (HIV-1 LAI gp120) will be given with or without a different injected HIV vaccine&#xD;
      (HIV-1 MN rgp120).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines are preparations that are introduced into the body to try to prevent infection or&#xD;
      create resistance to infection. This study examines a new oral vaccine to see if it can&#xD;
      improve the immune system's ability to fight the HIV virus when given alone or with another&#xD;
      injected vaccine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy for AIDS, there is no cure for&#xD;
      HIV-1 infection or AIDS, and drug therapy is too expensive for most affected populations. The&#xD;
      development of safe, effective vaccines to prevent HIV-1 infection and AIDS worldwide is a&#xD;
      global priority. One promising approach in the development of HIV-1 vaccines utilizes live&#xD;
      vaccines as vectors to express HIV-1 antigens. The potential advantages of the live vector&#xD;
      approach include the ability of live vector recombinants to induce long-lasting humoral and&#xD;
      cell-mediated immunity (particularly neutralizing antibody and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell&#xD;
      activity) and the relatively low cost of production. Moreover, live vector recombinant&#xD;
      vaccines administered orally might be able to stimulate the production of secretory IgA&#xD;
      vaccine-specific antibodies locally at relevant mucosal sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I of this study is conducted as an open-label, dose-escalation trial. The first 5&#xD;
      volunteers (Group A) receive a single oral dose of Salmonella typhi CVD 908-HIV-1 LAI gp 120&#xD;
      (VVG203). If no typhoid fever-like illness is seen in these volunteers during at least 14&#xD;
      days of follow-up, the next 5 patients (Group B) receive a single dose of VVG203. If this&#xD;
      higher dose is well-tolerated, Phase II of the study is initiated once all Phase I volunteers&#xD;
      have been assessed for safety for at least 21 days. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97: Groups A and&#xD;
      B are expanded to 10 patients each.] Part II of this study is a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Nine volunteers are randomized to each of treatment&#xD;
      groups, with oral VVG203 given alone or sequentially with HIV-1 SF-2 rgp 120 in MF59 (SF)&#xD;
      given intramuscularly. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97: Randomization is to VVG 203 alone or&#xD;
      sequentially with HIV-1 MN rgp120 in alum (MN).] A total of 3 vaccinations are administered&#xD;
      within each 9-person cohort, 1 volunteer serves as a control and receives a sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate buffer rather than VVG203 or a vaccine placebo rather than SF. Group C receives&#xD;
      VVG at Month 0 and SF at Months 2 and 6. Group D receives VVG at Months 0, 2, and 6. Group E&#xD;
      receives SF at Months 0 and 2 and VVG at Month 6. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97: MN is given in&#xD;
      place of SF in all Groups C, D, and E.]&#xD;
