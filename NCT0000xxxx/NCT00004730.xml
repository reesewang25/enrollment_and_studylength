  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether magnesium sulfate, given within 8 hours of a&#xD;
      moderate or severe traumatic brain injury improves survival, decreases the number of people&#xD;
      developing seizures, improves the survivors' mental and psychological functioning, including&#xD;
      the ability to return to daily life, live independently, and return to work or school.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to determine if treating head-injured patients with magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate will improve medical, mental, and psychological recovery. In particular, the study&#xD;
      will assess each patient's ability to return to daily life, live independently, and return to&#xD;
      work or school as done before the head injury occurred. The study will also assess magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate's ability to reduce the risk of developing seizures (epilepsy) as well as to improve&#xD;
      survival rates after a traumatic brain injury. Patients on the study are assigned randomly&#xD;
      (by chance) to either the magnesium sulfate group or the group which gets a placebo. This&#xD;
      means they have an equal chance of being in either group. Before the first dose is given, two&#xD;
      teaspoons worth of blood are drawn from a vein in the arm. The first dose of magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate is 1meq/kg given intravenously within 8 hours of injury. Then a five day continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate 0.24meq/kg per hour is begun. Daily magnesium&#xD;
      levels are checked and the dose changed in order to keep the Magnesium blood level at&#xD;
      approximately 4meq/L. If the person does not receive magnesium sulfate, he receives a placebo&#xD;
      which looks just like magnesium sulfate but contains no active medication. If the person&#xD;
      leaves the hospital before the five days are over, the magnesium or placebo is stopped.&#xD;
      Patients on the study will receive a brief exam in person or over the phone at one and three&#xD;
      months after the injury to determine whether they have had any seizures and to evaluate how&#xD;
      they are functioning and recovering from their head injury. Each evaluation will last about&#xD;
      one hour. At six months after the injury, they will have full neuropsychological and&#xD;
      psychosocial evaluations done at Harborview. These tests will take about five hours to&#xD;
      complete and include tests of vocabulary, problem solving, and coordination. There will be&#xD;
      questions about how the injury has affected the way they feel and interact socially. For&#xD;
      example, there will be questions about their ability to work, manage personal affairs, what&#xD;
      their moods are like, and how anger is handled.&#xD;
