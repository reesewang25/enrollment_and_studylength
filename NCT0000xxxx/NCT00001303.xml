    <textblock>
      Bacterial infections can progress to a life-threatening illness called septic shock,&#xD;
      characterized by low blood pressure and vital organ damage. The syndrome is thought to be&#xD;
      caused by parts of the bacteria and by the body s own immune response to the infection. A&#xD;
      major bacterial product that interacts with the immune defenses is called endotoxin. This&#xD;
      study will examine the body s response to endotoxin in the lungs or bloodstream. When&#xD;
      endotoxin is given in small amounts to humans, even though it is not an infection, it&#xD;
      triggers a set of responses that are typical of what one would see with a true bacterial&#xD;
      infection. This allows us to study the earliest changes in molecules and cells that are&#xD;
      involved in some bacterial infections. This type of model is safe and has been used in humans&#xD;
      for many years to understand the body s responses during infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers 18 to 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have&#xD;
      a history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest&#xD;
      X-ray. In addition, volunteers 40 to 45 years old will have an exercise stress test to screen&#xD;
      for asymptomatic coronary artery disease. Participants will undergo one or more of the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy, Bronchoalveolar Lavage, Bronchial Brushings, and Endobronchial Mucosal&#xD;
      Biopsies: These techniques for examining lung function are used routinely in patient care and&#xD;
      clinical research. The mouth and nasal and lung airways are numbed with an anesthetic. A&#xD;
      bronchoscope (pencil-thin flexible tube) is then passed through the nose into the large&#xD;
      airways of the lung. Cells and secretions from the airways are rinsed with salt water&#xD;
      (bronchoalveolar lavage) and a flexible brush the size of a pencil tip is passed through the&#xD;
      bronchoscope to scrape cells lining the airways. Lastly, pieces of tissue (the size of the&#xD;
      ball of a ballpoint pen) lining the airways are removed for examination under the microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous Endotoxin: A small dose of endotoxin is injected into a vein. Blood samples are&#xD;
      drawn at regular intervals for 8 hours after the injection and again after 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14&#xD;
      days to analyze the body s immune response to the bacteria in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instilled Endotoxin in the Lungs: A small amount (2 teaspoons) of salt water is squirted&#xD;
      through a bronchoscope into a lobe of one lung, and then salt water containing a small dose&#xD;
      of endotoxin is squirted into the other lung. Bronchial lavage, brushing, and biopsy (see&#xD;
      above) are then done to study the response of the lung to the endotoxin. In addition, air is&#xD;
      withdrawn through the bronchoscope to study air components from the lung that was instilled&#xD;
      with salt water or endotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide Therapy: Endotoxin is instilled in a lung (see above) and then nitric oxide a&#xD;
      colorless, odorless, tasteless gas mixed with room air in a concentration of 40 parts per&#xD;
      million, is given through a cushioned mask placed over the mouth and nose. (Some participants&#xD;
      will be given the nitric oxide mixture and others will breathe only room air through the mask&#xD;
      to test the effects of the nitric oxide on the lung inflammation.) The mask will be worn&#xD;
      continuously for 6 hours and removed before repeat bronchoscopy with lavage, brushing and&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the above procedures require placement of a catheter (thin plastic tube) in a wrist&#xD;
      artery to monitor blood pressure from heartbeat to heartbeat and to collect blood samples.&#xD;
      First, the skin is numbed with an anesthetic (lidocaine). A needle is then inserted into the&#xD;
      artery, the catheter is slipped over the needle into the vessel, and the needle is removed.&#xD;

      Endotoxin is a unique molecule because it represents an important probe for investigating the&#xD;
      humoral and cellular basis of septic shock. Endotoxin administration to humans provides an&#xD;
      opportunity to evaluate the earliest responses that are activated after exposure to an&#xD;
      important bacterial component. Many alterations in organ function and circulating mediators&#xD;
      can be evaluated in this model. These changes are qualitatively similar to changes that occur&#xD;
      during sepsis and septic shock. The applications of new technologies to this model are useful&#xD;
      adjuncts to define mechanisms of acute inflammatory responses. Defining these pathways and&#xD;
      their interactions may allow a better understanding of the factors that can be controlled or&#xD;
      altered during critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we are planning to extend previous observations on heart and lung&#xD;
      function after endotoxin administration in four separate studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial brushings in normal subjects. Bronchoalveolar&#xD;
           lavage and bronchial brushings will be performed in normal subjects to obtain alveolar&#xD;
           and epithelial pulmonary cells for use in vitro assays of respiratory cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inflammatory effects of systemic endotoxin administration. In order to evaluate late&#xD;
           inflammatory responses to IV endotoxin, blood will be obtained acutely and at 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
           7, and 14 days post endotoxin challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulmonary effects of instilled endotoxin. Using bronchoscopy, the effects of direct&#xD;
           instillation of endotoxin into a lobe of the lung is being used to assess local&#xD;
           pulmonary inflammatory responses that result in neutrophil influx into the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Effects of inhaled nitric oxide on pulmonary inflammatory responses following endotoxin&#xD;
           administration. In order to systematically study the effects of inhaled nitric oxide on&#xD;
           local lung inflammation, healthy subjects will undergo local endotoxin instillation,&#xD;
           breath NO through a mask for 6h, and then a repeat bronchoscopy will be done at 6h to&#xD;
           assess the ability of NO to suppress local inflammation in the lung.&#xD;
