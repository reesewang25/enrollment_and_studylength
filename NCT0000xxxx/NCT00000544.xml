      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strong relationship between diet and blood pressure and the risk of hypertension has been&#xD;
      well recognized. Currently, three specific diet-related factors have been recommended by the&#xD;
      Joint National Committee on High Blood Pressure as a first-line approach in preventing and&#xD;
      treating hypertension: caloric restriction for weight reduction, reduced consumption of&#xD;
      alcohol, and lower sodium intake. Many studies, primarily observational, have shown&#xD;
      significant associations between blood pressure and other diet-related factors, including&#xD;
      micronutrients such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium; macronutrients such as type and&#xD;
      amount of dietary fats, particularly polyunsaturated, and protein; and dietary fiber.&#xD;
      However, results from individual, randomized, controlled clinical trials testing the effects&#xD;
      of these nutrients on blood pressure have been inconsistent and equivocal. On the other hand,&#xD;
      both observational and randomized intervention studies have consistently linked vegetarian&#xD;
      dietary patterns to lower blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine which specific dietary component may account for the blood pressure-lowering&#xD;
      effect produced by vegetarian diets, numerous studies have examined individual&#xD;
      micronutrients, macronutrients, and fiber. A large majority of cross-cultural and&#xD;
      observational studies have shown a significant inverse association of blood pressure with the&#xD;
      micronutrients, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, while the evidence linking dietary fiber&#xD;
      to lower blood pressure comes primarily from studies on vegetarian and other high fiber&#xD;
      diets. However, only a few of numerous clinical trials found that potassium or calcium&#xD;
      supplements lower blood pressure. Randomized trials of magnesium supplementation generally&#xD;
      have not shown a significant reduction in blood pressure. The few intervention studies of&#xD;
      fiber supplements likewise generally have not demonstrated significant lowering of blood&#xD;
      pressure. Pooled estimates from meta-analyses of potassium and calcium trials have reported&#xD;
      small but significant reductions in systolic (potassium and calcium) and diastolic&#xD;
      (potassium) blood pressure. All of these results are compatible with small effects of&#xD;
      individual dietary components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few observational and intervention studies have demonstrated a relationship between&#xD;
      the macronutrients, dietary fats or protein, and blood pressure. However, recent data&#xD;
      analyses shown significant direct associations with saturated fat and dietary cholesterol,&#xD;
      and inverse associations with protein intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, an overall summary of the literature suggests that there is strong potential for a&#xD;
      number of macronutrients and micronutrients to play an important role in reducing blood&#xD;
      pressure. Testing dietary patterns rather than specific nutrients is a promising approach&#xD;
      because it is not yet known which nutrients might be most effective in lowering blood&#xD;
      pressure and because the effect of individual nutrients may be small. Testing dietary&#xD;
      patterns would naturally include several nutrients that cumulatively are likely to lower&#xD;
      blood pressure. Furthermore, most intervention studies which have not demonstrated decreases&#xD;
      in blood pressure from individual nutrients used supplements rather than foods. Therefore, it&#xD;
      may be important to test nutrients as components of foods and dietary patterns and not as&#xD;
      isolated or processed nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DASH, a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial, compared the effects of three dietary&#xD;
      patterns on blood pressure. The study design consisted of a three-week run-in period during&#xD;
      which eligible participants were provided a diet that approximated a typical American diet in&#xD;
      nutrient content. After run-in, eligible participants were randomized to one of three dietary&#xD;
      patterns which lasted for eight weeks: a 'typical' American diet in which the macronutrient&#xD;
      and fiber content reflected current United States consumption and was relatively low in&#xD;
      calcium, potassium, and magnesium; a diet that was high in fruits and vegetables, and&#xD;
      therefore high in potassium, magnesium, and fiber. The macronutrient and calcium content of&#xD;
      this diet otherwise resembled that of the typical American diet. The third diet, termed the&#xD;
      DASH diet, was high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and had a favorable&#xD;
      macronutrient profile. This diet was low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, was&#xD;
      moderately high in protein, and had a high content of calcium, potassium, magnesium, and&#xD;
      fiber. All three diets had about 3 grams of sodium daily--slightly below the average U.S.&#xD;
      consumption-- and all included fresh, frozen, canned, and dried foods. None of the diets was&#xD;
      vegetarian or used specialty foods containing fat substitutes. Alcohol and&#xD;
      caffeine-containing beverages were limited and monitored. Because it was important that good&#xD;
      compliance to the diet be assured, food was provided to the free-living study participants.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was change in diastolic blood pressure from baseline to the end of the&#xD;
      study. The study compared the changes in diastolic blood pressure among the three dietary&#xD;
      patterns. Screening began in June 1994. Randomization began in September 1994 and was&#xD;
      expected to take two years. Support for the trial ended in July 1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHLBI funded an ancillary study of DASH entitled, Folic Acid Dose Response. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study was to determine the dose-response relationship between dietary folic acid intake&#xD;
      and plasma folate and homocysteine. A total of 133 healthy people aged 60 years or older were&#xD;
      enrolled. Participants were assigned to either 0, 100, 400, 1000, or 2000 micrograms of folic&#xD;
      acid for 6 weeks. Study participants were newly recruited and were not DASH participants.&#xD;
