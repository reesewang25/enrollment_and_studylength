    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are abnormally formed blood vessels that can be located&#xD;
      throughout the brain and spinal cord. Patients with abnormalities of the blood vessels&#xD;
      located in and around the spinal cord can develop many neurological problems. Some problems&#xD;
      include, weakness, pain, difficulty walking, paralysis, and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment for these AVMs depends on their location, the type of malformation, the area of&#xD;
      the spine involved, and the condition of the patient at the time of treatment. The treatment&#xD;
      is aimed at stopping the neurologic problems from worsening and possibly correcting the&#xD;
      existing problems. There are two commonly used treatments for AVMs, surgery and embolization&#xD;
      (blocking off of blood flow to the AVM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, researchers have limited experience treating these conditions because they are rare.&#xD;
      In addition, it has been difficult to classify different kinds of AVMs and to develop new&#xD;
      treatments for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to increase researchers understanding of AVMs by admitting and&#xD;
      following patients diagnosed with the condition. By increasing the amount of patients studied&#xD;
      diagnosed with spinal blood vessel abnormalities, researchers can begin to develop new&#xD;
      management plans for patients with AVMs.&#xD;

      Spinal Arteriovenous Malformations are rare lesions that frequently effect young patients and&#xD;
      adults in their most productive years. They cause progressive myelopathy, ultimately causing&#xD;
      paraplegia or quadriplegia if untreated. Because they are rare lesions, experience with&#xD;
      treating them in sufficient numbers to permit classification of them, investigation of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of myelopathy, and the introduction of new techniques for treatment has been&#xD;
      possible in only a very few centers in this country. One essential element of investigation&#xD;
      of them is selective spinal arteriography. Since selective spinal arteriography was first&#xD;
      introduced for these lesions here at the NIH in the mid 1960's by Drs. John Doppman and&#xD;
      Giovanni DiChiro, the NIH has been such a center of expertise for patients with spinal&#xD;
      arteriovenous malformations. Because of this, NIH has been, and is, a national referral&#xD;
      center for these patients. However, there has never been an approved protocol at the NIH for&#xD;
      investigation or treatment of these patients. The purpose of this proposal is to present a&#xD;
      plan of investigation and treatment which will serve as a protocol under which to admit these&#xD;
      patients and to permit continued accrual of clinical experience with them that will serve to&#xD;
      guide others in the management of these patients.&#xD;
