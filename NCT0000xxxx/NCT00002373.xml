    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple escalating doses of 1263W94 administered&#xD;
      orally for 28 days in HIV infected patients with asymptomatic CMV shedding. To obtain&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of the in vivo anti CMV activity of different doses of 1263W94 in humans&#xD;
      based on quantitative reduction of CMV load in semen and if possible in other biological&#xD;
      fluids and to explore the dose response relationship in the anti-CMV activity of 1263W94.&#xD;

      HIV seropositive men stratified based on CMV titer in semen at the Pre-Screen visit (30 days&#xD;
      prior to entry). Patients with a CMV titer &gt;= 5000 PFU/ml and a positive result upon&#xD;
      qualitative urine CMV culture may be eligible for entry into the main group and patients with&#xD;
      a CMV titer &lt; 5000 PFU/ml may be eligible for entry into the satellite group. Patients will&#xD;
      on 1263W94 for 4 weeks. Patients will be present for clinic visits on study days 1, 7, 14,&#xD;
      21, and 28. They will return to the clinic for post treatment evaluations on study days 42&#xD;
      and 56.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Required of Main group:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum CMV titer of 5000 PFU/ml in semen by quantitative CMV culture on one occasion&#xD;
             within 30 days of entry.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Required of Satellite group:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have CD4+ &lt; 150 c/mm3 (or 10% of total lymphocytes) at screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Required of both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to comply with protocol requirements/instructions and likely to complete all&#xD;
             study visits and evaluations as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stable, chronically administered concomitant therapy for HIV infection and opportunistic&#xD;
