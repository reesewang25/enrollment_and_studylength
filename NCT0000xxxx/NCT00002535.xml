      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop&#xD;
      tumor cells from growing. Combining biological therapies with indomethacin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of indomethacin and biological therapy&#xD;
      with or without cyclophosphamide in treating patients who have advanced melanoma that has not&#xD;
      responded to previous therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether indomethacin given prior to tumor removal can increase the&#xD;
      number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) obtained from the tumor specimen of patients&#xD;
      with advanced melanoma. II. Determine the efficacy of administering concurrent indomethacin&#xD;
      to maximize immune effector cell function in situ during interleukin-2/TIL therapy in these&#xD;
      patients. III. Determine the relationship between the phenotypic character of TIL (generated&#xD;
      in culture from the patient's tumor) and the response to therapy. IV. Correlate the lytic&#xD;
      activity or lymphokine production of TIL (generated in culture from the patient's tumor) with&#xD;
      clinical response to therapy. V. Generate and use lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in&#xD;
      those patients who do not have TIL available for therapy and evaluate LAK cells in the same&#xD;
      manner as TIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients with resectable tumors and with adequate generation of TIL are treated on&#xD;
      Regimen A; those with unresectable tumors or insufficient TIL are treated on Regimen B. The&#xD;
      following acronyms are used: CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 IL-2 Interleukin-2 (Cetus),&#xD;
      NSC-373364 LAK Lymphokine-Activated Killer Cells TIL Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Regimen&#xD;
      A: Prostaglandin Inhibition Therapy plus Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Indomethacin;&#xD;
      plus CTX; IL-2-activated TIL; IL-2. Regimen B: Prostaglandin Inhibition Therapy plus&#xD;
      Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Indomethacin; plus IL-2-activated LAK; IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued over 3 years. If 0 of the first 10&#xD;
      patients, no more than 1 of the first 15 patients, or no more than 2 of the first 20 patients&#xD;
      respond, accrual will cease.&#xD;
