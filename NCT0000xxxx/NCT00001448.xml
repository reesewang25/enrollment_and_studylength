  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are: 1) to determine whether various levels of severity of&#xD;
      oral candidiasis (thrush) in the child are associated with different levels of speech&#xD;
      production, feeding skills, and self-concept, and 2) to assess the effect of the reduction of&#xD;
      oral thrush over time on the speech function, feeding skills, and self-concept in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients who already are receiving various antifungal medications for treatment&#xD;
      of their thrush (Note: Decisions regarding antifungal therapy are made completely independent&#xD;
      from this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with HIV disease, ages 6-21 years, who have oral thrush are eligible to paricipate&#xD;
      in the study. The child and his/her parent will be asked to complete a variety of measures at&#xD;
      specific time intervals over approximately one month during visits to the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health for treatment on other protocols. First, a nurse will rate the location and&#xD;
      severity of thrush in the child's mouth. Then the parent will complete questionnaires&#xD;
      assessing the effect of oral thrush on the child's feeding and speech skills and everyday&#xD;
      functioning. Finally, the child will be administered a brief speech and oral-motor evaluation&#xD;
      and will complete some questionnaires about how the thrush affects his/her day-to-day&#xD;
      activities and self-concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study may help to better understand the cause of expressive language&#xD;
      deficits observed in some children with HIV infection. More specifically, it will determine&#xD;
      if any speech and feeding problems of HIV-infected children are associated with oral thrush.&#xD;
      Learning more about the impact of oral thrush on the speech, feeding, and the self-concept of&#xD;
      children with HIV disease may be used for parent and patient education and to develop&#xD;
      rehabilitative recommendations to benefit HIV-infected patients with oral thrush.&#xD;

      Language impairments in children with symptomatic HIV infection are associated with the&#xD;
      direct effects of HIV on the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, expressive language&#xD;
      is more vulnerable to the effects of HIV compared to receptive language (Wolters, et al.,&#xD;
      1995). Several factors, however, are likely to be involved in producing the expressive&#xD;
      language impairments observed in the HIV-infected pediatric population. Oral candidiasis&#xD;
      (thrush), a fungal infection in the oral cavity that frequently appears in HIV-infected&#xD;
      children (Walsh, 1994), also may contribute to speech and language deficits depending on the&#xD;
      severity of the thrush. Feeding skills and self-concept may be negatively affected by oral&#xD;
      thrush as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of oral candidiasis on the speech production, feeding skills, and self-concept of&#xD;
      children and adolescents with HIV infection will be examined in this pilot study. Several&#xD;
      disciplines (Neuropsychology, Speech, Nursing, and Infectious Disease) will be involved to&#xD;
      investigate the severity of oral candidiasis on various aspects of everyday behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interdisciplinary assessment of the ramifications of oral thrush on speech production and&#xD;
      feeding skills have not been conducted to date in children or adolescents infected with HIV.&#xD;
      Most studies have assessed only single dimensions or functions such as language or they have&#xD;
      yielded only descriptive data, for example, regarding the severity of oral thrush. This pilot&#xD;
      study, however, will investigate the association between oral thrush and speech and feeding&#xD;
      dysfunction using some newly-developed measures. The study will also examine whether oral&#xD;
      candidiasis may influence the self-concept of children and adolescents with HIV infection.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Children and adolescents with HIV infection, ages 6 through 21 years of age, who are&#xD;
        treated in other protocols at the Pediatric Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)&#xD;
        and have oral candidiasis as determined by the Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, are eligible&#xD;
        to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children and adolescents with infections or diseases other than candidiasis affecting the&#xD;
        oral cavity as determined by the PNP's during the physical exam will be excluded from the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Furthermore, patients who are identified by the speech pathologist to have oro-facial&#xD;
        structural and/or functional abnormalities that cause a significant disturbance in speech,&#xD;
        voice, or swallowing will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will also not be able t participate in the study if they cannot understand the&#xD;
        measures, even if the questions are read to them, which will be determined by the&#xD;
        Neuropsychology staff.&#xD;
