  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas, continuously synthesized by the endothelium, that&#xD;
      contributes importantly to vasodilator tone of the coronary and systemic circulations by&#xD;
      activating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation. Although regional&#xD;
      synthesis of NO by the endothelium contributes to local vasodilator tone, Stamler and&#xD;
      co-workers have proposed that regional vascular tone may also be regulated by NO transported&#xD;
      from the lungs by hemoglobin as a consequence of enhanced binding of NO to reactive thiols of&#xD;
      oxygenated hemoglobin. This study is designed to determine the contribution of&#xD;
      hemoglobin-transported NO to forearm microvascular dilator tone in healthy subjects at rest&#xD;
      and during regional hypoxia associated with forearm exercise stress, with measurements made&#xD;
      before and after regional blockade of endothelial NO synthesis. Findings in this study may be&#xD;
      relevant to understanding the physiological contribution and therapeutic potential of&#xD;
      hemoglobin-transported NO in the regulation of vasodilator tone in diseases and conditions&#xD;
      associated with regional endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelial NO bioactivity&#xD;
      (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, and estrogen&#xD;
      deficiency).&#xD;

        No subjects with a history or evidence of present or past hypertension (blood pressure&#xD;
        greater than 145/95 mmHg), hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dL),&#xD;
        diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose greater than 120 mg/dL), smoking within 2 years,&#xD;

        predisposing to vasculitis or Raynaud's phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No volunteer subject will be allowed to take any medication (oral contraceptive agents are&#xD;
        allowed) or vitamin supplements for at least one month prior to study and will not be&#xD;
        allowed to take aspirin for one week prior to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
