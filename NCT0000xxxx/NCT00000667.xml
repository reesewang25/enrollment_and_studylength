  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of intradermal gp160 in HIV seropositive individuals who are&#xD;
      asymptomatic and have a relatively intact immune system. To determine whether there is&#xD;
      evidence of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response (a &quot;positive&quot; skin test) in these&#xD;
      patients, and also the dose of gp160 that elicits a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)&#xD;
      response. Early immunity to HIV may play an important role in the long interval between virus&#xD;
      infection and the onset of clinical disease. Immune responses have been demonstrated in&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals within weeks to months of infection. Although none of these&#xD;
      responses has been shown to be protective, it is possible that boosting anti-HIV immune&#xD;
      responses through immunization may slow the progression of HIV infection. DTH responses to&#xD;
      HIV-derived recombinant envelope glycoprotein could provide a means of measuring an important&#xD;
      immune function in infected patients, and serve as an easily measured surrogate marker of&#xD;
      cellular immunity. In addition to eliciting local, cutaneous DTH responses, intradermal&#xD;
      inoculation of skin test antigens may be immunogenic, resulting in new antibody production&#xD;
      and cellular immune responses. This study allows direct comparison of gp160 administered&#xD;
      intradermally with alum-adjuvanted intramuscular preparation with respect to immunogenicity&#xD;
      in HIV seropositive patients.&#xD;

      Early immunity to HIV may play an important role in the long interval between virus infection&#xD;
      and the onset of clinical disease. Immune responses have been demonstrated in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals within weeks to months of infection. Although none of these responses has been&#xD;
      shown to be protective, it is possible that boosting anti-HIV immune responses through&#xD;
      immunization may slow the progression of HIV infection. DTH responses to HIV-derived&#xD;
      recombinant envelope glycoprotein could provide a means of measuring an important immune&#xD;
      function in infected patients, and serve as an easily measured surrogate marker of cellular&#xD;
      immunity. In addition to eliciting local, cutaneous DTH responses, intradermal inoculation of&#xD;
      skin test antigens may be immunogenic, resulting in new antibody production and cellular&#xD;
      immune responses. This study allows direct comparison of gp160 administered intradermally&#xD;
      with alum-adjuvanted intramuscular preparation with respect to immunogenicity in HIV&#xD;
      seropositive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of 10 volunteers is initially injected with the lowest dose of intradermal antigen and&#xD;
      the injection site observed at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Clinical and laboratory evaluations are&#xD;
      performed 4 and 8 weeks after inoculation. If there is not delayed-type hypersensitivity&#xD;
      (DTH) response to the lowest dose, patients are retested at the next dose 8 weeks later and&#xD;
      dose escalation is continued at 8-week intervals until (1) there is a DTH response to gp160;&#xD;
      or (2) the maximum anticipated dose is reached. In any individual, a higher dosage is&#xD;
      administered only if there is no evidence of DTH response. Patients with a DTH may continue&#xD;
      to receive booster injections of gp160 at 3 month intervals up to week 70. Patients with an&#xD;
      immune response but no DTH may continue to receive injections for an additional year. A&#xD;
      second group of 10 asymptomatic individuals are recruited and inoculated with the dose found&#xD;
      to bring about either a DTH or lymphocyte proliferative response in 7 of the 10 patients in&#xD;
      the first group. If the second group confirms the results of the initial group, the study is&#xD;
      amended to include patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS.&#xD;
