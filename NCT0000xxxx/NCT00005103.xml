      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of standard treatments on various predisposing factors in&#xD;
      patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Investigate alcohol history, smoking, liver dysfunction and its etiology, estrogen use,&#xD;
      and family history of PCT in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study the relationships of excess iron and the hemochromatosis gene to PCT, including&#xD;
      clinical features and risk of recurrence in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess hepatitis C virus infections in these patients. V. Assess vitamin C levels in&#xD;
      these patients before and after treatment. VI. Assess dietary habits in these patients. VII.&#xD;
      Assess activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) in vivo in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Study polymorphic genes for enzymes that metabolize foreign chemicals, including CYP&#xD;
      enzymes and glutathione transferases in these patients.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo a complete medical evaluation and documentation of&#xD;
      porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) including history, physical examination, standard clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests and porphyrin studies. Alcohol history, smoking, liver dysfunction and its&#xD;
      etiology, estrogen use, and family history of PCT are investigated and recorded. Patients&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire to assess intake of vitamin C and other nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron status is assessed by serum ferritin, Fe and Fe binding capacity, and by the number of&#xD;
      phlebotomies needed to reduce ferritin to the target level. A blood sample is tested for the&#xD;
      hemochromatosis (HC) gene to determine whether each patient has 0, 1, or 2 copies of the HC&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and HCV RNA are measured. Standard liver function&#xD;
      tests and liver biopsy are done if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fasting blood level of ascorbic acid is obtained. Blood clearance of caffeine and&#xD;
      antipyrine, and urinary excretion of caffeine and chlorzoxazone metabolites are determined by&#xD;
      breath tests or measurements in blood or saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping for polymorphic genes for enzymes that metabolize foreign chemicals, including&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) and glutathione transferases are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the above studies, patients undergo individualized standard treatment&#xD;
      either by serial phlebotomies or low dose chloroquine. Patients with HCV are also treated&#xD;
      with interferon alfa-2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed after treatment, at which time initial studies are repeated.&#xD;
