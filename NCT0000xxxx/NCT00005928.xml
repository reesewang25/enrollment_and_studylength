    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (trade&#xD;
      name Ramipril) therapy on inflammation and stiffness of artery walls. These are two risk&#xD;
      factors for developing atherosclerosis-deposits of fatty substances called plaques that can&#xD;
      block the blood vessel, causing a heart attack or stroke. Studies of patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease suggest that ACE inhibitor therapy reduces the risk of heart attack and heart&#xD;
      failure. This study will examine the effects of this treatment on the artery walls and on&#xD;
      levels of substances in the blood that indicate blood vessel inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 40 and 75 years old with coronary artery disease caused by atherosclerosis&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) examination, electrocardiogram and blood tests. Those&#xD;
      enrolled will be randomly assigned to take either an ACE inhibitor pill or a placebo&#xD;
      (look-alike pill with no medicine) once a day for 3 months. No pills will be taken for the&#xD;
      next month, and then participants will take the alternate pill for the next 3 months. That&#xD;
      is, those who took ACE inhibitor for the first 3-month period will take placebo for the&#xD;
      second 3-month period and vice versa. Blood pressures will be taken at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center or by the patient's physician at the end of the first and second weeks of the study.&#xD;
      At the end of 3 weeks, patients will return to the Clinical Center for a blood draw of 6 cc&#xD;
      (1/2 teaspoon) to assess kidney function. In addition, at the end of each 3-month study&#xD;
      period, patients will undergo the following procedures at the Clinical Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fasting blood draw of 60 cc (2 ounces) to measure electrolytes (e.g., sodium and&#xD;
           potassium) and blood markers for inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasound (use of sound waves to create pictures) study of the carotid arteries&#xD;
           (arteries in the neck leading to the brain)-An ultrasound probe is applied gently on the&#xD;
           neck, and ultrasound pictures of the right and left carotid arteries are recorded on&#xD;
           tape. Heart activity and blood pressure are monitored during the procedure with an&#xD;
           electrocardiogram and blood pressure cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the carotid arteries-The patient lies on a table in&#xD;
           a narrow cylinder (the MRI machine) containing a magnetic field. A flexible padded&#xD;
           sensor called a MRI coil is placed over the neck area. Earplugs are placed in the ear to&#xD;
           muffle the loud thumping sounds the machine makes when the magnetic fields are switched.&#xD;
           During the second half of the exam, a contrast agent (gadolinium) is injected through an&#xD;
           intravenous catheter (flexible tube placed in a vein) to brighten the images. The heart&#xD;
           is monitored during the procedure with an electrocardiogram.&#xD;

      Vascular inflammation plays a major role in the progression and clinical expression of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and may contribute to stiffening of arteries that increases the risk of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and stroke. Therapies that reduce vascular inflammation may reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy reduces&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), potentially by reducing&#xD;
      vascular oxidant stress and activation of genes that encode protein mediators of&#xD;
      inflammation. However, we found that ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with CAD had no&#xD;
      overall significant effect on serum levels of cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and&#xD;
      E-selectin (surrogate markers of vascular inflammation), although some patients showed a&#xD;
      reduction in levels, suggesting either that these surrogate markers of vascular inflammation&#xD;
      may not accurately reflect reduction in vascular inflammation, or that only a subset of&#xD;
      patients have biological responses that might reduce their cardiovascular risk. The purposes&#xD;
      of this protocol are to determine 1) the effect of ACE inhibitor therapy on vascular&#xD;
      inflammation in patients with coronary artery disease as assessed by MRI of the carotid&#xD;
      arteries, and 2) whether serum markers of inflammation correlate with reduced vascular&#xD;
      inflammation and thus may be suitable surrogates for determining success of ACE inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
