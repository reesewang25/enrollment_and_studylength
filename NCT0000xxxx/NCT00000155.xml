  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the clinical course of keratoconus and to describe the relationships among its&#xD;
      visual and physiological manifestations, including high- and low-contrast visual acuity,&#xD;
      corneal curvature, slit lamp biomicroscopic findings, corneal scarring, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify risk factors and protective factors that influence the severity and progression&#xD;
      of keratoconus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a bilateral, asymmetric, chronic, progressive ectasia of the cornea&#xD;
      characterized by steepening and distortion of the cornea, thinning of the apical cornea,&#xD;
      corneal scarring, and treatment-related sequelae, such as abrasions from contact lenses and&#xD;
      surgical complications. Patients experience distorted vision that worsens with disease&#xD;
      progression. Their vision is typically corrected with spectacles early in the disease and,&#xD;
      later, with rigid contact lenses. Some patients eventually undergo corneal transplantation in&#xD;
      one or both eyes. Keratoconus affects people in their prime earning years and profoundly&#xD;
      affects their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous large-scale studies of keratoconus have focused on incidence and prevalence,&#xD;
      etiologies, or the clinical management of keratoconus. Few have characterized the course of&#xD;
      the disease and risk factors for its progression in large samples of keratoconus patients.&#xD;
      The incidence of vision-threatening corneal scarring in keratoconus is unknown. Patient's&#xD;
      most frequent questions--how rapidly their keratoconus will progress, how bad their vision&#xD;
      will become, whether they will need corneal surgery, how successful their contact lenses will&#xD;
      be--cannot be answered on the basis of the current body of knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for a prospective, observational study of keratoconus patients is great. Results&#xD;
      from this study will address keratoconus patient's unanswered questions and will enable eye&#xD;
      care practitioners to manage this complex ocular disease better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK) Study is a multicenter,&#xD;
      observational study of 1,209 keratoconus patients followed for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are examined annually. Study measures include visual acuity, patient-reported&#xD;
      quality of life, manifest refraction, keratometry, photodocumentation of the cornea to&#xD;
      identify central corneal scarring, photodocumentation of the flattest contact lens that just&#xD;
      clears the cornea, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and corneal topography. In rigid contact lens&#xD;
      wearers, the fluorescein pattern of the patient's habitual contact lenses is photodocumented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are examined at 15 clinical centers. The clinical centers enrolled 1,209 patients in&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients with keratoconus were eligible if they were at least 12 years old; had an&#xD;
        irregular cornea as determined by keratometry, retinoscopy, or direct ophthalmoscopy in at&#xD;
        least one eye; had Vogt's striae, Fleischer's ring, or corneal scarring characteristic of&#xD;
        keratoconus in at least one eye; and planned to stay in the area for at least 3 years. They&#xD;
        were ineligible if they had bilateral corneal transplants or bilateral nonkeratoconic eye&#xD;
        disease (cataract, intraocular lenses, macular disease, or optic nerve disease other than&#xD;
        glaucoma).&#xD;
