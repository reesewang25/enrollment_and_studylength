  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prevent individuals who have had a massive accidental exposure to HIV from becoming&#xD;
      infected with HIV and possibly developing AIDS, by treating them with zidovudine (AZT).&#xD;
      Although the number of persons who have been (or will be) exposed to a high concentration of&#xD;
      HIV is quite small, these persons have a high risk of becoming infected and treatments are&#xD;
      needed to prevent infection after such an exposure. In animal studies, AZT has prevented the&#xD;
      development of infections after exposure of the animals to a retrovirus (the HIV is a&#xD;
      retrovirus). In patients with AIDS, AZT has been effective in delaying the progression of the&#xD;
      disease. For these reasons a trial of AZT is indicated.&#xD;

      HIV is quite small, these persons have a high risk of becoming infected and treatments are&#xD;
      needed to prevent infection after such an exposure. In animal studies, AZT has prevented the&#xD;

      disease. For these reasons a trial of AZT is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons accepted into the study will take AZT capsules every 4 hours (6 times daily) for 42&#xD;
      days. Treatment with AZT should start as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days, after&#xD;
      exposure to the HIV. Blood and urine samples for various studies will be taken at intervals&#xD;
      during the 42-day treatment period, and blood samples will be taken every 3 months for 1 year&#xD;
      and every 6 months for 2 years and tested for signs of HIV infection (HIV antibody&#xD;
      determinations).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant must be HIV-negative at entry and source must be HIV-positive. The source&#xD;
        should be documented to be infected with HIV by one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of AIDS or ARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive test for HIV antibody (both ELISA and Western blot) or presence of HIV p24&#xD;
             antigen in serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant may be enrolled if the source of exposure is suspected of being infected&#xD;
             with HIV (member of risk group, some type of symptom of HIV infection), but the source&#xD;
             must be confirmed to be infected with HIV for the participant to remain in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant exposure within 5 days prior to beginning therapy, defined as one of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Research laboratory workers or auxiliary personnel who, during the course of their&#xD;
             work, were exposed to high titers of virus on abraded skin or mucous membranes or were&#xD;
             accidentally inoculated with high titers of cell-associated or free virus through an&#xD;
             exposed wound or puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ transplant recipients from HIV-positive donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recipients of blood or blood products from HIV-positive donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who have been artificially inseminated with semen from HIV-positive donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other sources of exposure considered appropriate by the principal investigator and the&#xD;
             sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with poor health (such as renal, hepatic, or bone marrow insufficiency) will&#xD;
             be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded within 4 weeks of study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any potentially myelosuppressive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nephrotoxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded within 1 month of study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood transfusion with evidence of compromised blood marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a malignancy other than cutaneous basal cell or cervical carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant, chronic underlying medical illness which, in the physician's judgment,&#xD;
             would impair study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver dysfunction with bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN, alkaline phosphatase &gt; 5 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal, or SGPT &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Compromised bone marrow function with hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dl or blood transfusion within&#xD;
             the last month, granulocytes &lt; 1500 cells/mm3, or platelets &lt; 100000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        When possible, no other concomitant medication will be administered during the treatment&#xD;
        period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior diagnosis of HIV infection by one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV antibody positive by ELISA or Western blot assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV p24 antigen positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
