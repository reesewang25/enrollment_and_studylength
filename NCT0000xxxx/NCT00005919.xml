  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how pigment is released from the iris (the colored part&#xD;
      of the eye) in patients with pigment dispersion syndrome. It will do this by examining the&#xD;
      response of the pupil (the central opening of the iris) to a flash of light to determine what&#xD;
      is happening in the iris to cause release of the pigment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pigment dispersion syndrome, pigment released from the iris is deposited in other parts of&#xD;
      the eye, including the trabecular meshwork-a filter-like tissue in the front of the eye.&#xD;
      Aqueous fluid (fluid continuously produced by the eye) normally flows out of the eye through&#xD;
      the trabecular meshwork. In some patients, the pigment deposits may block tiny holes in the&#xD;
      meshwork, preventing the fluid from flowing out. This can cause an increase in eye pressure&#xD;
      that may lead to glaucoma and some loss of vision. Understanding how pigment is released from&#xD;
      the iris may help predict the course of pigment dispersion syndrome and identify which&#xD;
      patients will likely develop increased eye pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pigment dispersion syndrome and normal volunteers may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. All participants will have the following procedures, which will be completed in two&#xD;
      clinic visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examination of the front of the eyes, including the cornea, iris and lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vision testing and measurements of visual field and eye pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examination of the trabecular meshwork. For this test, a contact lens is placed on the&#xD;
           eye after the eye has been numbed with anesthetic drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Refraction (dilation of the pupils with drops) and examination of the back of the eyes,&#xD;
           including the optic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reaction of the pupils to low-level infrared light (pupillography). During this&#xD;
           15-minute test, the patient or volunteer wears a lightweight headband with two small&#xD;
           cameras mounted on it. The cameras-one which views the eye and the other the subject's&#xD;
           field of view-record pupil dilation and position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test results in patients with pigment dispersion syndrome will be compared with those in&#xD;
      normal volunteers. Patients will be followed every 6 months (or more often, if medically&#xD;
      indicated) during the 3-year study to determine changes in eye pressure or visual field.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked to return about once a year for 3 years for repeat pupillography.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation and&#xD;
      comparison of two types of patients and to compare them to normal controls. The two types of&#xD;
      patients are those with pigment dispersion (PDS) with normal intraocular pressure (IOP) and&#xD;
      those with PDS and elevated IOP. The hypothesis to be tested is that a developmental&#xD;
      abnormality of the iris pigment epithelium (IPE) and the dilator muscle is the fundamental&#xD;
      defect responsible for the pigment dispersion. This defect may involve other structures of&#xD;
      the eye such as the ciliary and retinal pigment epithelium. The results of pupillography in&#xD;
      PDS with or without elevated IOP and asymmetric PDS (one eye versus fellow eye) will be the&#xD;
      outcome parameters.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients entering the study must have black pigment deposition on the trabecular&#xD;
        meshwork at the site of Schlemm's canal equal to or greater than 2-plus on the&#xD;
        goniophotographic scale of 1 to 5 plus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Although this condition is rare amongst African-Americans, every effort will be made to&#xD;
        recruit such individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with exfoliation syndrome, uveitis, trauma, pigment dispersion with posterior&#xD;
        chamber intra-ocular lens, pigmented tumors, primary open-angle glaucoma, other conditions&#xD;
        with associated pigment dispersion such as acute angle-closure glaucoma, ocular hemorrhage,&#xD;
        Horner's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, normal volunteers will be recruited as controls. They will be free of any eye&#xD;
        disease and be matched for age, sex and degree of myopia.&#xD;
