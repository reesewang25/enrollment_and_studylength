  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression represents a major public health problem worldwide and in the U.S. Fifteen&#xD;
      percent of the U.S. population has depression at some point in life (40 million individuals).&#xD;
      The condition is more common in women, occurring at a female to male ratio of 5:2. Presently,&#xD;
      6-8% of all outpatients in primary care meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression.&#xD;
      Fifteen percent of untreated patients with depression will commit suicide. Most of the people&#xD;
      committing suicide are depressed. Researchers believe that by the year 2020 suicide will be&#xD;
      the 10th most common cause of death in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to mortality due to suicide, depression is also associated with other severe&#xD;
      health conditions. Areas of the brain (hippocampus) begin to deteriorate, heart disease, and&#xD;
      decreased bone mineral density (osteoporosis) are all associated with major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have believed for years that hormones controlled by the hypothalmus, pituitary&#xD;
      gland, and adrenal gland (commonly referred to as the HPA axis or system) are in some way&#xD;
      associated with psychiatric illnesses like depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous studies, researchers have theorized that increased activity of the HPA&#xD;
      axis is associated with depressed patients with typical melancholic features. Melancholia&#xD;
      refers to the feelings of anhedonia (absence of pleasure from activites that would normally&#xD;
      be thought of as pleasurable), insomnia (inability to sleep), guilt, and psychomotor changes.&#xD;
      On the other hand a decrease in activity of the HPA axis may be associated with the atypical&#xD;
      features of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has already developed and refined studies that have improved the understanding of&#xD;
      the HPA axis in healthy humans and depressed patients. Researchers have already identified&#xD;
      and plan to continue identifying distinct subtypes of depressive disorders based on the&#xD;
      activity of the HPA axis.&#xD;

      Major depression represents a major public health problem worldwide and in the U.S. Fifteen&#xD;
      percent of the U.S. population has depression at some point in life (40 million individuals),&#xD;
      with a female to male ratio 5:2. Presently, 6-8% of all outpatients in primary care meet&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for major depression. Fifteen percent of untreated depressed patients&#xD;
      commit suicide-most suicides have depression. In the U.S., in the year 2020 suicide will be&#xD;
      the 10th cause of death. In addition to mortality due to suicide, major depression is&#xD;
      associated with severe morbidity, that includes decreased hippocampal volume, cardiovascular&#xD;
      illness, and decreased bone mineral density. Moreover, after myocardial infarction, patients&#xD;
      with depression have a higher mortality rate than those without depression (adjusted risk&#xD;
      ratio 4:29). Because such morbidity can be differentially affected either by increased or&#xD;
      decreased levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function, it is necessary to study&#xD;
      HPA function in our populations. Additionally, based on our previous data, we have&#xD;
      hypothesized that depressed patients with melancholic features would have increase HPA&#xD;
      function, while those with atypical features would have decreased HPA function. Using this&#xD;
      protocol, over the past four years we have developed, refined, and repeatedly conducted&#xD;
      detailed patient-oriented studies that have expanded the frontiers of existing knowledge on&#xD;
      HPA regulation in healthy humans and depressed subjects. This protocol has already&#xD;
      demonstrated the existence of two distinct biological subtypes of major depression, with the&#xD;
      important finding of a decrement of HPA function in patients with atypical features. Thus,&#xD;
      the atypical classification is not restricted to phenotype but represents a subtype with&#xD;
      specific biological characteristics. This finding shows that there are unique strategies,&#xD;
      targets, and potential interventional approaches to patients with either atypical or&#xD;
      melancholic features. The elucidation of the neuroendocrinology of major depression has been&#xD;
      a key goal of our branch, and this protocol offers the potential to unravel the biology of&#xD;
      phenotypically distinct subtypes of major depression. Moreover, the elucidation of the&#xD;
      medical consequences of major depression requires the precise longitudinal characterization&#xD;
      of HPA function that is accomplished by this study.&#xD;
