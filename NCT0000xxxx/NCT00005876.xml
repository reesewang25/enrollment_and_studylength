      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients&#xD;
      who have locally advanced or metastatic stomach cancer that cannot be removed during surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate, progression-free survival, overall&#xD;
      survival, and time to treatment failure in patients with unresectable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction treated with oral&#xD;
      nitrocamptothecin. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (yes vs no). Patients receive&#xD;
      oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every week for 8 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease&#xD;
      after week 8 may receive additional courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months&#xD;
      until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-55 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
