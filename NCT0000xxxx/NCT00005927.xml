    <textblock>
      The adrenal glands, located atop the kidneys, normally produce several types of hormones.&#xD;
      Tumors of these glands may or may not secrete hormones. It is not known what causes these&#xD;
      tumors or why some secrete hormones and others do not. Some of the tumors are benign and&#xD;
      confined to the adrenal gland, and others are malignant (cancerous), and can spread to other&#xD;
      parts of the body. This study will investigate how adrenal gland tumors develop, why some&#xD;
      secrete steroid hormones and others do not, and why some are benign and others malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 3 and 70 years old with a known or suspected adrenal gland tumor may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants will be hospitalized for 7 to 10 days for various tests&#xD;
      and procedures that may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history and physical examination, including body measurements, as appropriate.&#xD;
           Children and adolescents will have Tanner staging, including examination of the&#xD;
           genitals, to determine the extent of sexual maturity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 24-hour urine collection to measure hormones in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, computed&#xD;
           tomography (CT) and other X-ray studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood tests to see if the tumor secretes hormones in response to specific stimuli,&#xD;
           including exercise, food, and various hormones. The hormones are given through an&#xD;
           intravenous catheter, or IV a thin plastic tube inserted into an arm vein. After the&#xD;
           stimulus, blood is drawn through the same IV every 30 minutes for up to 3 hours to&#xD;
           measure hormone levels. Based on the results of these tests, some patients may have&#xD;
           additional blood tests to check hormone response to special foods, an IV salt solution,&#xD;
           or other hormones or drugs given either IV or by mouth (in pill form).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Photographs to document the effects on the body of abnormal hormone secretion from the&#xD;
           adrenal tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Small samples of blood and tumor tissue for research and DNA (genetic) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A discussion of treatment options will be based on the results of tests. If surgery to remove&#xD;
      the tumor is recommended, the procedure can be done at NIH under this study protocol. If a&#xD;
      malignant tumor is found that cannot be treated surgically, chemotherapy or radiation therapy&#xD;
      may be recommended. These options are not offered under this protocol, but may be available&#xD;
      under a different NIH study (for example, at the National Cancer Institute). Referrals will&#xD;
      be made at the patient s request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had surgery may be followed at the NIH outpatient clinic for 1 year after&#xD;
      surgery. Patients with certain types of tumors may continue to be followed at NIH once a year&#xD;
      for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A registry of study participants will be created to keep records and correlate medical&#xD;
      histories with tissues kept at NIH. The registry will also be used to inform participants of&#xD;
      research studies they may be interested in. No individuals or organizations outside of NIH&#xD;
      will have access to the registry.&#xD;

      The adrenal glands are the major source in the body of the steroid hormones. In normal&#xD;
      physiology, the pituitary hormone ACTH regulates the secretion of glucocorticoids, while the&#xD;
      secretion of mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone is controlled by the renin-angiotensin&#xD;
      system. In addition to these two classes of steroids, the adrenal gland secretes lesser&#xD;
      amounts of intermediate metabolites as well as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated&#xD;
      product (DHEAS) and androstenedione, testosterone, estrogen, and estrone. Dysregulated&#xD;
      secretion of any of these hormones can be caused by sporadic adrenocortical adenomas or&#xD;
      carcinomas, with the development of specific clinical syndromes depending on the identity of&#xD;
      the hormones secreted. In at least a subset of cortisol-producing adrenocortical neoplasms,&#xD;
      the presence of ectopic or abnormal receptors has been described, resulting in the regulation&#xD;
      of cortisol and/or aldosterone by non-physiologic stimuli. The present study will serve as a&#xD;
      mechanism to investigate individuals with steroid hormone-secreting adrenocortical tumors of&#xD;
      all types for the purpose of identifying hereditary, congenital, or acquired defects leading&#xD;
      not only to hormone oversecretion, but also to tumor formation. One of the first goals of the&#xD;
      study was (until very recently) to examine the prevalence of ectopic receptor expression in&#xD;
      cortisol- and/or aldosterone- hormone secreting adrenocortical tumors. This led to the&#xD;
      understanding of the ontogeny of these tumors and the development of novel therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies (e.g., receptor antagonists) to control hormone oversecretion. We currently use&#xD;
      this information for the evaluation and treatment of our patients. An important research goal&#xD;
      of the study is to identify novel genetic defects leading to tumors of the adrenal gland.&#xD;
      This is done through a set of methods, from sequencing of the collected DNA to analysis of&#xD;
      the expression of large sets of genes using gene array/gene chip analysis. This information&#xD;
      may help to identify patients who would benefit from more aggressive intervention strategies,&#xD;
      especially those with potentially malignant tumors. This study also provides the patient&#xD;
      cohort necessary for the establishment of a bank of tissues of varying tumors of the adrenal&#xD;
      cortex, which may serve in the future as an experimental resource to test new diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic methods. Finally, an important and more recent goal of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of excess aldosterone on renal, cardiac, metabolic, and bone systems&#xD;
      in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism, an important subgroup of patients with&#xD;
      adrenocortical tumors. Patients with hyperaldosetronism have not been studied with the same&#xD;
      rigor as patients with hypercortisolism in the past; this study aims at investigating the&#xD;
      relative contribution of hyperaldosteronism in the etiopathogenesis of a number of clinical&#xD;
      problems in patients with adrenocortical lesions and hypertension.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are adults or children with evidence for the existence of a tumor of the adrenal&#xD;
        glands, as indicated by previously obtained imaging studies and/or biochemical&#xD;
        investigation of hormonal secretion. This condition is meant to include the possibility of&#xD;
        individuals with &quot;sub-clinical&quot; hormone secretion syndromes, which may be detectable at the&#xD;
        biochemical level even in the absence of frank clinical signs/symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All eligible patients are invited to participate in this protocol, regardless of sex, race&#xD;
        or ethnic origin. All populations appear at risk for adrenal tumors, and therefore the&#xD;
        subject population can include Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Caucasian,&#xD;
        Hispanic, and Black individuals. Patients will be accepted for evaluation based on referral&#xD;
        from clinicians, or may be self-referred, if they can provide evidence supportive of the&#xD;
        diagnosis of hormone over-secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to return to the NIH for follow-up evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Children less than 3 years old will be excluded from the protocol because of the&#xD;
             limited resources available at the NIH for the care of infants of this age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals over the age of 70 years of age will be excluded because of the&#xD;
             possibility of comorbidities that may significantly affect appropriate initial work-up&#xD;
             and post-operative management. In addition, research data may be compromised by the&#xD;
             inability to interpret data collected from patients over the age of 70 years that may&#xD;
             be on multiple medications for a variety for reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women who are pregnant or nursing will be excluded from the hyperaldosteronism arm of&#xD;
             the protocol. Women with adrenal tumors secreting cortisol or other adrenal hormones&#xD;
             may benefit clinically from evaluation and treatment of their tumor, and will be&#xD;
             considered for enrollment when clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals whose medical status will not allow them, for safety reasons, to&#xD;
             participate in the provocative testing or who have unacceptably high risk for surgical&#xD;
             morbidity and mortality will be excluded from the protocol, as they will not be able&#xD;
             to participate profitably in the research aspects of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Individuals found to have an known inherited syndrome as the cause for hormone&#xD;
             oversecretion will be excluded from participation in this protocol, as the mechanisms&#xD;
             of hormone oversecretion and tumorigenesis is likely to be distinct in these&#xD;
             individuals. Specific examples of syndromes to may be excluded from this protocol&#xD;
             include individuals with Carney Complex, McCune-Albright syndrome, and MEN-1. If&#xD;
             inquiries are received from such patients, they will be referred to the appropriate&#xD;
             ongoing protocols, if possible.&#xD;
