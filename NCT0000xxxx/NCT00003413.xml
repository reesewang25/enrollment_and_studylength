      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug with peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus&#xD;
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian&#xD;
      epithelial cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the complete response rates, event free survival, and overall&#xD;
      survival of patients with recently diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer&#xD;
      receiving carmustine plus melphalan followed by consolidation therapy after having undergone&#xD;
      surgical debulking. II. Evaluate the therapy related mortality associated with the&#xD;
      autotransplant and the consolidation therapy in these patients. III. Evaluate the quality of&#xD;
      life in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by stage (III vs IV) and volume of residual disease (less&#xD;
      than 3 cm vs at least 3 cm). Approximately 10-15 days after surgery, patients receive&#xD;
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily until all peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)&#xD;
      collections have been completed. Patients then receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2&#xD;
      and melphalan IV over 20 minutes on day -1. Peripheral blood stem cells are infused 24 hours&#xD;
      after melphalan on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and&#xD;
      continuing until granulocytes have recovered. Three months after the PBSC infusion, patients&#xD;
      receive consolidation therapy with paclitaxel IV over 6 hours on day 2 and cisplatin IV over&#xD;
      24 hours on day 3. Consolidation treatment is repeated every 3 months for a total of 4&#xD;
      courses. Quality of life questionnaires are completed prior to PBSC transplant, before&#xD;
      discharge after transplant, before each consolidation treatment, and 3 months after the last&#xD;
      consolidation course. Patients are followed at least every 3 months for the first 2 years,&#xD;
      and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An estimated 32 patients will be accrued into this study over 3-4 years.&#xD;
