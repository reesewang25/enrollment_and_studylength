      To elucidate the role of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in the development of chronic liver&#xD;
      disease in patients with hemophilia.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with classical hemophilia (hemophilia A) and Christmas disease (hemophilia B) were&#xD;
      exposed to many hepatotropic viruses during the course of their therapy. Severe chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis among these patients was most likely related to persistent infection with non-A,&#xD;
      non-B hepatitis virus, hepatitis B virus, or delta hepatitis virus, a defective RNA virus&#xD;
      which is dependent upon coinfection with HBV for essential helper functions. Carriers of HBV&#xD;
      could contract an acute delta hepatitis infection that was invariably more severe than the&#xD;
      illness caused by HBV alone. The morbidity and mortality of delta hepatitis infection was&#xD;
      remarkably high. Transmission of the delta hepatitis agent appeared to follow the same routes&#xD;
      of transmission as HBV. Direct parenteral inoculation was the classic mode of transmission of&#xD;
      HBV which suggested a similar mode of transmission for delta hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1986, hemophiliacs treated with commercial concentrates of coagulation factors prepared&#xD;
      from pools of plasma were at great risk to contract delta hepatitis infection. About 50&#xD;
      percent of these patients had delta hepatitis virus antibodies. Also, studies of small&#xD;
      cohorts indicated that hepatitis delta infection was a major cause of chronic liver disease&#xD;
      and cirrhosis. Therefore, there was a critical need to evaluate the frequency and effect of&#xD;
      hepatitis delta infection in hemophiliacs, comparing those with presumed chronic non-A, non-B&#xD;
      hepatitis, chronic hepatitis B alone, and combined chronic delta and HBV infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project was awarded in response to a Request for Applications issued in 1986 on The&#xD;
      Prevalence and Consequences of Hepatitis Delta Infection in Hemophiliacs. The concept for the&#xD;
      initiative originated in the Blood Resources Working Group of the Blood Diseases and&#xD;
      Resources Advisory Committee and was approved by The National Heart, Lung, and Blood,&#xD;
      Advisory Council in February 1985.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted collaboratively within the seven hemophilia treatment centers which&#xD;
      comprised the Southeastern Hemophilia Group. Upon entry into the study, patient data were&#xD;
      collected on transfusion and factor concentrate therapy, age, race, type of hemophilia, sex,&#xD;
      homosexuality, drug abuse and HTLV-III antibody status. Liver function was assessed&#xD;
      noninvasively. Since available tests for HDV infection had limited sensitively and were not&#xD;
      necessarily specific for HDV persistence, HDV RNA was detected in serum by molecular&#xD;
      hybridization using cloned HDV cDNA and single-stranded RNA probes. Western blot analysis was&#xD;
      used to assess antibody responses to HDV. A multifactorial analysis of clinical and&#xD;
      virological data was conducted at the end of the first year of the study. Patients were&#xD;
      reevaluated clinically and virologically at six month intervals to ascertain risk factors for&#xD;
      acquisition of HBV and HDV infections, and to assess the prevalence and rate of progression&#xD;
      of liver disease in each group. Follow-up of patients who had not been previously transfused,&#xD;
      allowed an assessment of the efficacy of current control measures such as HBV immunization&#xD;
      and use of heat-treated factor concentrates for prevention of viral infections in&#xD;
      hemophiliacs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans for extended follow-up of HDV-infected vs non-infected subjects were confounded by the&#xD;
      unexpected emergence of human immunodeficiency virus infection in the hemophilic subjects who&#xD;
      comprised the study population.&#xD;
