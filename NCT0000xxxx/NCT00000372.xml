  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of D-cycloserine and glycine for treating&#xD;
      negative symptoms (such as loss of interest, loss of energy, loss of warmth, and loss of&#xD;
      humor) which occur between phases of positive symptoms (marked by hallucinations, delusions,&#xD;
      and thought confusions) in schizophrenics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clozapine is currently the most effective treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Two other drugs, D-cycloserine and glycine, are being investigated as new treatments.&#xD;
      D-cycloserine improves negative symptoms when added to some drugs, but may worsen these&#xD;
      symptoms when given with clozapine. Glycine also improves negative symptoms and may still be&#xD;
      able to improve these symptoms when given with clozapine. This study gives either&#xD;
      D-cycloserine or glycine (or an inactive placebo) with clozapine to determine which is the&#xD;
      best combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 will receive D-cycloserine plus&#xD;
      clozapine. Group 2 will receive glycine plus clozapine. Group 3 will receive an inactive&#xD;
      placebo plus clozapine. Patients will receive these medications for 8 weeks. Negative&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia will be monitored through the Scale for the Assessment of Negative&#xD;
      Symptoms, Positive symptoms will be monitored through the Positive and Negative Syndrome&#xD;
      Scale, and additionally subjects will complete the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the&#xD;
      Global Assessment Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual may be eligible for this study if he/she is 18 to 65 years old and has been&#xD;
      diagnosed with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if glycine produces improvement in negative symptoms and D-cycloserine produces&#xD;
      worsening in symptoms compared to placebo, patients will undergo a double blind study of&#xD;
      d-cycloserine and glycine treatment added to clozapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clozapine is more effective for negative symptoms of schizophrenia than conventional&#xD;
      neuroleptics, but the neurochemical actions contributing to this superior clinical efficacy&#xD;
      remain unclear. Recent evidence points to a role for glutamatergic dysregulation in&#xD;
      schizophrenia, as well as important differences between conventional agents and clozapine in&#xD;
      effects upon glutamatergic systems. D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine&#xD;
      modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, improves negative symptoms when&#xD;
      added to conventional agents and worsens negative symptoms when added to clozapine. High-dose&#xD;
      glycine also improves negative symptoms and has provided preliminary evidence suggesting that&#xD;
      glycine improves negative symptoms when added to clozapine. Serum concentrations of glycine&#xD;
      predicted response to both high-dose glycine and D-cycloserine. Both clozapine and&#xD;
      D-cycloserine may improve negative symptoms by activation of the glycine modulatory site of&#xD;
      the NMDA receptor complex. Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist, it may act as an&#xD;
      antagonist at the glycine site in the presence of clozapine, whereas the full agonist,&#xD;
      glycine, would not be expected to worsen negative symptoms in the presence of clozapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to administer a fixed-dose of D-cycloserine, glycine, or placebo added to&#xD;
      clozapine in 45 patients with schizophrenia. Because assessments are standardized between&#xD;
      studies, results from this study can be compared with results from a previous study of&#xD;
      D-cycloserine added to conventional neuroleptic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was ultimately suspended before participants were enrolled, due to definitive&#xD;
      findings indicating that pairing treatment of D-cycloserine with Clozapine resulted in&#xD;
      worsening of negative symptoms.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Pairing D-Cycloserine with Clozapine was found to worsen negative side effects in patients with&#xD;
    Schizophrenia, so the study was suspended.&#xD;
