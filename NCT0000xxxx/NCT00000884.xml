      context of previous immunization via alternate mucosal routes or intramuscularly with a&#xD;

      One of the earliest observations in the HIV epidemic was the demonstration of HIV infection&#xD;
      at mucosal surfaces of cells in the genital tract. These data suggest that priming of immune&#xD;
      defenses of viral infected cells may be an important component in the strategy of developing&#xD;
      an effective HIV vaccine. Direct immunization of relevant mucosal surfaces with a vectored&#xD;
      vaccine may stimulate mucosal immunity. The ALVAC-HIV vCP205 immunogen is constructed from a&#xD;
      live recombinant canarypox vector that has a good safety profile in volunteers and should&#xD;
      allow mucosal induction of immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double-blind trial evaluates the safety of and immune response to&#xD;
      vaccination with ALVAC-HIV vCP205 given at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. Patients are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 7 drug administration routes as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Intramuscular Group B: Oral Group C: Intranasal Group D: Intrarectal Group E:&#xD;
      Intravaginal Group F: Intranasal/intramuscular Group G: Intrarectal/intramuscular Twelve&#xD;
      patients are randomized to each group, 8 of whom receive experimental therapy with ALVAC-HIV&#xD;
      vCP205 and 4 of whom receive control therapy with ALVAC-RG vCP2058 (rabies vaccine). Women&#xD;
      are preferentially enrolled, with a goal of 60% women (minimum of 4 women per treatment arm);&#xD;
      only women are randomized to Group E. Blinding is maintained with respect to drug assignment&#xD;
      rather than route of administration, after randomization. NOTE: The protocol will be amended&#xD;
      to add 2 boost vaccinations with subunit products at approximately Months 9 and 12 when a&#xD;
      suitable boost product is identified. [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/3/98: The protocol has been&#xD;
      modified to include 2 booster vaccinations to be administered at 9 and 12 months. Patients in&#xD;
      Group A receive booster vaccination with ALVAC-HIV VCP205 or ALVAC-RG intranasally. Patients&#xD;
      in Groups B through G are boosted with AIDSVAX B/B vaccine (a bivalent vaccine consisting of&#xD;
      MN rgp120/HIV-1 antigen and GNE8 rgp120/HIV-1 antigen in alum adjuvant) or with Imovax&#xD;
      diploid cell rabies vaccine; vaccinations for these patients are given intramuscularly.] [AS&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 11/19/98: The second booster vaccination for group A will be administered at&#xD;
      study Month 15.]&#xD;
