    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel with that of&#xD;
      doxorubicin in treating patients who have advanced AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective than doxorubicin in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the effect of therapy with paclitaxel to therapy with liposomal doxorubicin on&#xD;
      progression-free survival and on global assessment of quality of life of subjects with&#xD;
      advanced AIDS-related K.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the toxicity profile of intravenous paclitaxel with liposomal doxorubicin in&#xD;
      patients with advanced AIDS-related K.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the overall and complete response rate of intravenous paclitaxel with&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin in patients with advanced AIDS-related K.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect of intravenous paclitaxel as compared with therapy with liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin on the clinical course of HIV infection in patients with advanced AIDS-related&#xD;
      K.S., by monitoring CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte subsets, HIV viral load and the incidence and type&#xD;
      of opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore the relationship between viral load and response to the therapy for patients&#xD;
      with AIDS-related K.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To describe the relationship between &quot;technical&quot; response as measured by the current KS&#xD;
      response criteria and the clinical benefit of therapy as measured by the revised KS clinical&#xD;
      benefit criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to receive either paclitaxel&#xD;
      (arm I) or doxorubicin HCL liposome(arm II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel over 3 hours by intravenous infusion. Treatment course&#xD;
      repeats every 2 weeks. Patients are evaluated every third course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin HCL liposome over 30-60 minutes by intravenous infusion.&#xD;
      Treatment course is repeated every 3 weeks. Patients are evaluated before every odd course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both arms continue treatment if there is no disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients with complete response continue on study treatment for 2 courses beyond&#xD;
      documented complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed before, during, and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for years&#xD;
      2-5, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 240 patients (120 patients in each arm) accrued into this&#xD;
      study over 24 months.&#xD;
