  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molecular approaches to the understanding of human neoplastic disease have revealed that&#xD;
      multiple genetic alterations are an essential component of tumorigenesis. Both germline and&#xD;
      somatic genetic alterations can be involved in the malignant transformation of normal cells.&#xD;
      Identification of the genes involved in neoplastic transformation has been approached through&#xD;
      the molecular analysis of sporadic cancers and the genetic study of families with an&#xD;
      inherited predisposition for cancer. The interplay of these two approaches has led to the&#xD;
      characterization of genes such as the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, the p53 gene and the&#xD;
      adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that are all involved in the development of both&#xD;
      hereditary and non-hereditary forms of cancer. Inherited mutations in such genes predispose&#xD;
      affected families to hereditary cancer syndromes, affording an opportunity to identify&#xD;
      genetic lesions that also cause the more common sporadic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer (PRCA) is the most common cancer diagnosed (1999 estimate 179,300 cases) and&#xD;
      the second leading cause of cancer mortality (1999 estimate 37,000 deaths) in men in the&#xD;
      United States. Family history is the single strongest risk factor currently known for&#xD;
      prostate cancer. This raises the possibility that heritable genetic factors may be involved&#xD;
      in the development of this disease in a subset of men. The genetic contribution to diseases&#xD;
      of complex origin such as cancer is often most salient in families of early onset cases.&#xD;
      Therefore, prostate cancer inheritance following a simple Mendelian pattern may be identified&#xD;
      in the families of probands with early-onset cases. Common susceptibility alleles of small&#xD;
      effect may be detectable in families with later-onsent and/or less strong family history of&#xD;
      PRCA or in case-control data.&#xD;
