  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial, sponsored by Amgen, Inc., which produces the recombinant methionyl human stem&#xD;
      cell factor (r-metHuSCF), also involves two other institutions. The primary objective is&#xD;
      determination of the safety of administering multiple doses of r-metHuSCF in the setting of&#xD;
      acquired aplastic anemia and evaluation of the effect of r-metHuSCF on peripheral blood&#xD;
      counts. Potential effects of r-metHuSCF on frequency of need for red cell or platelet&#xD;
      transfusions and on bone marrow morphology/cellularity will also be evaluated.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Acquired moderate or severe aplastic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intolerant to, or failure to durably respond to, ATG/ALG therapy with or without&#xD;
        cyclosporin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have received ATG/ALG, therapy for 12 weeks prior to enrollment or&#xD;
        cyclosporin for 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Two years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karnofsky Performance Status greater than or equal to 60 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate organ function as defined by serum creatine less than 2.0 mg/dl and a bilirubin&#xD;
        less than 2.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients (or their parent[s]/responsible guardian[s]) must be able to comprehend and be&#xD;
        willing to sign an informed consent prior to starting r-metHuSCF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No current diagnosis or past history of myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No diagnosis of Fanconi's anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, or other congenital forms of&#xD;
        aplastic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No current diagnosis of clinically active paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) defined&#xD;
        as patients with clinically significant thrombosis or hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No treatment with ATG, ALG, or other immunosuppresive agents within 12 weeks of enrollment&#xD;
        or treatment with cyclosporine A or IL-3 within 4 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No treatment with hematopoietic growth factors within 2 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No evidence of active uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No known allergy to Ecoli-derived products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No current or recent symptoms of asthma occurring within the past 10 years (including&#xD;
        allergic asthma, or asthma induced by cold temperature, infection, or exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid-type event manifested by disseminated urticaria,&#xD;
        laryngeal edema, and/or bronchospasm (or for example: food, insect bites, etc). Patients&#xD;
        with drug allergies, manifested solely by rash and/or urticaria, are not excluded. An&#xD;
        isolated episode of urticaria occuring more than 3 years earlier is not a contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No significant nonmalignant disease including previously documented HIV infection,&#xD;
        uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 115 mmHg), unstable&#xD;
        angina, congestive heart failure (greater than NY Class II), poorly controlled diabetes,&#xD;
        coronary angioplasty within 6 months, or uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnancy or breast feeding. Those of childbearing potential must observe adequate birth&#xD;
        control measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No treatment with an investigational agent (other than hematopoietic growth factors) within&#xD;
        4 weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No concurrent use of beta adrenergic blocking agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No concurrent use, or use within the past 2 weeks, of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO&#xD;
        Inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No psychiatric, addictive, or any disorder which compromises ability to give truly informed&#xD;
        consent for participation in this study.&#xD;
