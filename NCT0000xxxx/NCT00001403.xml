      This study will examine rare congenital disorders that involve malformations and abnormal&#xD;
      growth. It will focus on patients with Proteus syndrome, whose physical features are&#xD;
      characterized by overgrowth, benign tumors of fatty tissue or blood vessels, asymmetric arms&#xD;
      or legs, and large feet with very thick soles. The study will explore the genetic and&#xD;
      biochemical cause and course of the disease, the changes in symptoms over time, and the&#xD;
      effects of the disease on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Proteus syndrome and their parents may be eligible for this study. Parents will&#xD;
      be studied, when possible, for comparison of molecular findings. Study candidates will have a&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination, including X-rays and possibly other imaging tests,&#xD;
      such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound. Other&#xD;
      tests and examinations may be done if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those enrolled in the study will have will be interviewed or complete questionnaires, or&#xD;
      both, about how their disease affects them. (Parents will be asked about their feelings about&#xD;
      having a child with a rare disorder.) Patients will provide a small blood sample for research&#xD;
      and may be asked to undergo biopsies from a normal area of skin and from a tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to specifically delineate the phenotype and natural history&#xD;
      and genetic etiology of Proteus syndrome (PS) and other overgrowth disorders hypothesized to&#xD;
      be in the PI3K/AKT pathway. As we have recently determined the molecular cause of PS and the&#xD;
      related disorder of fibroadipose overgrowth, our main objectives moving forward include&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlations, identifying quantifiable phenotypic characteristics in&#xD;
      patients and measuring changes in these characteristics over time, developing potential&#xD;
      biomarkers for future therapeutic research, and using our new molecular insights to expand&#xD;
      our understanding of both PS and related overgrowth disorders. The natural history and&#xD;
      specific phenotypic characteristics of patients with PS and selected other overgrowth&#xD;
      disorders will be determined by clinical assessment and longitudinal follow-up of patients,&#xD;
      which includes patients who have been exposed to therapeutic agents, such as an AKT&#xD;
      inhibitor. Subjects will be screened for eligibility using published diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      PS; screening for AKT1 and other pathway gene mutations may be used in patients with&#xD;
      overlapping phenotypes. The discovery of the AKT1 activating mutation in patients with this&#xD;
      disease provides an attractive target for directed treatment for this devastating disorder.&#xD;
      This protocol aims to aid in identifying individuals with molecularly-confirmed AKT1&#xD;
      mutations who may be candidates for pharmacologic interventional studies. We also propose to&#xD;
      expand our clinical ascertainment to determine the full range of PS/AKT1 activating mutation&#xD;
      phenotypes and to study other overlapping conditions. The etiology of these disorders will be&#xD;
      studied using candidate gene analysis (primarily based on the PI3K/AKT pathway) and possibly&#xD;
      exome and whole genome sequencing, performed as part of protocol 10-HG-0065.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients who meet clinical diagnostic criteria for PS, or who have demonstrated AKT1&#xD;
        p.Glu17Lys mutations are considered eligible for this protocol. As well, we will generally&#xD;
        offer an in-person evaluation at the NIHCC to patients with PS whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As these disorders are usually apparent at or soon after birth, and appear to evolve at&#xD;
        least into the third decade of life, early assessment and long-term follow-up are&#xD;
        necessary. We have already learned that PS has a high pediatric mortality rate. PS and&#xD;
        other overgrowth disorders are progressive and for some individuals, may warrant more&#xD;
        frequent observation during youth and adolescence. Therefore, it would not be practicable&#xD;
        or ethical to exclude children from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with overgrowth that is not definitively PS (i.e., who do not appear to meet&#xD;
        clinical diagnostic criteria) may also be eligible to participate in this study. Decisions&#xD;
        to invite patients in this group to the NIHCC for an in-person evaluation are made on a&#xD;
        case-by-case basis where the patient s phenotype, health, proximity to the NIH, and fit&#xD;
        with our current research aims will all be taken into account. In general, we will consider&#xD;
        subjects who have one or more of the manifestations from the PS clinical criteria as&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enrollment of adults with impaired decision-making capacity is scientifically justified&#xD;
        because PS is an ultra-rare disorder where 10-15% of patients have significant cognitive&#xD;
        impairment and gaining a better understanding of this aspect of the phenotype (as well as&#xD;
        the other concerns adult patients may present with) is critical to advancing our knowledge&#xD;
        of this disorder. Progression of overgrowth, particularly the fibroadipose overgrowth in&#xD;
        CLOVES syndrome, is a significant issue in many adults with this condition and&#xD;
        understanding the trajectory of overgrowth throughout the lifespan is an important goal of&#xD;
        this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This protocol enrolls participants of all ages which includes women of child-bearing age.&#xD;
        We recognize that women may become pregnant during the course of this study. While we have&#xD;
        not documented a case of a female with Proteus syndrome becoming pregnant it is important&#xD;
        to gather clinical data if such a case occurs in order to better understand the natural&#xD;
        history of Proteus syndrome and related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since we enroll people of all ages, some of the women we enroll may become pregnant during&#xD;
        the course of the study. No radiation imaging studies will be done on women if they are&#xD;
        known to be pregnant. We will screen all women of reproductive age with a pregnancy test&#xD;
        prior to surgery, as per standard surgical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no exclusions for race, age, or gender for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with cancer but who do not have overgrowth or other non-tumor manifestations of PS&#xD;
        or non-PS overgrowth, whose tumors may harbor AKT1, PIK3CA, or other mutations, are not&#xD;
        eligible for this study. In general, patients who clearly meet diagnostic criteria for a&#xD;
        well-characterized overgrowth syndrome that is NOT PS are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
        Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and PHACES syndrome are examples of such entities. We&#xD;
        will not enroll prisoners, healthy volunteers, or lab personnel. Some persons with PS and&#xD;
        other overgrowth conditions are intellectually disabled (ID) or developmentally delayed&#xD;
        (probably ~10%). The consent issues are no different for children with ID than&#xD;
        developmentally appropriate children except that assent will be judged by developmental&#xD;
        level instead of age. Patients who are adults and decisionally-impaired are eligible only&#xD;
        if they have a legal guardian who has authority to sign a consent form on their behalf.&#xD;
        Patients who are medically fragile or unable to tolerate travel to the NIHCC will not&#xD;
        routinely be eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will request permission to retain some information about prospective participants who&#xD;
        may not be immediately enrolled. As these participants will not immediately be signing a&#xD;
        consent form and joining the study, we propose to NOT count these participants in our&#xD;
        Inclusion Enrollment Reports until they have formally enrolled in the study (that is, they&#xD;
        have signed consent forms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will not enroll neonates (newborns less than one month old).&#xD;
