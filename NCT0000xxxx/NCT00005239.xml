  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine genetic and environmental influences on several recently identified coronary heart&#xD;
      disease risk factors in identical and fraternal adult women twins. The risk factors included&#xD;
      low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass patterns, plasma apolipoprotein levels, body fat&#xD;
      distribution, and serum insulin levels.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1974, a twin registry was established from members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care&#xD;
      Program's Northern California region. In all, 9,821 twin pairs were enrolled. In 1978-1979,&#xD;
      434 pairs of female twins were recruited from the registry for a clinical examination of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease risk factors. The clinical examination included an extensive health&#xD;
      questionnaire, measurements of plasma lipids and serum chemistries, analyses of genetic&#xD;
      markers for determination of zygosity, measurement of expired air carbon monoxide and serum&#xD;
      thiocyanate levels, and a complete physical examination. During the ten years since the first&#xD;
      examination, several new or more specific coronary heart disease risk factors have been&#xD;
      recognized, including low density lipoprotein and insulin levels, and the anatomic&#xD;
      distribution of body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who participated in the first examination were invited to participate in the second&#xD;
      examination. Medical records and/or death certificates were obtained to document coronary&#xD;
      heart disease events. Questionnaires were used to collect information on health history,&#xD;
      nutrition, and physical activity. A clinical examination assessed blood pressure, a variety&#xD;
      of anthropometric measures and cardiovascular fitness. Blood specimens were collected for&#xD;
      clinical chemistry and lipid/lipoprotein profiles. To assess genetic influence, the&#xD;
      heritability of each of the risk factors was estimated. Blood was frozen for future studies&#xD;
      of polymorphic DNA markers. Using the monozygotic co-twin control method, the effects of&#xD;
      environmental or behavioral factors on these risk factors were assessed after controlling for&#xD;
      genetic factors that could explain their association. Two hypotheses were examined that could&#xD;
      be uniquely addressed using twin data. First, the association of body fat distribution with&#xD;
      other coronary heart disease risk factors was mediated by serum insulin levels. Secondly,&#xD;
      cardiovascular fitness explained in part the association of physical activity with coronary&#xD;
      heart disease risk factors such as HDL-cholesterol and insulin levels. Lipoprotein analyses&#xD;
      were conducted at Donner Laboratory at Berkeley.&#xD;
