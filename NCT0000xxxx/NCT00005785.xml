      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a new stem cell transplant&#xD;
      procedure to treat acute or chronic leukemia, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome,&#xD;
      Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in HIV-infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients usually are not offered bone marrow transplant treatments because they&#xD;
      are at increased risk of dying from the intense chemotherapy and radiation therapy used for&#xD;
      the procedure. This study uses a modified procedure, transplanting stem cells instead of bone&#xD;
      marrow, designed to be less dangerous for such patients. Patients will also undergo a&#xD;
      procedure called gene transfer to try to halt progression of their HIV infection. The&#xD;
      procedure in this study differs from standard bone marrow transplantation in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells will be transplanted instead of bone marrow. (Stem cells, which are produced by&#xD;
      the bone marrow, mature into the different blood components-white and red cells and&#xD;
      platelets.) The stem cell donor will be given a drug that releases these cells from their&#xD;
      bone marrow into the blood stream. The cells will then be collected from the donor by&#xD;
      apheresis, a procedure in which whole blood is drawn, the stem cells separated and removed,&#xD;
      and the rest of the blood returned to the donor.);&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will use lower doses of chemotherapy than the conventional method, and will not&#xD;
      use radiation therapy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
      A laboratory-manufactured gene designed to obstruct HIV reproduction will be inserted into&#xD;
      the stem cells, rendering future cells that develop from resistance to the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective patients will be tested for matching with an HIV-negative donor (family member)&#xD;
      and will undergo a medical history, physical examination and several tests (e.g., breathing&#xD;
      tests, X-rays, etc.) to determine eligibility for the study. Study participants will then&#xD;
      undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells called lymphocytes. Stem cells will be&#xD;
      collected from the donor. Half the donated cells will have the HIV-resistant gene inserted;&#xD;
      the other half will have a &quot;control&quot; gene inserted. Additional stem cells collected a second&#xD;
      day will not be manipulated. All the donor cells will be frozen until transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given drugs (cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and cyclosporin) to prevent the&#xD;
      donated cells from being rejected and to prevent them from damaging the patient's organs. The&#xD;
      thawed stem cells will then be infused through a vein. After 30, 60 and 100 days, bone marrow&#xD;
      cells and circulating lymphocytes will be checked to see how many are of donor cell origin.&#xD;
      If less than 100 percent are of donor origin, more lymphocytes will be transfused. Patients&#xD;
      will have physical examinations and blood tests once or twice a week for 2 to 3 months with&#xD;
      and then will be followed periodically for at least 5 years.&#xD;

      Adult patients with myelodysplasia, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can be cured by&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This curative effect has until now been&#xD;
      ascribed to the intense chemoradiotherapy used to condition the recipient for&#xD;
      transplantation. The assumption that the curative effect of allogeneic transplantation rests&#xD;
      in the ability to deliver very high doses of chemoradiotherapy has led to the restriction of&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation to those recipient patients whose overall status would permit the&#xD;
      use of such intense conditioning. As a result, HIV positivity has generally appeared as an&#xD;
      exclusion criteria to allogeneic transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Additionally,&#xD;
      early studies of allogeneic BMT in HIV patients suggested no benefit in controlling the&#xD;
      progression to AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the existence of donor derived CD4 and CD8&#xD;
      positive lymphocytes with specific reactivity to recipient leukemia providing a potent graft&#xD;
      versus leukemia (GVL) effect, and this GVL effect is area of intense interest both at the NIH&#xD;
      and elsewhere. In fact, early attempts to decrease treatment related mortality in chronic&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients undergoing allogeneic BMT by T-cell depletion of the&#xD;
      graft resulted in an unacceptably high rate of relapse suggesting that alloreactivity in the&#xD;
      donor graft accounted for a significant portion of the cure rate in this disease. This GVL&#xD;
      effect is most dramatically demonstrated among relapsed allogeneic bone marrow transplant&#xD;
      recipients transplanted for CML in whom a simple infusion of donor lymphocytes can induce a&#xD;
      complete and durable remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplants are currently being&#xD;
      investigated for engraftment efficacy and toxicity in a number of transplant centers.&#xD;
      Preliminary data including our own experience with 13 patients undergoing this type of&#xD;
      procedure have shown a high rate of complete donor engraftment, low toxicity, and&#xD;
      preservation of the GVL effect. Two recent published studies investigating non-myeloablative&#xD;
      allo-transplantation in standard risk patients revealed an extremely low rate of transplant&#xD;
      related complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decreased risk of transplant related complications associated with non-myeloablative&#xD;
      transplants expands the eligibility of transplant candidates and may allow successful&#xD;
      application in patients infected with HIV. In this study, we will assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of nonmyeloablative transplantation in patients with HIV infection. Moreover, the&#xD;
      introduction of an HIV resistance vector into a portion of the allogeneic graft provides a&#xD;
      unique opportunity to test the in vivo efficacy of introducing resistance to HIV through the&#xD;
      self renewing stem cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end points of this study are engraftment, degree of donor-host chimerism, incidence of&#xD;
      acute and chronic GVHD, transplant related morbidity and mortality, disease free survival, as&#xD;
      well as overall survival, and overall level and persistence of progeny of gene modified&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
