      To test the effectiveness treating AIDS related depression with imipramine hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression syndromes are commonly associated with chronic, disabling, and fatal diseases. Due&#xD;
      to the relentless course of HIV infection, there is a certain reluctance to treat the&#xD;
      associated depression. In other illness, it has been proven that treating the depression&#xD;
      often results in improvement of overall health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a placebo controlled trial. Half of the patients are given imipramine hydrochloride&#xD;
      every day for 6 weeks. Assessment is done by self reports and the Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale. Prior to entry all patients are given a psychiatric evaluation. There is a cross over&#xD;
      phase in which placebo non responders are entered into an open-label study and given&#xD;
      imipramine hydrochloride.&#xD;
