  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our current clinical trial, we are comparing the effects of two NMDA receptor antagonists&#xD;
      to placebo in patients with painful distal symmetrical diabetic neuropathy or post-herpetic&#xD;
      neuralgia. The treatments in this three-period crossover study are dextromethorphan, up to&#xD;
      920 mg/day (about 8 times the antitussive dose), memantine, 30-50 mg/day, and placebo.&#xD;
      Memantine is an NMDA antagonist used in Europe to treat Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. The underlying hypothesis, based on studies of painful neuropathies in animal&#xD;
      models, is that neuropathic pain is caused largely by sensitization of central nervous system&#xD;
      neurons caused by excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, acting largely through NMDA&#xD;
      receptors. A previous small trial of dextromethorphan suggested efficacy in diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy pain. The study requires one visit to the NIH outpatient Pain Research Clinic, and&#xD;
      consists of three 9-week treatment periods. Patients who respond to one of the medications&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in further controlled studies of the medication followed by up&#xD;
      to several years of open-label treatment under continued observation.&#xD;

        Patients must be over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a definite diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy or post herpetic neuralgia&#xD;
        or a diagnosis of neuropathic pain of various etiologies other than diabetic neuropathy or&#xD;
        post herpetic neuralgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Duration of symptoms must be at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severity of pain must be at least mild, if constant; or at least moderate, if intermittent&#xD;
        and at least 2 hours duration a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients using tricyclics, narcotics, or antiseizure medications, must keep the drug&#xD;
        dosages constant throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with unstable disease process; i.e., angina pectoris, accelerated hypertension,&#xD;
        recent stroke or transient cerebral ischemia, uncontrolled seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnant or lactating women. Women of child bearing potential must use birth control&#xD;
        pills, intrauterine device, or barrier contraceptive devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of significant drug abuse or PCP use. No history of IV drug abuse, prescription&#xD;
        drug abuse, or alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No significant liver or kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No MAO inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No cognitive impairment or language difficulty as judged by difficulty completing pain&#xD;
        diary, medical history, or telephone conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have any other chronic pain condition that gives them pain greater than&#xD;
        the neuropathy pain.&#xD;
