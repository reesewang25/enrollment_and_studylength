  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterococci, especially vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), are increasing in prevalence&#xD;
      in many hospitals in the United States. Patients undergoing liver transplantation are at&#xD;
      particular risk for developing infection due to VRE. The effect of prior colonization with&#xD;
      VRE on the outcome of liver transplantation is unknown. This prospective study will ascertain&#xD;
      the prevalence of gastrointestinal colonization with vancomycin resistant enterococci among&#xD;
      patients awaiting liver transplantation at the University of Michigan Health System. Risk&#xD;
      factors for acquisition of the organism, natural history of colonization and outcome in&#xD;
      colonized patients will also be determined. All patients currently listed on a priority&#xD;
      waiting list for liver transplantation at UMHS will be invited to participate. Patients will&#xD;
      receive a standardized letter from their primary gastroenterologist describing the rationale&#xD;
      for the study. Patients will be contacted by telephone by a member of the study team in order&#xD;
      to arrange an appointment in the GCRC at the time of their regularly scheduled Transplant&#xD;
      Clinic appointment in order discuss their potential participation in the study. Patients who&#xD;
      give informed consent, will be interviewed using a standard interview questionnaire.&#xD;
      Demographic and historical data relevant to the risk of VRE colonization will be collected&#xD;
      during the interview. A sample will be obtained via rectal swab for culture. Rectal swabs for&#xD;
      culture and collection of information on the standardized questionnaire will be repeated&#xD;
      every six months while the patient is awaiting liver transplantation. When a patient&#xD;
      undergoes liver transplantation, a culture will be obtained at the time of admission and&#xD;
      weekly after post-operatively until discharge. All patients will be followed for 60 days&#xD;
      after transplantation to assess several primary outcomes, including operative and&#xD;
      post-operative complications, VRE infection and mortality. Rectal swabs will be the only&#xD;
      procedure performed for the purposes of this study. Culture results will not be made&#xD;
      available to the transplant team in order to avoid bias in clinical care. All data will be&#xD;
      entered into an electronic database. GCRC statisticians will assist in the analysis of risk&#xD;
      factors and outcome analysis.&#xD;
