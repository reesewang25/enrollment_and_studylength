      To modify and expand an existing pharmacokinetic model for nasal dose as well as to develop a&#xD;
      new model to estimate tracheobronchial dose of an active agent for each subject in a study of&#xD;
      acute respiratory health effects.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic analysis of acute, reversible respiratory health effects is uncommonly&#xD;
      performed, yet these are important health outcomes because acute responses by the respiratory&#xD;
      defense system appear to represent one end of the continuum toward progressive, chronic and&#xD;
      potentially disabling physiologic changes. Repeatable epidemiologic studies of dose-response&#xD;
      relationships necessitate accurate measures of 'dose'. However, in occupational and&#xD;
      environmental settings, exposure to a toxin is seldom found at identical concentrations&#xD;
      and/or particle sizes among persons with the same activity patterns. In addition, air&#xD;
      concentration does not account for factors such as clearance or metabolism which may alter&#xD;
      the biologically effective tissue dose. These factors cause the target tissue dose of the&#xD;
      toxin to vary greatly despite exposure to similar air concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of these toxicokinetic models were individual measures of tissue dose used in a&#xD;
      2-stage epidemiologic analysis which placed special emphasis on the definition of individual&#xD;
      dose-response curves for exposure to an irritant dust, sodium borate, and the reversible&#xD;
      effects of peak expiratory flow and irritant symptoms. A primary advantage of the two stage&#xD;
      epidemiologic approach was that it permitted particular attention to be focused on the&#xD;
      factors which determined the sensitivity (threshold) and reactivity (slope) for an&#xD;
      individual. The use of tissue dose estimates were also compared to simple exposure&#xD;
      measurements in the epidemiologic analysis to evaluate the efficacy of using dosimetric&#xD;
      methods in epidemiologic studies.&#xD;
