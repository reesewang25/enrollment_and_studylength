  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of the drug capsaicin in controlling pain after third&#xD;
      molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Capsaicin, the ingredient in chili peppers that makes them&#xD;
      &quot;hot,&quot; belongs to a class of drugs called vanilloids, which have been found to temporarily&#xD;
      inactivate pain-sensing nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 40 years of age who require third molar (wisdom&#xD;
      tooth) extraction may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures in three visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have touch (sensory) testing by the following three methods: 1) a warm sensor&#xD;
      applied to the gums and the patient will rate when they first feel heat and when the heat&#xD;
      feels painful; 2) the bristles of a small paint brush will be gently stroked across the gums,&#xD;
      and the patient will say whether it feels painful; 3) a light touch will be applied to the&#xD;
      gums with a small needle, and the patient will rate the pain intensity following the touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After testing, patients will be numbed with a local anesthetic (bupivacaine) and then&#xD;
      capsaicin or placebo (an inactive solution) will be injected next to the tooth. The tooth&#xD;
      then will be extracted one day later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the clinic after 24 hours to repeat the same type of sensory testing.&#xD;
      After testing, patients will be sedated and numbed with a local anesthetic (lidocaine) and&#xD;
      given an intravenous injection of either saline or ketorolac (30 mg). After the extraction,&#xD;
      pain ratings will be recorded every 20 minutes, for up to 6 hours. During this time, patients&#xD;
      will be monitored for numbness, pain, side effects and vital signs (heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, respiration, etc.). Those who request pain medicine will receive acetaminophen and&#xD;
      codeine. Patients will be required to stay for up to 3 more hours after this and then they&#xD;
      will then be discharged with pain medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the clinic after another 48 hours to repeat the same sensory testing.&#xD;
      Remaining wisdom teeth will be removed &quot;off-study&quot; at least three weeks following the first&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Successful preemptive analgesia strategies are superior to traditional pain management&#xD;
      schemes in the management of post-operative pain. However, agents with appropriate&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic properties are not readily available. The premise of this double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo and positive-controlled clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of vanilloid&#xD;
      agonists as preemptive agents in an oral surgery tissue injury model. Vanilloids are a class&#xD;
      of small organic compounds; the most familiar of which is capsaicin, the active ingredient in&#xD;
      hot pepper. Binding of capsaicin to the vanilloid-1 receptor produces initial activation and&#xD;
      then long-acting desensitization of pain specific neurons. We propose to produce a selective,&#xD;
      long-term inactivation of peripheral pain transmission through the local application of&#xD;
      capsaicin in the oral mucosa in an effort to prevent or reduce post-operative pain in the&#xD;
      oral surgery model. Healthy subjects will be recruited, and following local anesthesia, will&#xD;
      be given an intramucosal injection of either capsaicin or placebo. (Or as a positive control,&#xD;
      24 hours later, intravenous Toradol). Subjects will have one lower impacted wisdom tooth&#xD;
      extracted under local anesthesia and then will rate their pain. The time of analgesic rescue&#xD;
      medication request will be noted. A decrease in post-operative pain and decrease in analgesic&#xD;
      use will be taken as a positive effect of the vanilloid for decreasing post-operative pain.&#xD;
      We anticipate that through the long term blockade of pain specific fibers pre-operatively&#xD;
      that there will be a significant attenuation of post-operative pain development following&#xD;
      surgery. This has significant implications for reducing pain and suffering, decreasing&#xD;
      analgesic use, and reducing post-operative complications following surgery.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male or female volunteers referred for mandibular third molar extraction with a minimal&#xD;
        difficulty rating score of 3-4; the rating will be verified by the oral surgeon at time of&#xD;
        surgery.&#xD;
