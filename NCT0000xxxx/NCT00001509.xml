  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A body of preclinical data has provided a strong rationale for evaluating the combination of&#xD;
      IFN-alpha with retinoic acid. The two drugs have different mechanisms of action and, when&#xD;
      used in combination, show enhanced activity in both adult and pediatric tumor cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of the antiproliferative and differentiation inducing effect of retinoids&#xD;
      together with the antiproliferative, immunostimulatory and differentiation-potentiating&#xD;
      effects of IFN-alpha warrant clinical investigation of this combination for the treatment of&#xD;
      refractory pediatric malignancies.&#xD;

      A body of preclinical data has provided a strong rationale for evaluating the combination of&#xD;
      IFN-alpha with retinoic acid. The two drugs have different mechanisms of action and, when&#xD;
      used in combination, show enhanced activity in both adult and pediatric tumor cell lines. In&#xD;
      the pediatric phase I trial which administered ATRA for 3 consecutive days/week repeated&#xD;
      weekly, the AUC of ATRA decreased on day 1 to day 3 of drug administration but returned to&#xD;
      day 1 levels at the beginning of subsequent weeks. This intermittent schedule of ATRA&#xD;
      administration allowed for exposure to relatively high plasma concentrations of ATRA on a&#xD;
      repetitive basis. The combination of ATRA/IFN-alpha 2a has demonstrated clinical activity in&#xD;
      the pediatric phase I trial in neuroblastoma and Wilms' tumor. The combination of the&#xD;
      antiproliferative and differentiation inducing effect of retinoids together with the&#xD;
      antiproliferative, immunostimulatory and differentiation-potentiating effects of IFN-alpha&#xD;
      warrant clinical investigation of this combination for the treatment of refractory pediatric&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        AGE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must be less than or equal to 21 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PERFORMANCE STATUS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and a life expectancy of at&#xD;
        least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HISTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following diagnosis, confirmed by appropriate histologic examination,&#xD;
        will be eligible for this study: neuroblastoma and Wilms' tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MEASURABLE DISEASE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have measurable disease. Patients with evaluable disease only (i.e., limited&#xD;
        to positive bone scan or bone marrow) are eligible only if the bone involvement is&#xD;
        measurable by alternative imaging modalities (MRI, CT, or plain film).&#xD;
&#xD;
        PROGRESSIVE DISEASE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have evidence of progressive disease following or during prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEMATOLOGIC FUNCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients do not have to be evaluable for hematologic toxicity to be enrolled onto the&#xD;
        study. Patients without bone marrow involvement by tumor, with no history of BMT, and with&#xD;
        no prior cranio-spinal or pelvic radiation, will be considered evaluable for hematologic&#xD;
        toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients evaluable for hematologic toxicity must have adequate bone marrow function&#xD;
        (defined as peripheral absolute granulocyte count of greater than 1500/mm(3), hemoglobin&#xD;
        greater than 8.0 gm% and platelet count greater than 100,000/mm(3)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEPATIC FUNCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate liver function (bilirubin less than 2.0 mg%; SGPT less than 2&#xD;
        times normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        RENAL FUNCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate renal function defined as a creatinine clearance greater than&#xD;
        or equal to 70 ml/min/1.732 or a serum creatinine based on age as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        equal to or less than 5 years old: maximum serum creatinine 0.8;&#xD;
&#xD;
        older than 5 but equal to or less than 10: 1.0;&#xD;
&#xD;
        older than 10 but equal to or less than 15: 1.2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        older than 15: 1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        RECOVERY FROM PRIOR THERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy, and must be off of&#xD;
        all chemotherapy for a minimum of two weeks prior to entry onto the protocol (a minimum of&#xD;
        six weeks for prior nitrosoureas).&#xD;
&#xD;
        INFORMED CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients or their legal guardians must sign a document of informed consent indicating&#xD;
        their awareness of the investigational nature and the risks of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of CNS malignant disease, hydro-cephalus, or pseudotumor cerebri.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid within the prior three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
