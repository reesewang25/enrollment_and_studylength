      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with surgery may kill more tumor cells. It&#xD;
      is not yet known whether chemotherapy plus surgery is more effective than chemotherapy alone&#xD;
      in treating patients with stage II or stage III ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or&#xD;
      without surgery in treating patients with stage II or stage III ovarian cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the impact of interval debulking surgery, in terms of survival,&#xD;
      disease-free survival, and quality of life, in patients with newly diagnosed stage II or III&#xD;
      ovarian cancer and residual macroscopic disease greater than 1 cm after primary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study of debulking surgery with concurrent chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to receive chemotherapy alone (arm I) or chemotherapy and interval&#xD;
      debulking surgery (arm II). Arm I: Patients receive six courses of platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy at intervals of 3 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive three courses of&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy at intervals of 3 weeks. In the absence of disease progression,&#xD;
      patients undergo interval debulking surgery approximately 21 days after initiation of the&#xD;
      third course of chemotherapy. Surgery is then immediately followed by three additional&#xD;
      courses of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients are followed at 6 months after&#xD;
      randomization, then every 3 months for the remainder of the first 2 years, then every 6&#xD;
      months for the following 3 years, and then annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed&#xD;
      prior to randomization and before the fourth course of chemotherapy, and then at follow-up&#xD;
      visits at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 1,000 patients accrued into this study.&#xD;
