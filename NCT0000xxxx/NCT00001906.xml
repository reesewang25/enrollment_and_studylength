  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While vaccination against cutaneous leishmaniasis, a chronic ulcerating protozoan infection&#xD;
      of the skin, has been possible for decades using live parasites, the production and storage&#xD;
      of live cultures are difficult. Since inoculation occasionally leads to severe infection,&#xD;
      most experts now advocate against their use. We have shown excellent protection using a&#xD;
      &quot;heat-killed&quot; vaccine that combines autoclaved leishmania antigen with recombinant human&#xD;
      interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) and aluminum hydroxide gel as adjuvants in a rhesus macaque model of&#xD;
      disease. To assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans, we now propose a&#xD;
      rhIL-12 dose escalation Phase I/II trial.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Male or non-pregnant female 18 - 50 years of age at the time of screening and willing to&#xD;
        use effective birth control for one month post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination&#xD;
        before entering into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Available to participate for the duration of the study (approximately 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able to give signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        May not have received an investigational leishmania vaccine or skin test, or recombinant&#xD;
        human interleukin-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No use of an investigational drug or any vaccine other than the study vaccine within 30&#xD;
        days preceding the dose, or planned use during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No administration of chronic immunosuppressants (defined as more than 14 days) or other&#xD;
        immune-modifying drugs within six months of vaccination. (For corticosteroids, this will&#xD;
        mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids&#xD;
        are allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of prior leishmaniasis or of extensive travel to regions endemic for&#xD;
        leishmaniasis, such as southern Mexico, Central and most of South America, the&#xD;
        Mediterranean region and Middle East, Africa, and India.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human&#xD;
        immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of significant allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any&#xD;
        component.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No acute disease at the time of enrollment, defined as the presence of a moderate or severe&#xD;
        illness with or without fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal&#xD;
        function abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have suspected or known alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No other significant finding that, in the opinion of the investigator, would increase the&#xD;
        risk of having an adverse outcome from participating in this study.&#xD;
