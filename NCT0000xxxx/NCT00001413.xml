      The purpose of this study is to examine calcium absorption and bone mineral density in women&#xD;
      with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research indicates that pre-menopausal women with depression have significantly lower bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) than pre-menopausal women without depression. Although the mechanisms&#xD;
      of BMD loss are unclear, researchers believe that individuals with depression have impaired&#xD;
      calcium absorption. However, it is unknown whether the abnormal absorption is a result of&#xD;
      depression or a side effect of the drugs used to treat it. This study will compare calcium&#xD;
      absorption in women with depression and in healthy women without depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be given two non-radioactive calcium isotopes. One can be&#xD;
      taken by mouth and the other must be injected. Participants will have the level of isotopes&#xD;
      in their urine measured to estimate true fractional calcium absorption (TFCA). Participants&#xD;
      may also have a dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure total body adiposity and&#xD;
      lean body mass.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a condition that is underdiagnosed and undertreated, and often goes unnoticed&#xD;
      until a fragility fracture occurs after many years of progressive loss of bone quality. Risk&#xD;
      factors for osteoporosis include glucocorticoid excess and a pro-inflammatory state, both of&#xD;
      which we and others have observed in a substantial proportion of patients with Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found statistically and clinically significant reductions in bone mineral density&#xD;
      (BMD) in a group of 24 depressed but otherwise healthy pre-menopausal women, as compared to&#xD;
      24 healthy, closely matched controls. The difference was significant at several trabecular&#xD;
      bone sites (e.g., 13.6% at the femoral neck, 13.6% at the Ward's triangle, and 10.8% at the&#xD;
      trochanter). Epidemiological studies indicate that losses in trabecular bone mineral density&#xD;
      of these magnitudes are associated with an increased lifetime risk for fracture up to 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the mechanism(s) of the lower bone mineral density in our patients with past or&#xD;
      current depression has not yet been elucidated, these subjects showed significantly higher&#xD;
      24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion than their matched controls. However, the extent of&#xD;
      the lower bone mineral density in women with past or current depression cannot be accounted&#xD;
      for strictly on the basis of hypercortisolism alone, but is likely to require other hormonal&#xD;
      or biochemical factors as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data in subjects recruited from a large study of mothers with or without mood&#xD;
      disorders and their offspring indicate that a disproportionate number of young adult&#xD;
      offspring of mothers with Major Depressive Disorder show reduced BMD, 2/3 of whom had not yet&#xD;
      manifested clinical signs or symptoms of mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of the fact that major depression affects between 5% and 9% of the female&#xD;
      population, the depression-associated lower bone mineral density potentially predisposes&#xD;
      millions of women to enhanced susceptibility to osteoporosis. We therefore wish to continue&#xD;
      our assessment of bone mineral density in subjects with past or current depression to further&#xD;
      document the incidence of lower bone mineral density in a larger series. We also wish to&#xD;
      identify subjects with past or present depression who have reduced bone mineral density to&#xD;
      offer them the possibility of participating in other studies designed to clarify&#xD;
      pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in low bone mineral density, identify any clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of depressive illness that may predict increased risk of osteopenia or&#xD;
      osteoporosis, examine the association of low BMD with other endocrine and metabolic&#xD;
      disturbances seen in depressive illness, and to identify those who may require therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
