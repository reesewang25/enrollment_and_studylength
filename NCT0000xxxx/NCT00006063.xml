      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the efficacy of enteric coated pancrelipase with bicarbonate (PANCRECARB) capsules&#xD;
      versus the patient's usual enteric coated pancreatic enzyme without bicarbonate in decreasing&#xD;
      fecal fat and nitrogen losses in patients with cystic fibrosis.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. In the first treatment period,&#xD;
      patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive enteric coated pancrelipase with bicarbonate (PANCRECARB) capsules&#xD;
      before meals and snacks for 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive their usual enteric coated pancreatic enzyme without bicarbonate&#xD;
      capsule before meals and snacks for 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive approximately 50% of their usual lipase dose during treatment. Food intake&#xD;
      is recorded on days 1-3, food intake is weighed and recorded on days 4-7, and stools are&#xD;
      collected over 72 hours on days 5-7 to determine fecal fat and nitrogen excretion.&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and skinfolds are assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second treatment period, patients are switched to the alternate treatment arm after a&#xD;
      3 day washout period. Patients receive the opposing treatment as per protocol.&#xD;
