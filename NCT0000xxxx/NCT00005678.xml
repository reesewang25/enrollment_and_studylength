      To foster collaboration between the World Health Organization MONICA Project and the NHLBI&#xD;
      Study of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC). To ensure that valid comparisons could&#xD;
      made between findings in MONICA and ARIC by supporting activities to standardize coding,&#xD;
      classification, and analysis of coronary and stroke events, risk factors, and medical care&#xD;
      according to MONICA protocol.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MONICA Project was undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a ten year&#xD;
      international effort to measure the trends in cardiovascular mortality and coronary heart&#xD;
      disease and cerebrovascular disease morbidity and to assess the extent to which these trends&#xD;
      were related to changes in known risk factors, daily living habits, or major socioeconomic&#xD;
      features. Pilot studies were completed in 1981 in four countries and by 1985 there were 41&#xD;
      MONICA's in defined communities in 27 countries. Each study site covered a population of&#xD;
      around 300,000 persons and was expected to be studied for a decade. The centers measured the&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular disease--particularly coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      diseases--and assessed the extent to which these trends were related to changes in known risk&#xD;
      factors (smoking, blood lipids, blood pressure, diet), daily living habits, health care, and&#xD;
      major socioeconomic factors in the study populations. MONICA was also expected to introduce,&#xD;
      in the countries concerned, new health statistical methods that would lead to more effective&#xD;
      use of national health information systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an Associate Member of MONICA, NHLBI received copies of unclassified project documentation&#xD;
      and was represented at meetings of MONICA Principal Investigators. However, central data&#xD;
      analysis and quality control evaluations were not available to associate members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under this contract, NHLBI received summary tabulations of: population demographics and vital&#xD;
      statistics including the numbers of total deaths and of cardiovascular, coronary heart&#xD;
      disease and stroke deaths among residents of each Reporting Unit; fatal and non-fatal&#xD;
      coronary and stroke events; ECG abnormalities, chest pain symptoms, and cardiac enzyme&#xD;
      measurements; population survey prevalence rates and distributions of risk factors including&#xD;
      but not limited to blood pressure, total cholesterol, other lipids and lipoproteins, height,&#xD;
      weight, and cigarette consumption; hospitalizations and medical care for cardiovascular&#xD;
      conditions; case fatality rates within 28 days of onset of a heart attack, stroke, or other&#xD;
      cardiovascular event. The NHLBI also received reports on the quality of the data and&#xD;
      performance at each site based on the circulation and evaluation of test case histories.&#xD;
