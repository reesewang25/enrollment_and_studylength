  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the usefulness and safety of the antiviral drug foscarnet in treating AIDS&#xD;
      patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection that is causing sight-threatening inflammation&#xD;
      of the retina in one or both eyes (CMV retinitis). Because of the seriousness of&#xD;
      sight-threatening CMV retinitis in AIDS patients and a lack of other available treatments for&#xD;
      those patients who cannot be treated with ganciclovir (DHPG) (because of its toxic effect on&#xD;
      the body's blood-forming cells, because it did not control the disease, or because patient's&#xD;
      blood cell or platelet counts are too low to begin with), it is worthwhile to try an&#xD;
      immediate trial with foscarnet. AMENDED: ACTG 093 was originally designed as a randomized&#xD;
      dose-ranging study of foscarnet maintenance therapy. Patients enrolled between March 17,&#xD;
      1989, and January 1, 1990, received either 60 mg/kg/day or 90/mg/kg day as maintenance&#xD;
      therapy following the 2 week induction period. Based on the preliminary results of ACTG&#xD;
      015/915, which studied maintenance doses of foscarnet of 60 mg/kg/day, 90 mg/kg/day and 120&#xD;
      mg/kg/day, the 60-mg/kg/day and 90/mg/kg/day arms of this study have been closed. All&#xD;
      patients entering the study beginning January 2, 1990 will receive foscarnet maintenance&#xD;
      therapy on a 120/mg/kg/day algorithm following induction.&#xD;

      Because of the seriousness of sight-threatening CMV retinitis in AIDS patients and a lack of&#xD;
      other available treatments for those patients who cannot be treated with ganciclovir (DHPG)&#xD;
      (because of its toxic effect on the body's blood-forming cells, because it did not control&#xD;
      the disease, or because patient's blood cell or platelet counts are too low to begin with),&#xD;
      it is worthwhile to try an immediate trial with foscarnet. AMENDED: ACTG 093 was originally&#xD;
      designed as a randomized dose-ranging study of foscarnet maintenance therapy. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled between March 17, 1989, and January 1, 1990, received either 60 mg/kg/day or&#xD;
      90/mg/kg day as maintenance therapy following the 2 week induction period. Based on the&#xD;
      preliminary results of ACTG 015/915, which studied maintenance doses of foscarnet of 60&#xD;
      mg/kg/day, 90 mg/kg/day and 120 mg/kg/day, the 60-mg/kg/day and 90/mg/kg/day arms of this&#xD;
      study have been closed. All patients entering the study beginning January 2, 1990 will&#xD;
      receive foscarnet maintenance therapy on a 120/mg/kg/day algorithm following induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: The ACTG 093 optional extended maintenance therapy period will conclude on January&#xD;
      2, 1991 in order to facilitate timely analysis of this study. All patients who wish to&#xD;
      continue foscarnet therapy should be referred to Astra Protocol 90-FOS-14 at telephone number&#xD;
      800-292-5775. Original design: Patients are placed into two groups: (1) patients who have a&#xD;
      sight-threatening lesion in the retina of an eye with vision that can be saved (corrected&#xD;
      vision of 20/100 or better) and who cannot be treated with DHPG, and (2) patients whose&#xD;
      retinitis has quickly gotten worse and/or has shown resistance to DHPG treatment. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive a beginning (induction) dose of foscarnet by vein (IV) for 2 weeks, followed by&#xD;
      a maintenance dose for 8 weeks with an option to continue up to 24 weeks. AMENDED: Patients&#xD;
      entering the study on or after 01/02/90 receive the standard two week course of foscarnet&#xD;
      induction therapy and receive maintenance therapy. Treatment is given for a ten week study&#xD;
      period or until progression occurs or toxicity endpoints are reached. If retinitis is stable&#xD;
      and foscarnet well-tolerated, maintenance therapy may be extended for a period not to exceed&#xD;
      1 year.&#xD;
