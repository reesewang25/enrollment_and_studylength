  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some functions are generally controlled by the right side of the brain and others by the&#xD;
      left. One of the most easily observed examples of this &quot;lateral specialization&quot; of the brain&#xD;
      is handedness-that is, a person's preference for using either the right or the left hand.&#xD;
      This study will try to determine how the genetic component of handedness is inherited. It&#xD;
      will test the theory that a single gene is involved in determining handedness and will try to&#xD;
      locate the gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families with at least two left-handed siblings aged eight years or older and at least one&#xD;
      right-handed parent are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The left-handed siblings and both parents will fill out a brief questionnaire on hand usage,&#xD;
      obtain a tissue sample taken from inside the cheek, and return the questionnaire and the&#xD;
      sample by mail to the study researchers. The tissue sample will be used for DNA gene mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a kit and instructions for obtaining the sample, along with&#xD;
      mailing envelopes. Cheek swab sampling basically involves using a small brush to gently brush&#xD;
      a layer of cells off of the inner wall of the cheek and then dropping the brush tip into a&#xD;
      preservative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gained from this study may provide insight into aspects of brain development&#xD;
      that can be of medical benefit in the future.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol, based on the hypothesis that human hand-use preference&#xD;
      (handedness) is largely dependent on the action of a single locus, is to collect samples&#xD;
      allowing us to map a &quot;handedness gene&quot; via detection of linkage to any of eight potential&#xD;
      candidate genes/regions or via a whole or partial genome scan. We calculate that a full 300&#xD;
      marker genome scan of 100 parents and sibling pairs (allowing linkage analysis at 10 cM&#xD;
      resolution), or the equivalent amount of data from partial scans of 300 families, has a high&#xD;
      likelihood of allowing us to map the proposed gene. Eligible families, consisting of pairs of&#xD;
      left-handed siblings plus at least one right-handed parent, were identified during Phase I of&#xD;
      this study in 1996-1998, with approval from the now-lapsed FCRDC IRB. In Phase II of this&#xD;
      study, we have collected cheek swab samples for DNA isolation from members of 100 eligible&#xD;
      families for use in the mapping studies. DNA samples will not be linked back to individuals&#xD;
      but grouped under a random family code that links to a database with limited information,&#xD;
      including hand use preference and family structure. In the next phase, we wish to map the&#xD;
      locus from cheek swab samples we have on hand.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Members of families meeting the following criteria are eligible to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have two left-handed siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have at least one right-handed parent with no other known left-handed first degree&#xD;
        relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All members of a family may be excluded if the right-handed parents or the left-handed&#xD;
        siblings will not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals in families whose left-handed siblings are under the age of eight are not&#xD;
        eligible to participate.&#xD;
