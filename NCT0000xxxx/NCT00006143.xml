  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of recombinant human growth&#xD;
      hormone (r-hGH) on growth in HIV-infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that HIV-infected children do not grow at a normal rate and are shorter&#xD;
      than HIV-uninfected children who are the same age. Growth hormone has been used for many&#xD;
      years to treat children with growth hormone deficiency and has been safe and effective in&#xD;
      helping them to grow normally. The growth hormone to be used in this study, r-hGH, is an&#xD;
      investigational hormone (not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) made in&#xD;
      the laboratory. It has helped HIV-positive adults gain weight and improve their physical&#xD;
      performance. This study has been changed to include a needle-free device for drug delivery&#xD;
      which will improve patient comfort and acceptability. Patients will no longer receive growth&#xD;
      hormone through traditional needles but through a needle-free device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wasting, or loss of lean tissue, is a serious consequence of AIDS. Body composition findings&#xD;
      in HIV-infected children are similar to those of HIV-uninfected children with classic growth&#xD;
      hormone deficiency. Evidence suggests that therapeutic administration of growth hormone (GH)&#xD;
      can induce anabolic effects, reverse pathologic catabolism, and perhaps even improve immune&#xD;
      function. As survival to adolescence and beyond improves with modern therapy in children with&#xD;
      HIV infection, it will become increasingly important to address the problems of stunting and&#xD;
      short stature in this population. [AS PER AMENDMENT 09/04/01: Recent evidence suggests that&#xD;
      needle-free delivery is preferred by young children below the age of ten years. Given the&#xD;
      advantages of a needle-free delivery system for the administration of growth hormone, most&#xD;
      significantly the reduction of risk for HIV contaminated needle-stick injuries to care&#xD;
      providers and other household members, it has been decided to use this method of study drug&#xD;
      delivery for all study participants.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children are assigned randomly to 1 of the following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Children receive a single dose of r-hGH once a day. Group 2: Children receive half&#xD;
      the dose of r-hGH that Group 1 receives, once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3a: Children receive no r-hGH for the first 24 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: 48&#xD;
      weeks] of the study. After Week 24 [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: Week 48], they receive the&#xD;
      same dose as that of Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3b: Children receive no r-hGH for the first 24 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: 48&#xD;
      weeks] of the study. After Week 24 [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: Week 48], they receive the&#xD;
      same dose as that of Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcutaneous injections are administered [AS PER AMENDMENT 09/04/01: using a needle-free&#xD;
      device], daily for 96 weeks in Groups 1 and 2; after 24 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: 48&#xD;
      weeks] on study, the treatment-delayed control group (Group 3) receives injections for 72&#xD;
      weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: 48 weeks]. The first injection is at the clinic and&#xD;
      parents/guardians are trained how to prepare and administer the injections. Children are&#xD;
      closely monitored for toxicity, with dosing adjustments if needed. Evaluations and laboratory&#xD;
      tests are done at clinic visits every 4 weeks to determine growth indicators, body&#xD;
      chemistries, CD4 cell counts, HIV-1 RNA PCR, and anti-hGH antibodies and for routine&#xD;
      hematology testing, dietary intake assessment, and MRI scans. [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/03/01: MRI&#xD;
      scans are no longer performed.]&#xD;
