      To determine whether high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is more effective than&#xD;
      placebo in restoring lost visual function (visual acuity) in optic neuritis (ON).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the time course of recovery following IVIg administration. If the reports of&#xD;
      IVIg-associated clinical improvement occurring within 3 to 6 months following treatment can&#xD;
      be confirmed, this would provide indirect evidence that IVIg may promote central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) remyelination in optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optic neuritis is the leading cause of transient, spontaneous, reversible visual loss in&#xD;
      young adults. Characteristically, patients present with central visual loss that peaks within&#xD;
      a few days and is often associated with eye pain. Visual loss may be complete. Spontaneous&#xD;
      recovery usually begins within 4 weeks, and marked recovery occurs within 1 to 3 months in&#xD;
      most patients. Although clinical improvement is the rule, not all patients recover fully, and&#xD;
      many are left with residual symptoms. Although there are limited pathological studies in&#xD;
      inflammatory ON, the pathological changes are thought to be virtually identical with those&#xD;
      seen in MS, with disruption of the blood-nerve (brain) barrier; primary demyelination with&#xD;
      axonal sparing; variable degrees of lymphocytic infiltration; an abundance of macrophages&#xD;
      around the inflammatory demyelination lesion; various degrees of remyelination; and, later,&#xD;
      oligodendrocyte loss, axonal loss, and gliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remyelination by oligodendrocytes occurs early in the MS lesion, as documented by myelin&#xD;
      sheaths that are abnormally thin relative to axon diameter. These thin myelin sheaths are&#xD;
      often seen prominently at the edge of demyelinated plaques. A recent series of studies has&#xD;
      shown that within weeks of the initial event, there is extensive oligodendrocyte regeneration&#xD;
      and remyelination. These immature oligodendrocytes express a series of developmentally&#xD;
      restricted antigens. This finding has been interpreted to suggest that the cells that&#xD;
      repopulate the acute plaque and that affect remyelination are newly generated and not&#xD;
      residual, mature oligodendrocytes. These observations support the possibility that factors&#xD;
      that promote remyelination could be used to improve clinical recovery in ON and MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work at the Mayo Clinic, has shown that both immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against spinal&#xD;
      cord antigens and purified polyclonal mouse IgG administered systemically promote extensive&#xD;
      remyelination in SJL mice chronically infected with Theiler's virus. In addition, tissue&#xD;
      culture studies suggest that IgG directed against CNS components may promote oligodendroglial&#xD;
      proliferation and differentiation. Thus, experimental evidence exists for the concept that&#xD;
      immunoglobulins may stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. It&#xD;
      is possible that myelin components on the surface of oligodendrocytes could function as&#xD;
      receptors or components of receptors. Antibodies could mimic endogenous ligands, thereby&#xD;
      inducing the proliferation or differentiation of these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary, open-label pilot study of patients with chronic, steroid-unresponsive ON,&#xD;
      Drs. van Engelen, Hommes, and colleagues suggested that improvement in visual recovery could&#xD;
      be seen following IgG treatment in patients with chronic, stable ON. These encouraging but&#xD;
      preliminary basic and clinical studies have prompted us to design a double-blind and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial of IVIg in patients with recently acquired but apparently&#xD;
      permanent muscle paralysis from MS (NS31506) and to develop this NEI-funded ON study&#xD;
      (U10EY1096301).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 60 patients were&#xD;
      assigned to receive either IVIg or a placebo over a period of 3 months. In order to be&#xD;
      eligible, patients who meet the inclusion criteria needed to have a stable loss of visual&#xD;
      function (unchanged between the pre-enrollment screening visit and the enrollment visit). All&#xD;
      patients wre re-examined at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, with the primary outcome being the impact&#xD;
      of treatment on visual acuity at 6 months as determined by measurements on a retroilluminated&#xD;
      Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart at 4 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group of patients received 0.4 g/kg Gammimmune N intravenously daily for 5 days, and&#xD;
      thereafter once a month for 3 months (total: eight infusions). The other group of patients&#xD;
      received infusions of 0.1 percent human serum albumin in 10 percent maltose (placebo)&#xD;
      according to the identical protocol used for Gammimmune N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure was improvement in Logmar visual acuity by an average of 0.2 at 6&#xD;
      months. The secondary outcome measures included change in visual acuity at 3, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months, as determined on a retroilluminated ETDRS chart at 4 meters; change in visual fields&#xD;
      at 6 and 12 months; change in visual evoked responses at 3, 6, and 12 months; and change in&#xD;
      neurological examination (EDSS, FS, AI) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;

        To be eligible, patients must have a history of one or more episodes of previous&#xD;
        demyelinating optic neuritis occurring in the setting of classic, adult-onset definite MS&#xD;
        (clinically definite or laboratory-supported definite MS, or cranial MRI changes consistent&#xD;
        with MS). In most cases, onset of MS will have occurred between the ages of 18 and 45.&#xD;
        Patients must be younger than 50 years and must have apparently irreversible loss of visual&#xD;
        acuity that meets the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Visual acuity must be worse than 20/40 for at least 6 months. Patients must be able to read&#xD;
        at least one letter on the 1-meter eye chart. Patients with no light perception or hand&#xD;
        movement vision only are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The above level of visual dysfunction must be observed on at least two serial examinations&#xD;
        (separated by at least 1 month) in the Department of Ophthalmology at the Mayo Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Optic disc pallor must be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have impairment in the affected eye(s) on perimetry consistent with optic&#xD;
        nerve dysfunction and must have a visual field mean deviation of less than -4.00.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have received ACTH or corticosteroids within the preceding 2 months.&#xD;
