      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus is associated with a 2-4 fold increase in risk for atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, is the leading cause of death in diabetics. The study was a subproject within a&#xD;
      program project grant, with Henry Ginsberg as principal investigator. The program project was&#xD;
      part of an institute-initiated study on The Etiology of Excess Cardiovascular Disease in&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus. The initiative originated after discussions between NHLBI and the Juvenile&#xD;
      Diabetes Foundation International (JDFI). The Request for Applications (RFA) was originally&#xD;
      issued in October 1994 and resulted in the award of one grant The RFA was reissued in&#xD;
      December 1995 and resulted in the awarding of five program project grants, the one under&#xD;
      discussion among them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, subproject 3 within a program project grant, was entitled Atherogenic Triglyceride&#xD;
      Rich Lipoproteins in Diabetes. The subproject examined the atherogenicity of&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia in subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).&#xD;
      Subproject 3 tested hypotheses concerning the impact of the size and number of&#xD;
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) on risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (ASCVD) in several human populations. A case-control study of diabetics with or without&#xD;
      coronary artery disease determined if TGRL size and number differed between the groups. In&#xD;
      this study, Whites, Blacks and Hispanics with documented coronary artery disease or with less&#xD;
      than 50 percent coronary stenosis by angiography were recruited. The hypothesis was tested&#xD;
      that increased apoB in small TGRL was associated with coronary artery disease. Fasting and&#xD;
      postprandial blood samples were obtained for measurement of TGRL apoB level, TGRL TG:apoB&#xD;
      ratio, the amount of apoB in apoE-rich TGRL, and retinyl palmitate clearance. Allelic&#xD;
      differences in the apoB, apoE, LPL, and apoCIII genes were examined for effects on the size&#xD;
      and number of TGRL: specific hypotheses were tested regarding the impact of these alleles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TGRL size and number were also compared in diabetics with and without carotid atherosclerosis&#xD;
      in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, in Sioux and Pima Indian tribes that&#xD;
      differed in ASCVD rates, and in Blacks, Whites and Hispanics with a range of insulin levels&#xD;
      and insulin resistance in the Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS). These&#xD;
      studies served both to confirm findings in the case-control study and to provide the&#xD;
      opportunity to investigate diverse populations. The collaboration with IRAS allowed&#xD;
      determination of the effects of insulin resistance and insulin secretory capacity on TGRL&#xD;
      size and number. Finally, experiments with cultured endothelial cells were performed to&#xD;
      determine if small TGRL could cause endothelial dysfunction. PMI-1 and VCAM-1 were markers of&#xD;
      TGRL effects. In the case-control study, plasma PMI and VCAM-1 were measured to examine their&#xD;
      relationship to coronary artery disease and to TGRL size and number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dollars awarded were estimated based on the CRISP assignment of $173,249 dollars in FY 1996&#xD;
      for Subproject 3. This was approximately 25 percent of the total dollars awarded and was used&#xD;
      to estimated committed dollars.&#xD;
