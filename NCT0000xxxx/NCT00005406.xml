    <textblock>
      To prospectively examine changes in lipids, lipoproteins, and blood pressure among 295 young&#xD;
      adults who had been followed for sixteen years in the Beaver County Lipid Study. The Beaver&#xD;
      County Lipid Study tracked the cholesterol values of 295 children, ages 11 to 14 at baseline.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic studies of coronary risk factors have been performed primarily in populations&#xD;
      of middle-aged adults, children, and adolescents. Relatively little is known about these risk&#xD;
      factors in men and women 20-29 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study provided important insights into the determinants of coronary heart disease risk&#xD;
      factors in young adults and bolstered the argument of those who favor the early&#xD;
      identification of and intervention in the young coronary candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cross-sectional examinations had been carried out: 1) 1972-1973; 2) 1980-1981; and 3)&#xD;
      1988-1989. The study examined the predictors of change in total cholesterol (from examination&#xD;
      1 to examination 3, and change in LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides between examinations 2 and&#xD;
      3. It also investigated the stability in several health habits and behaviors such as&#xD;
      cigarette smoking, alcohol use, adherence to a low fat/low cholesterol diet, and physical&#xD;
      activity. Weight gain and oral contraceptive use had been shown in previous analyses to be&#xD;
      strong predictors of several lipids and lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
