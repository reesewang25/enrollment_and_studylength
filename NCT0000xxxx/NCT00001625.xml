  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, and who are overweight are known to have defects&#xD;
      in the way their body responds to insulin. The purpose of this study is to develop better&#xD;
      methods for measuring the way body tissue responds to insulin and sugar (glucose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are planning to study four groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Normal volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who have mild to moderate high blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who are overweight&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who have mild to moderate diabetes controlled with oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients and volunteers will undergo two separate tests designed to determine&#xD;
      how well insulin is working in the body. The first test is called a glucose clamp test.&#xD;
      Patients will have two needles placed in the veins of their arms. One needle will be used to&#xD;
      take blood samples, the other needle will be used to inject doses of sugar (glucose) and&#xD;
      insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second test is called the frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test. In this&#xD;
      test patients will have sugar (glucose) injected into their veins followed by a slow injected&#xD;
      dose (infusion) of insulin. Researchers will periodically take blood samples during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the study will not directly benefit from it. However, the&#xD;
      information gained from this study may be useful for improving the diagnosis and therapy of&#xD;
      diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure (hypertension).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the majority of the information needed to accurately estimate insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity is contained in the fasting insulin and glucose levels as well as the insulin and&#xD;
      glucose levels obtained shortly after an intravenous glucose load. We propose to test this&#xD;
      hypothesis by performing both hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps as well as&#xD;
      intravenous glucose tolerance tests on normal volunteers and groups of patients with&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, or obesity (diseases known to be associated with insulin resistance).&#xD;
      Data from these studies will be used obtain estimates of insulin sensitivity by the glucose&#xD;
      clamp method, minimal model method, and a novel analysis that utilizes only fasting and peak&#xD;
      levels of glucose and insulin. We hope to devise a simpler method for determining insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in vivo that is suitable for testing large populations. This method will require&#xD;
      only a few blood samples, take less than one hour to perform, and correlate with glucose&#xD;
      clamp estimates at least as well as the minimal model method.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal Volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults between the ages of 21 and 55 in good general health with no significant underlying&#xD;
        illnesses, on no medication, and a normal body mass index (20-26 kg/m(2)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Obese Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults between the ages of 21 and 55 in good general health with no significant underlying&#xD;
        illnesses, on no medication, and a body mass index between 30 and 35 kg/m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hypertensive Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults between the ages of 21 and 55 in good general health except for mild to moderate&#xD;
        hypertension (blood pressure between 140/95 and 170/109 off medication), on no medication&#xD;
        except for antihypertensive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be taken off all antihypertensive drugs for at least one week prior to study.&#xD;
        If a subjects blood pressure exceeds 180/110 on three determinations over a period of at&#xD;
        least 15 minutes, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and appropriate&#xD;
        antihypertensive therapy resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diabetic Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults between the ages of 21 and 65 in good general health except for non-insulin&#xD;
        dependent diabetes mellitus controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. Subjects on no other&#xD;
        medications. If fasting blood glucose exceeds 300 mg/dl, the subject will be withdrawn from&#xD;
        the study and appropriate therapy resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy, liver disease, pulmonary disease, end-organ damage such as renal insufficiency,&#xD;
        coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, proliferative&#xD;
        retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, or HIV infection.&#xD;
