  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares three different therapies for treatment of refractory Pneumocystis&#xD;
      carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with AIDS. &quot;Refractory&quot; means that the patient has failed&#xD;
      to respond to at least 4 days of treatment with either of two standard therapies: (1)&#xD;
      sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) or (2) pentamidine (PEN). This study compares therapy&#xD;
      with trimetrexate (TMTX) and leucovorin (LCV) to standard therapy and standard therapy plus&#xD;
      high-dose steroids (methylprednisolone). The purpose is to find better and safer forms of&#xD;
      treatment for PCP in AIDS patients. There is at present no scientific information about the&#xD;
      best treatment for an AIDS patient with PCP who is not improving while receiving the standard&#xD;
      therapies (SMX/TMP or PEN). New drug treatments are available, including steroid therapy and&#xD;
      TMTX, but there is no information proving that these new treatments work better than the&#xD;
      standard therapies.&#xD;

      There is at present no scientific information about the best treatment for an AIDS patient&#xD;
      with PCP who is not improving while receiving the standard therapies (SMX/TMP or PEN). New&#xD;
      drug treatments are available, including steroid therapy and TMTX, but there is no&#xD;
      information proving that these new treatments work better than the standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients who have failed to respond to at least 4 full days but no greater than&#xD;
      14 full days of therapy with SMX/TMP or PEN are randomly placed into one of three study&#xD;
      groups. Patients are stratified for (1) mechanical ventilation at enrollment, (2) prior&#xD;
      zidovudine therapy of at least 4 weeks duration, and (3) first versus subsequent episode of&#xD;
      PCP. One group of patients receives TMTX by intravenous infusion for 21 days and LCV for 24&#xD;
      days. The second and third group of patients receive either PEN or SMX/TMP depending on which&#xD;
      therapy they have already received and not improved on. The difference between the second and&#xD;
      third group is that the second group receives the conventional therapy (PEN or SMX/TMP) and a&#xD;
      placebo (inactive medication) and the third group receives the conventional therapy and&#xD;
      prednisolone. Neither investigators nor patients know whether patients receive&#xD;
      methylprednisolone. Patients continue study treatment until a study end point is reached or&#xD;
      for a minimum of 21 days (unless there is toxicity).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  physiologic replacement doses of steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patient who is HIV positive by ELISA, HIV&#xD;
             culture, or p24 antigenemia, or is a member of a risk group for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failed at least 4 but not &gt; 14 full days' therapy with either&#xD;
             sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) or parenteral pentamidine. Patients must have&#xD;
             received therapy with only one of the two conventional agents prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom an unequivocal diagnosis of this episode of PCP has been or can be&#xD;
             established by morphologic confirmation of three or more typical Pneumocystis carinii&#xD;
             organisms in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or lung tissue obtained by&#xD;
             transbronchial or open lung biopsy within 15 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom no significant improvement in arterial-alveolar oxygen pressure&#xD;
             (defined as a decrease of at least 15mm Hg) is observed in the 24 hours prior to&#xD;

             monitoring, and/or mechanical ventilation, during at least the first 7 days of&#xD;
             protocol therapy if such support is necessary. Continuation of maximal medical support&#xD;
             beyond 7 days is at discretion of investigator and patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of hypersensitivity less severe than type I may be enrolled if,&#xD;
