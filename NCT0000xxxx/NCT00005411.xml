    <textblock>
      To continue analysis of data from a longitudinal study of 246 urban Black preschool children&#xD;
      and their families in order to identify the long-term effects of social and environmental&#xD;
      influences on nutrition and activity and the consequences of these influences for the&#xD;
      children's cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk status.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study contributed to understanding the development of patterns of eating and exercise,&#xD;
      focusing on environmental influences that promoted healthful life styles and prevented risk&#xD;
      behaviors for CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data set included additional measures of activity and nutrition of the preschool child as&#xD;
      well as measures of the activity of an older sibling and mother. The data were gathered in&#xD;
      the homes and schools of the children and included both self-report and direct measurement of&#xD;
      activity and nutrition. Additional assessments of activity, lipid fractions and&#xD;
      apolipoproteins, and Type A Behavior Patterns and Life Stress in the preschool child, i.e.,&#xD;
      target child , an older sibling and the children's mother added considerably to the&#xD;
      complexity and value of the data set permitting additional questions regarding the&#xD;
      development of activity, the influences of siblings and parents on this development, and the&#xD;
      relationship to CVD risk status and Type A Behavior Patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses addressed included 1. Activity levels and the activities selected showed&#xD;
      increasing stability with age in preschool and older Black children. 2. The influence of&#xD;
      parental prompts and family environment on activity increased asymptotically with age: The&#xD;
      effects increased during early childhood; the effects did not increase significantly in older&#xD;
      children. 3. Older sibling's influence on the target child's behavior increased with age. The&#xD;
      target child's CVD risk status became more like the older sibling's with age. 4. Perceptions&#xD;
      of recent Life Stress and ratings of Type A Behavior Patterns for target child, the older&#xD;
      sibling, and mother were predisposing variables that were positively related to the target&#xD;
      child's activity. 5. Long-term patterns of physical activity were associated with HDL and apo&#xD;
      A-1 in the target child and the older sibling; the effect was stronger for the older sibling.&#xD;
      Long-term patterns of the target child's nutrient intake were associated with his/her lipid&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
