      RATIONALE: Inserting a modified herpesvirus gene into a person's melanoma cells may make the&#xD;
      cancer more sensitive to the antiviral agent ganciclovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients who&#xD;
      have stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ganciclovir administered IV every 12&#xD;
      hours for 7 days in combination with adenovirus RSV-TK administered by direct intralesional&#xD;
      injection in patients with cutaneous or subcutaneous metastatic malignant melanoma. II.&#xD;
      Determine the dose limiting toxicities of this regimen in this patient population. III.&#xD;
      Evaluate the response (both local and at distant metastatic sites), duration of response,&#xD;
      response by ganciclovir dose, and any impact local treatment with adenovirus RSV-TK and&#xD;
      ganciclovir &quot;suicide&quot; gene therapy may have on overall survival in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ganciclovir. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      response of the index lesion and other metastatic disease sites. Patients receive an&#xD;
      intratumoral injection of adenovirus RSV-TK on day 1. Ganciclovir IV is administered every 12&#xD;
      hours on days 3-10 for a total of 14 doses. Patients sustaining a partial response (PR) or&#xD;
      complete response (CR) may be retreated 2 weeks after documented PR or CR. Cohorts of 3-6&#xD;
      patients receive escalating doses of ganciclovir until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed at 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 60 days, then every 2&#xD;
      months for 6 months, and then every 3 months for 1.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
