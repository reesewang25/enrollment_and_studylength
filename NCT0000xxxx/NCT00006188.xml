    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with inflammatory eye diseases, such&#xD;
      as uveitis. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will&#xD;
      receive current standard of care treatments. The purpose of the study is twofold: 1) to allow&#xD;
      National Eye Institute physicians to increase their knowledge of inflammatory eye conditions&#xD;
      and identify new avenues of possible research in this area; and 2) to establish a pool of&#xD;
      patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are developed. (Participants in this&#xD;
      protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision will be voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults with uveitis and other inflammatory eye diseases may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, brief physical examination,&#xD;
      thorough eye examination and blood tests. The eye examination includes measurements of visual&#xD;
      acuity (ability to see the vision chart), eye pressure and dilation of the pupils to examine&#xD;
      the lens and retina (back part of the eye). Patients may also undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fundus photography - Special photographs of the inside of the eye to help evaluate the&#xD;
           status of the retina and evaluate changes that may occur in the future. From 2 to 20&#xD;
           pictures may be taken, depending on the eye condition. The camera flashes a bright light&#xD;
           into the eye for each picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fluorescein angiography - Procedure to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye&#xD;
           injected into an arm vein travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the&#xD;
           retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures&#xD;
           show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood&#xD;
           vessel abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed at least 3 years. Follow-up visits are scheduled according to&#xD;
      the standard of care for the individual patient's eye problem. Vision will be checked at each&#xD;
      visit, and some of the screening tests described above may be repeated to follow the progress&#xD;
      of disease and evaluate the response to treatment.&#xD;

      This &quot;Evaluation and Treatment Protocol&quot; will allow the uveitis specialists and ocular&#xD;
      immunologists at the NEI to identify, follow and provide &quot;standard of care&quot; treatment to&#xD;
      patients with uveitis and other intraocular inflammatory disorders. A primary purpose of the&#xD;
      protocol is to accumulate a cohort of patients with uveitis or other intraocular inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases for possible participation in new NEI clinical trials and epidemiological protocols.&#xD;
      Also, by providing long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of uveitic or other&#xD;
      intraocular inflammatory disorders, the uveitis specialists and ocular immunologists at NEI&#xD;
      will be better able to identify research hypotheses about these diseases in addition to&#xD;
      maintaining their clinical skills. The availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of&#xD;
      uveitic disorders will be valuable for the training of fellows in intraocular inflammatory&#xD;
      disease, an important mission of the NEI. The ability to provide long-term follow-up and care&#xD;
      will also facilitate referral efforts for new NEI protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uveitis specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those ocular&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be&#xD;
      enrolled in the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new&#xD;
      treatments. Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current&#xD;
      standard of care for each uveitic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for&#xD;
      potential eligibility in any new NEI clinical trials or epidemiologic protocols as they are&#xD;
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However,&#xD;
      they will not be required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be&#xD;
      entirely voluntary. No more than 150 patients will be accepted in this &quot;Evaluation and&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol.&quot;&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are initially screened for NEI protocols under the NEI screening protocol or from&#xD;
        the closeout of another protocol. Some of these patients will have a uveitic or other&#xD;
        intraocular inflammatory condition that NEI staff wishes to follow and treat. Such patients&#xD;
        can the be enrolled in this evaluation and treatment protocol. Each study participant must&#xD;
        have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from this study if they are unable or unwilling to give informed&#xD;
        consent or the are unwilling to be followed and treated at the NEI clinical center for at&#xD;
        least the next 3 years.&#xD;
