  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study of interleukin-1, G-CSF and high dose ICE chemotherapy with&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow transplant in patients with relapsed breast, testicular and lymphoid&#xD;
      cancers. The initial goal of this study was to define the toxicity of interleukin-1&#xD;
      administered for 7 days prior to ICE chemotherapy. A total of 22 patients have been treated&#xD;
      with IL-1 and ICE and results showed a more rapid engraftment (4.5 days) with IL-1. A second&#xD;
      cohort of 18 patients also received G-CSF and engraftment was further shortened in some&#xD;
      subgroups. Overall, the median time to engraftment was 16 days with both IL-1 and G-CSF.&#xD;
      Accrual will continue to further define the toxicity and efficacy of this regimen.&#xD;
