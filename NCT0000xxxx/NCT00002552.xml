      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining bone marrow transplantation with chemotherapy may allow&#xD;
      doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving a bone marrow transplant&#xD;
      together with chemotherapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with refractory&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicities, response rate, and duration of response associated with&#xD;
      high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carmustine or high-dose cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      total-body irradiation followed by autologous, allogeneic, or syngeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant in patients with refractory or high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's&#xD;
      disease, or multiple myeloma. II. Evaluate any prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients with prior radiotherapy (greater than 2,000 cGy) receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over at least 30 minutes on days -7 through -4 followed by&#xD;
      carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -3. Patients receive allogeneic or autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation on day 0. Patients with or without prior radiotherapy (less than 2,000 cGy)&#xD;
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -8 through -5 followed by total body&#xD;
      irradiation on days -4 through -1. Patients receive allogeneic or autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation on day 0. Prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation and following&#xD;
      myeloablative chemotherapy, patients undergo mobilization consisting of cytarabine&#xD;
      subcutaneously every 12 hours for 6 doses. Approximately 24 hours later, patients receive&#xD;
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously. Peripheral blood stem cells are collected every 1-3&#xD;
      days beginning when blood counts recover and continuing until sufficient number of cells are&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
