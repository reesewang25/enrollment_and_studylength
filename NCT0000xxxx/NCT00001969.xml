  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A series of studies in patients with major depression have consistently demonstrated a&#xD;
      doubling of the mortality rate at any age, independent of suicide. In addition, the relative&#xD;
      risk for clinically significant coronary artery disease in patients with major depression is&#xD;
      also 2 or more in studies that independently controlled for risk factors such as smoking,&#xD;
      hypertension, etc. The principal long-term goals of the CNE include the determination of the&#xD;
      mechanisms that underlie enhanced susceptibility to premature ischemic heart disease in&#xD;
      patients with major depression, documenting the age at which demonstrable pathophysiologic or&#xD;
      predictive changes begin to occur, and charting their rate of progression. Our long-term goal&#xD;
      is to use our understanding of underlying mechanisms to enhance our capacity to predict who&#xD;
      with major depression is most likely to develop premature ischemic heart disease, to&#xD;
      determine what the mechanisms underlying this susceptibility are, and to develop improved&#xD;
      means for treatment and prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressed patients are known to manifest a variety of neuroendocrine changes that predispose&#xD;
      to coronary artery disease including hypercortisolism, decreased secretion of growth hormone&#xD;
      and a deficiency of sex steroids. A final common denominator of these neuroendocrine&#xD;
      abnormalities is insulin resistance. Insulin resistance promotes several changes that would&#xD;
      favor hypertension and increased coronary artery disease including increased sodium&#xD;
      retention, increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, proliferation of vascular&#xD;
      smooth muscle and deposition of highly metabolically active visceral fat. The latter induces&#xD;
      additional risk factors for coronary disease, including dyslipidemia, hypercoagulation, and&#xD;
      enhanced inflammation. It is a matter of public health importance to document the frequency&#xD;
      and severity of insulin resistance in patients with major depression compared to a closely&#xD;
      matched group of healthy controls. To accurately quantify insulin resistance in each patient&#xD;
      and control, we will apply the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp procedure. This is&#xD;
      the gold standard method for measuring the insulin sensitivity since it reflects the direct&#xD;
      human body glucose metabolic response to a known insulin infusion. Moreover, it is essential&#xD;
      to use this technique in patients with major depression as data indicate that other&#xD;
      alternative procedures give unreliable results in the context of hypercortisolism.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults between the ages of 21 and 55, with or without major depression as diagnosed with&#xD;
        The Structured Clinical Interview of Diagnosis (SCID) of the Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
        Manual of Mental Disorder, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), will be recruited. All depressed&#xD;
        patients will be included, although we will characterize patients a priori as having a&#xD;
        predominantly melancholic, atypical, or mixed symptom pattern. We plan to recruit at least&#xD;
        20 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both currently depressed patients (greater than 14 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale)&#xD;
        and those with a history of major depression who are clinically recovered will be included.&#xD;
        Patients may be taking psychotropic medications for depression at the time of study.&#xD;
        Sub-analyses will be done comparing steady-state glucose utilization rates as a function of&#xD;
        mood state and medication status. Subjects should not have significant underlying illnesses&#xD;
        known to affect insulin sensitivity, and should have a body mass index between 20 and 30&#xD;
        kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Existing diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index less than 20 or greater than 30 kg/ m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Existing cardiovascular diseases and other end organ diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Existing peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are on B-blockers, thiazides, and/or glucocorticoids and cannot&#xD;
             discontinue these medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who are on oral contraceptives need to discontinue the medication for 1-2&#xD;
             days before the clamp study.&#xD;
