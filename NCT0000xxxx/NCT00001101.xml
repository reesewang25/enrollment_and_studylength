  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the United States. It is caused by the&#xD;
      spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. It may exist in a chronic form and be the result of: 1)&#xD;
      active infection by B. burgdorferi; 2) damage caused by the original infectious process; or&#xD;
      3) the presence of co-infection with another organism transmitted by Ixodes ticks. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness, for seropositive&#xD;
      patients, of intensive antibiotic treatment in eliminating symptoms of Chronic Lyme Disease&#xD;
      (CLD).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One hundred ninety-four (194) patients will be enrolled in this study. Each patient will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups and will be randomly selected to receive either antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy or placebo; but, the assignment of medication will not be made known to the patient&#xD;
      or administering doctor. Antibiotic or placebo will be given intravenously (IV) for 30&#xD;
      consecutive days and then orally for the next 60 consecutive days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        You may be eligible for this study if you:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are seropositive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi antigens by Western Blot at&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have documented history of acute Lyme disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had a rash (erythema migrans) that resembles a bullseye. This skin aberration&#xD;
             usually occurs after a tick bite in late spring, summer or early fall and is sometimes&#xD;
             accompanied by fatigue, fever, headache, mild stiff neck, arthralgia or myalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had one or more clinical features typical of Lyme disease acquired in the United&#xD;
             States (see technical summary).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had one or more of the following symptoms and conditions that have persisted for&#xD;
             at least 6 months (but less than 12 years) and are not attributable to another cause&#xD;
             or condition: a) widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue that began coincident&#xD;
             with or within 6 months following initial infection with B. burgdorferi. b) certain&#xD;
             neurologic symptoms including memory impairment and nerve pain within 6 months&#xD;
             following initial infection with B. burgdorferi.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had a physician-documented history of prior antibiotic treatment with a currently&#xD;
             recommended antibiotic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        You will not be eligible for this study if you:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have previously enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant, lactating, or unable to use birth control measures during the treatment&#xD;
             period of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking chronic medication that could interfere with evaluation of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking or have taken various medications that could interfere with the evaluation&#xD;
             of symptoms (see technical summary).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are hypersensitive to ceftriaxone or doxycycline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have active inflammatory synovitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have another disease that could account for symptoms of acute Lyme disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have another serious disease or an active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are unable to tolerate an IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have tested positive for Borrelia DNA in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid at the time of&#xD;
             initial evaluation for study.&#xD;
