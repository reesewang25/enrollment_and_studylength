    <textblock>
      To determine the relative effectiveness of moderate versus more aggressive lipid lowering,&#xD;
      and of low dose anticoagulation versus placebo, in delaying saphenous vein coronary bypass&#xD;
      graft atherosclerosis and preventing occlusion of saphenous grafts of patients with saphenous&#xD;
      vein coronary bypass grafts placed 1 to 11 years previously.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of studies have reported that following CABG, the vessels proximal to the&#xD;
      grafts demonstrate accelerated atherosclerosis and the grafts themselves may show progressive&#xD;
      obstruction due to thrombosis, fibrosis, and graft atheroma. Pathological and clinical&#xD;
      studies have documented that graft obstruction during the perioperative period and the first&#xD;
      year is usually due to technical problems at surgery or thrombosis and occurs in about 15 to&#xD;
      20 percent of saphenous vein grafts. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin have been shown to&#xD;
      reduce these early graft occlusions by about 50 percent. In addition to thrombosis, during&#xD;
      the first year, most saphenous vein grafts undergo diffuse fibrosis and some distortion.&#xD;
      However, the significance of these changes is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first year, lipid deposition and changes histologically similar to atherosclerosis&#xD;
      have been documented both in experimental studies and in human saphenous vein grafts patent&#xD;
      at one year completely occlude and an additional 30 percent narrow over a period of ten&#xD;
      years. These angiographic changes in the saphenous vein grafts correlate with high&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol, low HDL-cholesterol and high apolipoprotein B levels. In experimental&#xD;
      animals, cholesterol deposition in the grafts has been substantially increased or decreased&#xD;
      by increasing or decreasing the saturated fats and cholesterol in the animal's diets. In&#xD;
      contrast to changes in the saphenous vein grafts, internal mammary artery grafts have shown&#xD;
      substantially lower rates of obstruction. The native vessels (both ungrafted vessels and&#xD;
      grafted vessels at distal or proximal sites), however, show evidence of progressive&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. The long-term follow-up of grafts also demonstrates thrombotic material and&#xD;
      even occlusive thrombus as part of acute events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression of atherosclerotic lesions in grafts and native vessels lead to recurrent angina,&#xD;
      unaltered long-term survival and reduced efficacy of repeat CABG surgery. Johnson in an 11&#xD;
      year follow-up of 3,105 post-CABG patients, reported that about 15 percent of patients with&#xD;
      preoperative angina have recurrent angina at 1 year; with a further 6 percent developing&#xD;
      angina every subsequent year. In this study, patients with recurrent angina had twice the&#xD;
      mortality compared to those who were angina-free. Long-term follow-up of the VA Cooperative&#xD;
      Trial of CABG shows that the survival of the surgical group appears to be initially superior&#xD;
      compared to the medical group but this benefit is diminished by about ten years. This may&#xD;
      relate to graft obstruction and progression of native coronary atherosclerosis. Re-operation&#xD;
      in these patients carries a higher operative mortality risk and the results are less&#xD;
      impressive. It had been estimated that approximately 5 percent of all CABG surgery in 1984&#xD;
      were re-operations and that this percentage would double over the next decade. Therefore,&#xD;
      measures to prevent graft occlusion and progression of atherosclerosis in native vessels, if&#xD;
      successful, could have substantial clinical and economic importance by reducing mortality,&#xD;
      morbidity and the numbers of patients undergoing re-operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from trials of aspirin and dipyridamole in post-CABG patients that demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant reduction in graft closure within the first year after surgery, there were no&#xD;
      large systematic studies of interventions in these patients. Graft occlusion has been shown&#xD;
      to correlate with high LDL-cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol, and the severity of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis has been additionally shown to be related to cigarette smoking and increased&#xD;
      levels of coagulation factor. Therefore, lowering the LDL cholesterol (by diet and drugs),&#xD;
      and anti-thrombotic therapy with warfarin were logical choices for intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggested that CABG surgery relieved angina and improved overall quality of&#xD;
      life. However, in the available studies, CABG did not consistently appear to be associated&#xD;
      with an improvement in employment status, physical recreational activity, or life style. The&#xD;
      reasons for these results were not entirely clear and there was a need to identify the&#xD;
      biobehavioral and psychosocial factors that predicted successful adjustment after CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiative was proposed by Institute staff and approved by the September 1985 National&#xD;
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Proposals was released in September&#xD;
      1985 and awards made in April 1987.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. All prospective participants&#xD;
      received active warfarin treatment for a month prior to randomization. Only participants&#xD;
      demonstrating a minimal reaction to warfarin and consuming over 90 percent of the prescribed&#xD;
      medication were randomized. Dietary modification to lower serum cholesterol, an exercise&#xD;
      program, and a smoking cessation program were implemented. Patients were randomly assigned in&#xD;
      a 2 X 2 factorial design in four treatment groups: aggressive LDL-C lowering with lovastatin&#xD;
      40 to 80 mg/d and, as necessary cholestyramine 8 mg/d to achieve and LDL-C of 60 to 85 mg/dl;&#xD;
      moderate LDL-C lowering with lovastatin 2.5 to 5 mg/d, with cholestyramin as needed, to&#xD;
      achieve a LDL-C of 130 to 140 mg/dl; warfarin 1 to 4 mg/d to achieve an INR of 1.8 to 2.0;&#xD;
      and warfarin-placebo. All participants were followed for five years, at the end of which&#xD;
      selective coronary and graft angiography was performed. The primary angiography endpoint was&#xD;
      the proportion of major SVG per patient that showed substantial reduction (0.06 mm or&#xD;
      greater) in lumen diameter. Biobehavioral studies were conducted in 750 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning for the study began in April 1987 and a final protocol was developed by August 1988.&#xD;
      Patient recruitment has been completed. Follow-up ended on September 1, 1995 and data&#xD;
      analysis continues through December 1998 under contract N01-HC-75076. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Post CABG Biobehavioral Study examined a cohort of 759 coronary artery bypass patients&#xD;
      (269 women and 490 men) who were enrolled at five clinical centers. Sociodemographic and&#xD;
      medical data were obtained by interview and from medical charts. Health-related quality of&#xD;
      life and psychosocial data were ascertained preoperatively by interview and questionnaire for&#xD;
      those patients whose condition allowed preoperative assessment and was compared among&#xD;
      patients from hospitals enrolling both male and female patients.&#xD;
