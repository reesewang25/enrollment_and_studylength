      To examine the impact of an interaction between common genetic susceptibility markers and&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inherited factors play a role in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI), and there is&#xD;
      growing interest in identifying common genetic susceptibility markers that interact with&#xD;
      common environmental exposures to contribute to the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI)&#xD;
      in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had a case-control design. The preliminary data addressed the contribution of&#xD;
      common genetic and environmental factors to the risk of MI among women under 45 years of age.&#xD;
      Those data showed that common polymorphisms in genes coding for two clotting factors,&#xD;
      coagulation Factor V and coagulation Factor II, were risk factors for MI only among cigarette&#xD;
      smokers in this sample. These relationships, and others observed, provided strong evidence of&#xD;
      gene-environment interactions between thrombotic and atherosclerotic factors in early-onset&#xD;
      MI. One intent was to determine whether the risk of early-onset MI was related to&#xD;
      interactions between environmental factors (e.g., cigarette smoking, exercise, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption) and common polymorphisms in genes coding for thrombotic factors (coagulation&#xD;
      Factor V, coagulation Factor II, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and beta-fibrinogen) and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic factors (the adhesion molecule E-selectin and metalloproteinase&#xD;
      stromelysin-1; the lipid metabolism enzymes paraoxinase, lipoprotein lipase, cholesterol&#xD;
      ester transfer protein; and the apolipoproteins apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein B).&#xD;
      Additionally, there were plans to determine whether the risk of early-onset MI was related to&#xD;
      interactions between plasma lipoprotein(a) levels (which were largely genetically determined)&#xD;
      and environmental risk factors and/or polymorphisms in the candidate genes. Interactions&#xD;
      among candidate polymorphisms were also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly-diagnosed cases of MI and controls will be interviewed in person to assess medical and&#xD;
      behavioral characteristics related to MI risk. A venous blood sample will be obtained and&#xD;
      processed into aliquots of plasma and white cells. DNA extracted from the white cells will be&#xD;
      tested using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR/restriction fragment length&#xD;
      polymorphisms (RFLP), and oligonucleotide ligation assays to determine the genotypes of&#xD;
      interest. Plasma will be tested for lipid, lipoprotein, and homocysteine concentrations.&#xD;
      Analyses will address both the overall association between the genotypes and MI risk, along&#xD;
      with posited gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.&#xD;
