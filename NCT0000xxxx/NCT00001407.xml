  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine what dose of recombinant interferon-gamma is safe and effective for&#xD;
      treating multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis. Recombinant interferon-gamma is a genetically&#xD;
      engineered form of a substance normally produced by the body and is used to boost immune&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 5 years of age and older with multiply drug-resistant tuberculosis may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to either the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the&#xD;
      Texas Center for Infectious Diseases in San Antonio or the South Texas Hospital or Valley&#xD;
      Baptist Hospital, both in Harlingen, Texas. On admission, patients will have a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, sputum culture, X-rays, pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests and a computed tomography (CT) scan. CT produces 3-dimensional images of body&#xD;
      tissues and organs in small sections. For the procedure, the patient lies still on a table&#xD;
      surrounded by the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will continue treatment with anti-tuberculosis antibiotics during and after the&#xD;
      study period and may elect whether or not to take gamma interferon in addition to the&#xD;
      antibiotic. Five patients will receive only antibiotic treatment, and 5 each will receive one&#xD;
      of 3 doses (0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 milligrams per square meter of body surface area) of&#xD;
      interferon-gamma injected under the skin 3 times a week. The patient or caregiver will be&#xD;
      taught to give the injections, which are similar to insulin injections for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be in isolation in the hospital from the start of therapy until sputum samples&#xD;
      show no evidence of tuberculosis for 3 consecutive weeks. Following that, they will repeat&#xD;
      the tests done on admission (except CT) during follow-up visits (1- to 2-day&#xD;
      hospitalizations) at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months after the start of therapy. Patients&#xD;
      taking interferon gamma will have blood drawn more frequently (monthly) for the first 6&#xD;
      months, and patients with lung infection will have sputum samples collected more&#xD;
      frequently-weekly for the first 3 months or until three consecutive negative samples are&#xD;
      obtained and then monthly throughout the course of therapy. Patients with lung infection will&#xD;
      also have repeat CT scans at 6 and 12 months while on interferon gamma. In one or two&#xD;
      patients on the drug, blood will be drawn frequently following one injection of gamma&#xD;
      interferon (just before the injection and again at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hours&#xD;
      after it) to see if a difference in blood levels of the drug can be detected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, controlled, open label, dose escalation study to determine the&#xD;
      tolerance, toxicity, and clinical effect of the administration of interferon-gamma on the&#xD;
      clinical condition and immune function of patients with multiply drug resistant M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis infections (MDRTB). The study drug (interferon gamma) will be administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously three times a week at three dose levels (0.025 mg/m(2), 0.05 mg/m(2), 0.1&#xD;
      mg/m(2)) for one year in addition to anti-tuberculous medications, as determined by in vitro&#xD;
      sensitivities.&#xD;

        ELIGIBLITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical and microbiologic/histologic demonstration of MDRTB, either disseminated (i.e.&#xD;
        infection at 2 or more non-contiguous sites) or pulmonary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preserved renal function (creatinine less than or equal to 2 mg/100 ml; less than or equal&#xD;
        to 2+ proteinuria).&#xD;

        than 1500/mm3; platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of childbearing potential may be entered if using effective contraception and&#xD;
