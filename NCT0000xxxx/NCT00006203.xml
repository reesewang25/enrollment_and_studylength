  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 5-week study will examine the effects of naltrexone on alcohol craving, drinking rates,&#xD;
      and reaction to drinking-related triggers, or cues, in participants' everyday environment and&#xD;
      in laboratory sessions. Participants will monitor and record their daily desires to drink,&#xD;
      environmental circumstances in which urges occur, and drinking behavior using a palm top&#xD;
      computer. Participants will receive naltrexone or a placebo. One week after receiving&#xD;
      medication, all participants will be asked to respond to alcohol-related cues that may or may&#xD;
      not arouse the desire to drink.&#xD;
