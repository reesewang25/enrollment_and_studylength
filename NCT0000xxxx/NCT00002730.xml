      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Some tumors become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Combining&#xD;
      buthionine sulfoximine with chemotherapy may reduce resistance to the drug and allow more&#xD;
      tumor cells to be killed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan, buthionine sulfoximine, and&#xD;
      G-CSF in treating children with progressive neuroblastoma that has not responded to previous&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the toxic effects of combined chemotherapy with buthionine&#xD;
      sulfoximine (BSO) and melphalan (L-PAM) in pediatric patients with progressive neuroblastoma.&#xD;
      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of BSO/L-PAM in pediatric patients. III. Assess the&#xD;
      ability of BSO to deplete glutathione by at least 90% in tumor metastatic to bone marrow, in&#xD;
      normal marrow, and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. IV. Estimate the response rate in these&#xD;
      patients treated with BSO/L-PAM within the confines of a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: BSO Buthionine sulfoximine, NSC-326231 L-PAM&#xD;
      Melphalan, NSC-8806 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor, NSC-614629 Single-Agent&#xD;
      Chemotherapy with Drug Resistance Inhibition. L-PAM/BSO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 18 patients will be entered to provide an adequate number of&#xD;
      patients with marrow involvement; if the BSO dose is increased to achieve adequate GSH&#xD;
      depletion in the marrow, an additional 12 patients will be entered. If less than 50% of&#xD;
      patients have tumor metastatic to marrow at entry, there will be a proportional increase in&#xD;
      the total number of patients required.&#xD;
