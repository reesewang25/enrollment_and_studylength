      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop&#xD;
      cancer cells from growing. Peripheral stem cell transplantation combined with biological&#xD;
      therapy may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with filgrastim to&#xD;
      stimulate cell production in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, metastatic, or&#xD;
      recurrent breast cancer who will undergo peripheral stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of continuous infusion interleukin-2&#xD;
      (IL-2) that can be combined with a standard dose of filgrastim (G-CSF) to stimulate&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for harvest in patients with advanced breast cancer. II.&#xD;
      Assess PBSC engraftment following high dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (the&#xD;
      STAMP V regimen) supported by G-CSF or IL-2/G-CSF hematopoietic support in patients who&#xD;
      underwent the same pretransplant PBSC stimulation. III. Characterize the toxic effects of&#xD;
      combined IL-2 and G-CSF. IV. Compare immune function changes following IL-2/G-CSF and G-CSF&#xD;
      alone by assessing expression of CD56/CD56-bright, CD3, and CD25; natural killer cell and&#xD;
      lymphokine activated killer cell activity; T-cell responses (TT, HER2/neu); and serum levels&#xD;
      of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and G-CSF. V. Compare the effects on the expression&#xD;
      of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+, CFU-GM, and BFU-GM) of a range of IL-2&#xD;
      doses when combined with G-CSF to those achieved with G-CSF alone. VI. Compare the time to&#xD;
      neutrophil and platelet recovery, requirements for red blood cell and platelet transfusion,&#xD;
      and time to hospital discharge in patients receiving IL-2/G-CSF-primed vs. G-CSF-primed PBSC&#xD;
      following STAMP V chemotherapy. VII. Compare the feasibility, toxicity, and hematologic and&#xD;
      immunologic effects of post-PBSC infusion of IL-2/G-CSF vs. G-CSF alone. VIII. Assess the&#xD;
      response rate, duration of response, and disease free interval of patients with advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer treated with STAMP V with PBSC rescue. IX. Assess the presence of cytokeratin&#xD;
      as a marker of minimum residual disease when measured in blood and marrow by polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction during and following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for peripheral blood stem cell&#xD;
      stimulation (priming) and for therapy after stem cell transplantation. All patients receive&#xD;
      priming therapy with filgrastim (G-CSF) alone or with interleukin-2 (IL-2), then have stem&#xD;
      cells harvested. Patients with adequate harvest receive high dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa,&#xD;
      and carboplatin (STAMP V) followed by stem cell rescue with subsequent G-CSF with or without&#xD;
      IL-2, as follows: Arm I receives G-CSF alone for priming and following stem cell transplant.&#xD;
      Arm II receives G-CSF priming alone and G-CSF/IL-2 following transplant. Arm III receives&#xD;
      various doses of G-CSF/IL-2 priming and G-CSF following transplant. Arm IV receives various&#xD;
      levels of G-CSF/IL-2 priming and fixed doses of G-CSF/IL-2 following transplant. Cohorts of&#xD;
      3-6 patients each are treated on each treatment arm and at escalating doses of IL-2. The&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which less than 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for disease progression and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-24&#xD;
      months; a maximum of 12 patients will receive G-CSF priming alone (6 without and 6 with&#xD;
      post-PBSC IL-2).&#xD;
