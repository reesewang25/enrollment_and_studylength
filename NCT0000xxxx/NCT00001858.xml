  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol facilitates the development of methods for determining whether transplant&#xD;
      recipients have developed immune hyporesponsiveness or tolerance towards their allograft.&#xD;
      These methods will involve the study of peripheral blood or biopsy tissue obtained at regular&#xD;
      intervals from patients receiving kidney or combined kidney-pancreas allografts at the Warren&#xD;
      G. Magnuson Clinical Center. In addition, patients that have previously received a kidney or&#xD;
      combined kidney-pancreas allograft will be evaluated using assays requiring peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells and/or biopsies. Assays developed under this protocol will be used in&#xD;
      subsequent protocols to assess the effects of immune modulating treatment regimens and may&#xD;
      eventually be used to direct clinical care or guide the withdrawal of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agents. However, patients enrolled in this protocol will not have any change in treatment&#xD;
      based solely on the assays developed without being enrolled in an additional study.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates for a kidney or combined kidney-pancreas transplant performed at the National&#xD;
        Institutes of Health, or non-uremic healthy volunteers who are not on immunosuppressive&#xD;
        medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous recipients of kidney or combined kidney-pancreas transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recipients of kidney or combined kidney-pancreas transplants interested in participation in&#xD;
        the Recurrent Disease Allograft Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness and legal ability to give informed consent or permission from a legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to travel to the Clinical Center for protocol specific samples to be taken, or&#xD;
        in some cases, the ability to send samples via overnight mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For transplant patients, availability of donor tissue for testing. This could include&#xD;
        splenic or peripheral blood lymphocytes from a cadaveric donor or a willing living donor&#xD;
        enrolled on the Clinical Center Living Donor Protocol who consents to periodic phlebotomy&#xD;
        for peripheral blood lymphocyte isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability or unwillingness to comply with protocol monitoring and therapy, including, among&#xD;
        others, a history of noncompliance, circumstances where compliance with protocol&#xD;
        requirements is not feasible due to living conditions, travel restrictions, access to&#xD;
        urgent medical services, or access to anti-rejection drugs after the research protocol is&#xD;
        completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any active malignancy. Patients with primary, cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell cancers&#xD;
        may be enrolled providing these are appropriately eliminated prior to transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant coagulopathy or requirement for anticoagulation therapy that would&#xD;
        contraindicate protocol allograft biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelet count less than 100,000/mm(3).&#xD;
