  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergo chemotherapy until remission is obtained, or disease has been stable for two&#xD;
      cycles of chemotherapy, or progressive disease develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to six months after completion of chemotherapy, patients who have achieved complete&#xD;
      clinical remission or minimal disease status receive a series of 5 injections (given 1-2&#xD;
      months apart) of a vaccine consisting of 0.5 mg autologous tumor-derived immunoglobulin (Id)&#xD;
      conjugated to KLH. The vaccine is administered with subcutaneous QS-21 as an immunological&#xD;
      adjuvant....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The idiotype of the immunoglobulin on a given B cell malignancy (Id) can serve as a clonal&#xD;
      marker, and a previous pilot study in lymphoma patients has demonstrated that autologous Id&#xD;
      protein can be formulated into an immunogenic, tumor specific antigen by conjugation to a&#xD;
      carrier protein (KLH) and administration with an emulsion-based adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are: 1) to evaluate feasibility and toxicity of new vaccine&#xD;
      formulations, and 2) to evaluate cellular and humoral immune responses against the unique&#xD;
      idiotype of the patient's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to treat patients with follicular lymphomas to complete remission&#xD;
      or minimal residual disease with chemotherapy. Six to twelve months after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, in an effort to reduce the relapse rate (by eradicating microscopic disease&#xD;
      resistant to chemotherapy), patients will receive one of two new formulations of an&#xD;
      autologous Id vaccine.&#xD;
