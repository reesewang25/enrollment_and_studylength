      To compare the efficacy of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with percutaneous&#xD;
      transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in patients with multiple vessel coronary heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTCA is widely practiced as the procedure of choice for revascularization of the myocardium&#xD;
      in patients with single-vessel disease who are deemed to need intervention and is probably&#xD;
      more widely applied than surgery would be in the same group of patients. No study has shown&#xD;
      improved survival by intervention in such patients. The early natural history study by&#xD;
      Oberman showed survival experience of patients with single-vessel disease, including the&#xD;
      anterior descending, to resemble more closely patients with no coronary artery disease than&#xD;
      those with multivessel disease. Quality of life studies including the CASS randomized study,&#xD;
      which included 27 percent single-vessel disease patients, showed improved exercise tolerance&#xD;
      and less need for medication in patients who received PTCA For single-vessel disease. Balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty in single-vessel disease thus appears justified for the treatment of angina&#xD;
      pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In multivessel disease the CASS randomized trial has shown an improved survival at seven&#xD;
      years in the subset of patients with three-vessel disease and impaired ventricular function.&#xD;
      However, seven years may prove to be the point of widest separation between the medical and&#xD;
      surgical survival curves, based on the experience of the VA study which has presented results&#xD;
      to 11 years showing convergence of survival experience. Data from the Montreal Heart&#xD;
      Institute also indicate accelerated deterioration of venous grafts five to seven years after&#xD;
      surgery. The late failure of grafts is a potent argument for delaying CABG as long as&#xD;
      possible in the patients with multivessel disease. Should PTCA prove to be only a delaying&#xD;
      action in multivessel disease patients, a delay of several years until the first CABG&#xD;
      operation would confer an obvious advantage, even if repeat PTCA's were required. Repeat CABG&#xD;
      may carry an increased risk and presumably the possibility of inadequate revascularization as&#xD;
      autologous graft material is used up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As long as treatment for coronary artery disease is only palliative, management for the&#xD;
      individual patient requires a long-term (a lifetime) strategy, beginning with medical&#xD;
      management. PTCA could occupy an intermediate position in the time line of management of&#xD;
      multivessel disease patients if its relative efficiency in providing relief of ischemia and&#xD;
      ability to avoid or delay CABG were known. Most centers performing PTCA now have expanded the&#xD;
      indications for the procedure to patients with multivessel disease. However, its efficacy in&#xD;
      those patients has not been proven. Although data from the NHLBI PTCA Registry do include&#xD;
      patients with multivessel disease, most of those patients underwent only single PTCA&#xD;
      procedures even though they may have had stenoses in other vessels. Hence, a number of&#xD;
      questions must be raised concerning the usefulness of PTCA in patients with multivessel&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, single-center. A total of 198 patients were randomized to the PTCA group and 194&#xD;
      to the CABG group. As initial treatment, one patient in the CABG group underwent angioplasty&#xD;
      and two patients in the PTCA group underwent surgery, but the groups were followed according&#xD;
      to an intention-to-treat analysis. Randomization was performed on the basis of four&#xD;
      angiographic strata. Data were collected at baseline, and the patients were contacted every&#xD;
      six months for follow-up information. Coronary arteriography and thallium stress scanning&#xD;
      were performed at one and three years. All patients were followed for the duration of the&#xD;
      trial. Repeat angiographic studies were performed in 87 percent of the eligible patients at&#xD;
      one year and in 76 percent at three years. Thallium scans were obtained in 88 percent of the&#xD;
      patients at one year and in 77 percent at three years. The primary endpoint was a composite&#xD;
      of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction within the previous three years, and detection of a&#xD;
      large ischemic defect on thallium scanning at three years. Secondary endpoints involved the&#xD;
      degree of revascularization at one and three years, ventricular function, exercise&#xD;
      performance, the need for subsequent revascularization procedures, the quality of life, and&#xD;
      costs. All patients admitted to Emory University Hospital and Crawford Long Memorial Hospital&#xD;
      for cardiac catheterization, whether entered into the study or not, were entered into a study&#xD;
      registry as were patients who were referred for a revascularization procedure but who had&#xD;
      their initial catheterization performed elsewhere. Recruitment ended in April 1990. The trial&#xD;
      has been extended through August 1997 to allow a minimum of eight years and a maximum of ten&#xD;
      years of followup for the registry patients as well as for the main cohort of randomized&#xD;
      patients. Telephone contact is established annually with study participants in order to&#xD;
      determine rates of survival, rehospitalization, repeat revascularization procedures, and&#xD;
      functional status. The justification for the long-term followup is the evidence that CABG&#xD;
      begins to increase its failure rates between five and ten years.&#xD;
