  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give amprenavir (APV) to HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients. This study also examines the effect APV has on the level of HIV in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies have shown that APV is effective in slowing the growth of HIV in the body.&#xD;
      Patients who have failed previous anti-HIV treatment or who are unable to take other protease&#xD;
      inhibitors (PIs) may benefit from the availability of a new PI such as APV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Earlier Phase II/III clinical trials indicate APV is effective in retarding HIV progression&#xD;
      in the body. Despite these data, however, the drug has yet to receive regulatory approval. At&#xD;
      the same time, there is an urgent need to grant pre-approval access to specific groups of&#xD;
      patients eager to benefit from the anti-HIV potential inherent in APV. This study examines&#xD;
      the relative effects APV has in patients with prior treatment failure or intolerance to&#xD;
      previous protease inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are seen in the clinic at pre-entry, baseline (Day 1), and every 4 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
      Data on current antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 associated conditions and adverse events are&#xD;
      collected at every scheduled visit. Laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry,&#xD;
      plasma HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ cell count) are collected and assessed at pre-entry and&#xD;
      Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. Optimal therapeutic effectiveness dictates the combined use of 2 or&#xD;
      more antiretroviral agents in patients failing current antiretroviral therapy. APV,&#xD;
      therefore, must be initiated as a component of a treatment regimen that also includes at&#xD;
      least one other antiretroviral drug that the patient has not previously received.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of failure or intolerance (have experienced a treatment-limiting toxicity) to&#xD;
             standard protease inhibitor therapy and, in the judgment of the physician, be unable&#xD;
             to construct a viable treatment regimen without APV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent of parent or guardian if less than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction which might interfere&#xD;
             with drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical conditions such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             or other cardiac dysfunction, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             compromise the safety of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal failure requiring dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of clinically relevant pancreatitis or hepatitis within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with APV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently participating in, or who would qualify for or have access to, an&#xD;
             enrolling study of APV (ACTG 398 and ACTG 400).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk Behavior:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with current alcohol or illicit drug use which, in the investigator's opinion, may&#xD;
        interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Required:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently taking at least one nucleoside analogue or protease inhibitor, in addition to&#xD;
        amprenavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Required:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received prior treatment with one or more protease inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be naive to at least one or more nucleoside analogue, non-nucleoside&#xD;
             analogue, or protease inhibitor drugs.&#xD;
