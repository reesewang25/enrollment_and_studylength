    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and immunogenicity of vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope&#xD;
      glycoprotein (gp160) in asymptomatic HIV-infected adult volunteers. To compare safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of two different schedules of gp160 administration. To examine the effects of&#xD;
      gp160 and hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) on various markers of viral load and on selected&#xD;
      immune parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentiation of a patient's immune response to HIV might possibly prolong the period of&#xD;
      clinical latency and protect the patient indefinitely. Preliminary results from a study of&#xD;
      Immuno-AG recombinant gp160 vaccine in healthy volunteers not infected with HIV suggest that&#xD;
      the vaccine is safe and produces antibodies against the virus. Because another previous study&#xD;
      failed to demonstrate a specific anti-HIV response in patients injected with a recombinant&#xD;
      vaccinia virus containing HIV-1 genes, this study is also testing the immunotherapeutic role&#xD;
      of other immunizations (such as hepatitis B vaccination) that would be expected to induce a&#xD;
      nonspecific immune response in HIV-infected persons.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Fifty-five healthy HIV-positive volunteers are randomly assigned to one of the following&#xD;
      treatment arms: six injections (arm I) or four injections (arm II) of HIV-1 gp160 vaccine,&#xD;
      four injections of hepatitis B vaccine as a non-HIV viral vaccine control (arm III), or six&#xD;
      placebo injections consisting of the adjuvant vehicle used for the gp160 vaccine (arm IV).&#xD;
      Immunizations or placebo are given at 4-week intervals for 5 months. To maintain blinding,&#xD;
      adjuvant vehicle placebo is administered on days 84 and 112 to those volunteers receiving&#xD;
      four instead of six vaccine injections (arms II and III). Volunteers are followed at 4-month&#xD;
      intervals for 2 years.&#xD;
