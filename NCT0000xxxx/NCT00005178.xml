      In the first study, to identify children at high and low risk for cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      study their nutritional and physical activity behaviors as they relate to cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. In the second study, to make yearly assessments over a four year period of diet and&#xD;
      physical activity among children and their parents. The initial effort redefined and retested&#xD;
      methods to collect data on dietary intake and activity levels of young children.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past several decades, relationships between various lifestyle behaviors and the&#xD;
      development of cardiovascular risk factors have been identified. Nutritional status/eating&#xD;
      behaviors and physical activity patterns both directly and indirectly are related to the&#xD;
      development of coronary heart disease. For example, obesity, which may be a result of both&#xD;
      eating and physical activity behaviors, greatly increases the risk of hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, placing the individuals at greater risk for coronary&#xD;
      heart disease. Dietary factors such as composition in fatty acids and cholesterol,&#xD;
      composition in vegetable protein and complex carbohydrates, caloric excess and a high intake&#xD;
      of salt also are related to the development of risk of coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity in adults has also been correlated with coronary heart disease.&#xD;
      Epidemiological research has demonstrated that increased physical activity is associated with&#xD;
      reduced risk of myocardial infarctions. Regular physical exercise has been shown to have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on relative weight and obesity and may act indirectly to beneficially&#xD;
      affect hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and glucose intolerance and raise HDL cholesterol&#xD;
      levels. However, in 1985 when SCAN was initiated, little information was available concerning&#xD;
      the development of nutritional status/eating behaviors and routine physical activity patterns&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various psychosocial factors have been associated with increased risk of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. Among these factors are behavioral characteristics such as type A behaviors and&#xD;
      coping styles to stressors. However, relatively little was known in 1985 concerning the&#xD;
      development of such characteristics in children and when these characteristics became&#xD;
      associated with risk of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCAN initiated on the recommendations of the Preventive Cardiology Branch Task Force Group in&#xD;
      the Five Year Forward Plan 1982-1987, the Conference on School Health Education Research in&#xD;
      the Heart, Lung, and Blood Areas, and the Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory&#xD;
      Committee of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. A Request for Applications was&#xD;
      released in October 1984. In 1985, six grants were awarded as part of the Study of Children's&#xD;
      Activity and Nutrition (SCAN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were six projects supported by the SCAN program. They did not follow a common protocol&#xD;
      but were basically similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical College of Georgia: Five hundred and one Black and white children were followed over&#xD;
      a four year period for food intake behavior, physical activity and fitness, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, blood lipids and lipoproteins, heart rate and blood pressure, and psychologic&#xD;
      characteristics associated with coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      West Virginia University: Two hundred and eight predominantly white children of adults&#xD;
      followed since adolescence in the Bourbon County Study were members of this cohort. Children&#xD;
      participated in cardiovascular fitness tests, and underwent blood pressure measurements, and&#xD;
      serum lipid determinations. The effects of television-viewing, child-rearing patterns,&#xD;
      exercise, and nutrition-related knowledge and attitudes were assessed over a four year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Columbia University: Seven hundred and ninety-four primarily Hispanic children and their&#xD;
      parents were followed for four years to determine the extent to which diet and physical&#xD;
      activity predict coronary heart disease risk. Cross sectional and longitudinal analyses were&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Georgetown University: Five hundred and seventy Black children were followed for the&#xD;
      influence of the risk status of an older sibling and day care versus home care on nutrient&#xD;
      intake and physical activity. Eating events were videotaped, activity levels were recorded,&#xD;
      and measurements were obtained on height, weight, cholesterol, blood pressure, and skinfold&#xD;
      thickness. Dietary recalls and nutrition knowledge surveys were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of Massachusetts: In the Framingham Children's Study, one hundred children who&#xD;
      were direct descendents of Framingham Heart Study participants were followed for four years.&#xD;
      Measurements included height, weight, skinfold thickness, lipid profiles, heart rate and&#xD;
      activity monitoring, and assessment of dietary intake four times per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memphis State University: Six hundred and sixty-three children and their parents were&#xD;
      assessed for food intake, physical activity, and parent-child interactions related to food&#xD;
      intake and exercise. Anthropometric and cardiovascular data were also collected every four&#xD;
      months for four years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the studies were renewed in FY 1992 and again in FY 1996. See the Framingham&#xD;
      Children's Study and the Children's Activity and Nutrition III.&#xD;
