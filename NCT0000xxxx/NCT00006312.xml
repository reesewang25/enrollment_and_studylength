      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common inherited disorder among Caucasians with&#xD;
      an estimated frequency as high as 8 per 1000. Affected individuals absorb excessive amounts&#xD;
      of dietary iron and develop progressive accumulation of tissue iron stores with consequent&#xD;
      organ dysfunction including hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      arthropathy and impotence. Early diagnosis and institution of phlebotomy treatments will&#xD;
      prevent disease manifestations and normalize life expectancy. In 1996, HFE, the gene for HHC&#xD;
      was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3). HH is therefore a natural target for&#xD;
      the development of a routine screening strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have demonstrated the favorable cost-effectiveness ratio of adopting a&#xD;
      screening strategy for HH and have screened 16,031 primary care patients using serum&#xD;
      transferrin saturation (TS) levels to confirm the prevalence of undiagnosed HH in this&#xD;
      setting and to demonstrate the feasibility of screening. The recent description of HFE gene&#xD;
      mutations in individuals with HH has made genetic testing for HH possible and may increase&#xD;
      the attractiveness of general screening. However, several important questions about genetic&#xD;
      prevalence and penetrance remain to be addressed before such a recommendation can be made.&#xD;
      The large screened sample provides a unique opportunity to address several of these important&#xD;
      issues. First, they will obtain population-based estimates of the prevalence of HFE gene&#xD;
      mutations. Second, they will determine the sensitivity of serum TS testing for detecting&#xD;
      these mutations. Third, the comparison of genotype and phenotype will allow them to draw&#xD;
      useful inferences about disease penetrance. The results will enable them to propose an&#xD;
      optimal screening strategy for HH and to determine the place of genetic testing in the&#xD;
      diagnostic algorithm. This strategy may vary depending on age, sex and race. The answers to&#xD;
      these questions will enable them to determine with greater confidence the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness of a screening strategy for HH and will clarify for primary care practitioners&#xD;
      which of their patients should be screened for this disorder. These questions have recently&#xD;
      been identified as a priority by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the&#xD;
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.&#xD;
