  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether three different anti-HIV vaccines are safe&#xD;
      and whether they help prevent HIV infection. These vaccines are called vCP205, vCP1433, and&#xD;
      vCP1452. Some patients also receive another anti-HIV vaccine, gp160. The vaccines are made up&#xD;
      of small pieces of HIV, which help the body learn to recognize and destroy HIV. You cannot&#xD;
      get HIV from these vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two different ways a vaccine can protect the body from infection. First, a vaccine&#xD;
      may help the immune system make antibodies, which are proteins that recognize invading&#xD;
      viruses or bacteria. Second, a vaccine may help the body make immune cells that destroy&#xD;
      infected cells. The second type of vaccine is more powerful against HIV. In this study,&#xD;
      doctors will see whether vCP205, vCP1433, vCP1452, and gp160 are good vaccines by seeing&#xD;
      whether they help the body make immune cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies in humans have shown that immunization with certain vaccine combinations&#xD;
      (that is, ALVAC-HIV construct and an envelope subunit vaccine) can elicit CTL activity,&#xD;
      antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC), neutralizing antibodies, and other antibody&#xD;
      responses more often and at higher levels than either vaccine alone. This study examines&#xD;
      improved vaccine candidates that can elicit broader, longer-lasting CTL activity in the&#xD;
      majority of vaccine recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are randomized to one of four groups. Group I receives vCP205. Group II receives&#xD;
      vCP1433. Group III receives vCP1452. Group IV receives an ALVAC rabies vaccine, as a control.&#xD;
      Immunizations are administered at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6. At Months 3 and 6, patients in&#xD;
      Groups I, II, and III also receive gp160 MN/LAI-2, the subunit boost vaccine. Group IV&#xD;
      receives another placebo vaccine. Participants have regular clinic visits and blood is drawn&#xD;
      to determine humoral and cellular immune responses to the vaccines. [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      10/23/98: A cell-mediated immunity substudy has been added at selected institutions following&#xD;
      the fourth vaccination at 6 months; this study will assess the newer assays of CD8+ T cells&#xD;
      and the kinetic response following immunization. The 6-month immunization may be rescheduled&#xD;
      by up to 14 days to accommodate clinical, laboratory, or volunteer scheduling issues.] [AS&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 6/17/99: Three study arms are added. Group V receives vCP1452 at Months 0,1,3,&#xD;
      and 6. Group VI receives vCP205 at Months 0,1,3, and 6. Group VII receives placebo at Months&#xD;
      0,1,3, and 6. Patients in Groups V, VI, and VII do not receive the subunit boost, gp160&#xD;
      MN/LAI-2. Consenting volunteers enrolled in the three new groups at Johns Hopkins University&#xD;
      undergo PET scanning as part of an ancillary study.]&#xD;
