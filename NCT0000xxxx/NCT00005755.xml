      To examine the occupations, industries and exposures in the work-place which were associated&#xD;
      with a high risk for asthma and other adverse respiratory health effects, with particular&#xD;
      emphasis on specific exposures of predominantly female occupations (irritants, detergents and&#xD;
      other asthmagens), and of other high risk major occupations which had not been adequately&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory diseases are strongly related with exposure in the workplace. A considerable&#xD;
      proportion of adult onset asthma is associated with these exposures. The importance of&#xD;
      occupational risk factors for asthma has been underestimated, particularly among women. The&#xD;
      occupational asthma study (ECRHS-OA) forms part of a wider international multicentre survey&#xD;
      on respiratory health (European Community Respiratory Health Survey-ECRHS). The first phase&#xD;
      of the ECRHS was conducted in 1991/92 and examined risk factors for asthma and atopy in&#xD;
      subjects aged 20-44 years. The study updated (ECRHS-II), following-up approximately 17,000&#xD;
      young adults from 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway,&#xD;
      Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study provided valid and precise estimates on the importance of specific occupations,&#xD;
      industries and exposures in relation to asthma incidence and prevalence, similar estimates&#xD;
      for other respiratory symptoms and diseases and also for declines in pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal, community-based, multicenter study. Those subjects who took part in the first&#xD;
      occupational asthma study survey were re-contacted in 1999, to determine risk factors for&#xD;
      incidence and remission of asthma, other respiratory symptoms, atopy, changes in bronchial&#xD;
      responsiveness and lung function. Subjects were asked to perform a forced spirometry,&#xD;
      methacholine challenge and to provide blood samples for IgE testing. A questionnaire&#xD;
      administrated by trained interviewers was delivered requesting information on respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms and diseases, socio-demographic factors, tobacco smoking, complete occupational&#xD;
      history since the last survey, environmental exposures, family history, diet, treatment and&#xD;
      use of health services. Modular occupational questionnaires were developed for subjects&#xD;
      employed as cleaners, homemakers, welders, metal workers, nurses, and subjects exposed to&#xD;
      organic dusts in the paper and textile industries.&#xD;
