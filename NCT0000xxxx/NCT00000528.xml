      To determine if nonpharmacological interventions, including diet and lifestyle change, could&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High blood pressure affects between 15 and 30 percent of the adult population in the United&#xD;
      States, and is a major contributor to some of the leading causes of death including coronary&#xD;
      artery and cerebrovascular diseases. A substantial body of evidence from both population and&#xD;
      laboratory studies indicates that a number of dietary and lifestyle factors are associated&#xD;
      with the chronic and progressive increase in blood pressure with age, commonly observed in&#xD;
      populations of industrialized countries. There are also an increasing number of reports of&#xD;
      important reductions in blood pressure in persons with hypertension following treatment with&#xD;
      a number of different non-pharmacological interventions. These observations have led to&#xD;
      interest in the possibility of the primary prevention of hypertension through&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention on factors related to the development of high blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1979, the main results of the NHLBI-supported Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program&#xD;
      (HDFP), then the largest of the randomized clinical trials of antihypertensive drug&#xD;
      treatment, were reported. This trial compared the effects of intensive systematic&#xD;
      Stepped-Care drug treatment with Referred-Care in the community. These results confirmed&#xD;
      findings of earlier and subsequently reported placebo-controlled trials that effective&#xD;
      blood-pressure lowering in hypertensive individuals reduces the occurrence of stroke,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, and other complications of hypertension, and for the first time&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant reduction of total mortality. The implications of the findings&#xD;
      regarding recommendations for long-term drug treatment for tens of millions of Americans led&#xD;
      several groups of investigators to consider alternative approaches to the control of&#xD;
      hypertension. To the concerns of these clinicians about drug-related symptoms and economic&#xD;
      costs were added additional questions regarding the safety of common antihypertensive agents&#xD;
      in some hypertensive subgroups, based on the results of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention&#xD;
      Trial and on other evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of small to moderate-sized randomized clinical trials of non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      intervention in hypertension have been initiated during the past 5 years with NHLBI support.&#xD;
      The Hypertension Prevention Trial (HPT) was the largest program studying the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intervening in a non-hypertensive population. The HPT was a feasibility study to establish&#xD;
      the ability to enroll in sufficient numbers men and women with diastolic blood pressure of&#xD;
      78-89 mm Hg; to determine if dietary intervention alone could achieve sustained weight&#xD;
      reduction, and/or a decrease in sodium intake, or an increase in potassium intake along with&#xD;
      sodium reduction in these subjects; and to study the effects of the interventions on blood&#xD;
      pressure. If feasibility were demonstrated, the plan was to conduct a full-scale trial with&#xD;
      incidence of frank hypertension as the outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HPT achieved its feasibility goals regarding recruitment of participants and weight&#xD;
      reduction, but not for dietary sodium reduction and potassium increase. Some of the other&#xD;
      dietary trials among non-hypertensive subjects have also achieved relatively small sodium&#xD;
      changes (20-25 percent); a few have produced much larger changes, but only with short-term&#xD;
      follow-up. Other experience has also shown that it is difficult to increase potassium intake&#xD;
      by dietary means alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of further work in this area has meanwhile been reinforced by conclusions of&#xD;
      several expert groups convened by NHLBI. These have included the participants in the 1984 NIH&#xD;
      Workshop on Nutrition and Hypertension and the 1984 Joint National Committee on Detection,&#xD;
      Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, whose report addressed in some detail&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic intervention and primary prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I was a pilot study to test the feasibility of providing and obtaining compliance with&#xD;
      selected nutritional-behavioral, non-pharmacologic interventions and to measure the&#xD;
      short-term effectiveness of the interventions on reducing or preventing an increase in&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure. Ten clinical centers, and a coordinating center, which included two&#xD;
      central laboratories and a nutrient data center, participated. Each clinic tested a subset of&#xD;
      the interventions. The lifestyle arm of the trial, which included weight loss, sodium&#xD;
      restriction, and stress management, had an open design with untreated controls. The two-stage&#xD;
      supplement arm of the trial, which tested magnesium and calcium in Stage I, and fish oil and&#xD;
      potassium in Stage II, was double-blinded and placebo-controlled. Three clinics tested only&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions, two tested only supplements, and five participated in both arms of&#xD;
      the trial. Recruitment began in August 1987 and randomization was completed by October 1988.&#xD;
      Endpoint data collection was completed in January 1990. The average follow-up was&#xD;
      approximately 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II had a 2x2 factorial design to test the effectiveness of weight loss and sodium&#xD;
      restriction alone and in combination in reducing blood pressure and decreasing the incidence&#xD;
      of definite hypertension. Lifestyle interventions were administered through counseling&#xD;
      sessions at each center. Blood pressure, weight, body mass index, skin fold thickness, and&#xD;
      urine electrolytes were measured at baseline and at six month intervals for a minimum of 36&#xD;
      months. Recruitment began at the end of 1990 and was completed in March 1992. Intervention&#xD;
      and follow-up were completed in March 1995. Data analysis continued through June 1998 under&#xD;
      U01-HL-37852, the coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main results were presented at the 1995 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions.&#xD;
      The Phase II main results paper was published in March 1997.&#xD;
