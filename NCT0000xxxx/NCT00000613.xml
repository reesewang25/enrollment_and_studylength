      To determine the acceptability and benefits of use of a dietary supplement of the&#xD;
      phytoestrogen, genistein, versus placebo on heart disease risk factors, bone density, and&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes in postmenopausal women.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogen replacement therapy is beneficial for heart disease risk factors as well as for bone&#xD;
      density. However, a large proportion of postmenopausal women are not compliant with&#xD;
      therapeutic regimens. Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring compounds found in plants and&#xD;
      soy products that have estrogenic effects, and may represent an alternative treatment for the&#xD;
      prevention of heart disease and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, few&#xD;
      intervention trials have examined the extent to which it is possible to improve heart disease&#xD;
      risk factors, bone density, and quality of life in postmenopausal women through use of a&#xD;
      dietary supplement of phytoestrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 210 women were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study to be followed for one to two years. The women were randomized to phytoestrogen&#xD;
      treatment or to placebo. Data are collected at baseline visits, at one and three month&#xD;
      follow-up telephone calls, and at 6, 12, and 24 month follow-up clinic visits. Measures of&#xD;
      high density lipoprotein and other heart disease risk factors, hip and spine bone density,&#xD;
      and depression, life satisfaction, and quality of well-being are obtained. Cross-sectional&#xD;
      and longitudinal comparisons of treatment and placebo groups are performed before and after&#xD;
      adjustment and stratification for potentially confounding covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in March 2002 to assess whether the women treated with phytoestrogens&#xD;
      had lowered homocysteine, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, E-selectin, and decreased&#xD;
      obesity and fat mass over two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
