    <textblock>
      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal daunorubicin and SU5416 in treating&#xD;
      patients who have hematologic cancer that has not responded to initial therapy. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. SU5416 may stop the growth of hematologic cancer by stopping blood flow to the cancer&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SU5416 when administered with daunorubicin&#xD;
      liposomal in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, refractory anemia with excess blasts&#xD;
      (RAEB), RAEB in transformation, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia not in complete remission&#xD;
      21-50 days after one course of induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the qualitative&#xD;
      and quantitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of SU5416.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive daunorubicin liposomal IV over 6 hours on days 1-3 and SU5416 IV twice a&#xD;
      week for 2 months. The second course is administered for 1 month, then treatment continues&#xD;
      every 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose limiting toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.&#xD;

             more than 1 prior course of chemotherapy prior to study entry; this must contain Ara-C&#xD;
             at a dose of at least 1 g/m^2 daily x 4 days and either topotecan or an anthracycline&#xD;
             at standard doses (i.e., daunorubicin =&lt; 65 mg/m^2 daily x 3 days, or idarubicin 12&#xD;
             mg/m^2 daily x 3 days); patients beginning liposomal Daunorubicin on days 21 to 42 of&#xD;
