      BACKGROUND: A number of important scientific advances can be made through the study of blood,&#xD;
      bone marrow, tumor, or other tissue samples from patients with HIV infection, infection with&#xD;
      Kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), infection with other oncogenic viruses, or&#xD;
      cancer. This protocol provides a mechanism to effect a variety of such studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: Acquisition of serum, circulating cells, bone marrow, and tumor or normal tissue&#xD;
      samples from patients with HIV infection, KSHV infection, or with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY: Eligibility criteria include age 18 years or older and at lest one of the&#xD;
      following: Exposure risk to HIV, KSHV, or HPV; HIV seropositive; KSHV seropositive; EBV&#xD;
      seropositive; HTLV-1 seropositive; malignancy, Castleman s disease, or skin lesions with&#xD;
      appearance of Kaposi s sarcoma; or cervical or anal intraepithelial lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Blood samples may be collected at the initial visit, and at follow-up visits. Tumor&#xD;
      samples may be obtained by fine needle aspirate, by removal of pleural or peritoneal fluid,&#xD;
      by skin punch biopsy, or by excisional biopsy, providing the tumor is accessible with minimal&#xD;
      risk to the patients. Specific risks will be described in a separate consent to be obtained&#xD;
      at the time of the biopsy. Samples will be studied in the HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch,&#xD;
      CCR, NCI; laboratories in NCI-Frederick; or those of collaborating investigators.&#xD;

      sarcoma; or cervical or anal intraepithelial lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 999 subjects will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples may be collected at the initial visit, and at follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other fluids/excretions may be collected (such as urine, saliva, semen, and stool).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor samples may be obtained by fine needle aspirate, by removal of pleural or peritoneal&#xD;
      fluid, by skin punch biopsy, or by excisional biopsy, providing the tumor is accessible with&#xD;
      minimal risk to the patients.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure risk to HIV, KSHV, or HPV&#xD;
&#xD;

        NOTE: infection with HIV, KSHV, EBV, and HTLV-1 are life-long, so if patients have&#xD;
        previously been seropositive or have had a disease associated with KSHV (KS, primary&#xD;
        effusion lymphoma [PEL], or KSHV-multicentric Castleman s disease), this is sufficient to&#xD;
        meet this criterion for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document. Participants could have a witness signature if they are either blind&#xD;
             or illiterate, etc.&#xD;
