    <textblock>
      To develop and evaluate a computer assisted instruction (CAI) weight management program in an&#xD;
      adult population with low literacy at Sheehan Memorial Hospital's Family Care Center (FCC),&#xD;
      an outpatient clinic serving the inner city of Buffalo, New York.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was the first study in patient care informatics in which nutrient analysis methodology&#xD;
      was used on a day-to-day basis to motivate low literate individuals to improve their food&#xD;
      choice behavior and physical activity. The deliverables of this investigation included&#xD;
      revised and enhanced software, professional documentation, and a participant workbook. These&#xD;
      materials were designed so that they could be integrated into any risk factor reduction&#xD;
      program for low literacy populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAI featured voice recognition, giant cursor movement, and a graphics-based environment&#xD;
      using pictures to facilitate an exceptionally easy to use and understand software program and&#xD;
      booklet. The voice recognition technology was linked with compact disk read only memory (CD&#xD;
      ROM) to visually display food choices and physical activities for ease of recording data by&#xD;
      the individual. The software was formatted so that health professionals could select&#xD;
      preference levels which corresponded to the motivational level of the individual. The&#xD;
      four-session CAI intervention had two planned maintenance sessions. The output was&#xD;
      personalized and in color. It was designed to identify problematic foods in the diet, improve&#xD;
      food selections, and increase physical activity. Stars were printed for adherence to&#xD;
      individual goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and fifty (150) men and 150 women, between age 20 and age 44, with a reading&#xD;
      level of 8th grade or less, who were between 20 percent and 40 percent over their ideal body&#xD;
      weight, were randomly assigned to three groups. The design compared a control group without&#xD;
      the intervention, a group experiencing the CAI intervention and hands-on computer use, and a&#xD;
      group experiencing the intervention but not the CAI component or computer use. All groups&#xD;
      were pretested, posttested, and follow-up tested at six months and twelve months following&#xD;
      baseline. The primary outcome measures were weight loss, nutrient intake, and physical&#xD;
      activity. Data were analyzed using a two-way analysis of covariance and appropriate t-tests.&#xD;
