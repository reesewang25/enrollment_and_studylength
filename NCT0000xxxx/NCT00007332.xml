  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the vaccines tested are safe when given alone and when&#xD;
      given together, and how the immune system responds to the vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines are given to people to try to prevent an infection or disease. Early testing in a&#xD;
      few people has shown that the HIV vaccines ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/B seem to be safe to&#xD;
      use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no cure for HIV infection or AIDS, and drug therapy is too expensive for most&#xD;
      affected populations. For this reason, the development of safe, effective vaccines to prevent&#xD;
      HIV infections worldwide is needed. ALVAC vCP1452 and MN rgp120/HIV-1 have been shown to be&#xD;
      well tolerated in Phase I and II studies. ALVAC vCP1452 given alone or in combination with&#xD;
      subunit antigens [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: antigen] is a candidate vaccine to be evaluated&#xD;
      for the ability to produce and express vaccine antigen in greater quantity for a longer time&#xD;
      and with improved immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are randomized to 1 of 7 [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: 1 of 4] groups and stratified&#xD;
      by risk status. Prior to immunization, evaluations and blood draws are done to monitor&#xD;
      hematological, chemical, and immunologic parameters. Volunteers receive 2 injections of the&#xD;
      following vaccines at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: ALVAC vCP1452 and alum placebo [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: AIDSVAX placebo (aluminum&#xD;
      hydroxide adjuvant)] at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: ALVAC vCP1452 and alum placebo [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: AIDSVAX placebo] at&#xD;
      Months 0 and 1 and ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/B at Months 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: ALVAC placebo and alum placebo. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: ALVAC vCP1452 and&#xD;
      AIDSVAX B/B at Months 0, 1, and 6 and ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX placebo at Month 3.] Group D:&#xD;
      ALVAC vCP1452 and alum placebo at Months 0 and 1 and ALVAC vCP1452 and MN rgp120 at Months 3&#xD;
      and 6. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: ALVAC placebo and AIDSVAX placebo at Months 0, 1, 3, and&#xD;
      6.] Group E: ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/B at Months 0, 1, and 6; ALVAC vCP1452 and alum&#xD;
      placebo at Month 3. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Group E has been discontinued.] Group F:&#xD;
      ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/B. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Group F has been discontinued.]&#xD;
      Group G: ALVAC vCP1452 and alum placebo at Months 0 and 1; ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/E at&#xD;
      Months 3 and 6. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Group G has been discontinued.] Following each&#xD;
      pair of injections, volunteers are observed in the clinic for 30 minutes. Volunteers keep a&#xD;
      record of body temperature and any other symptoms and report results to their AIDS Vaccine&#xD;
      Evaluation Unit. Evaluations are performed by telephone or clinic visit on Days 1 and 2 after&#xD;
      each vaccination. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Volunteers record all relevant signs and&#xD;
      symptoms occurring 48 hours after each vaccination and provide that information at each&#xD;
      clinic visit.] HIV testing is conducted every 3 to 6 months and volunteers are asked to&#xD;
      complete social harms questionnaires once at Day 168 and once at the end of the study.&#xD;
      Volunteers are followed on the study for a minimum of 18 months after the first immunization.&#xD;
      Safety is evaluated by closely monitoring for local and systemic adverse reactions during the&#xD;
      course of the trial.&#xD;
