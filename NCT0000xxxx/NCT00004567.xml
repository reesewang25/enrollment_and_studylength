  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of two drugs-methotrexate and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MPM)-in preventing disease recurrence in patients with Wegener's&#xD;
      granulomatosis and related inflammatory blood vessel disorders. The standard treatment for&#xD;
      these conditions is combination drug therapy with prednisone plus cyclophosphamide. However,&#xD;
      although most patients improve on this therapy and achieve disease remission, many experience&#xD;
      a relapse (return of the disease) some time after therapy is stopped. Also, these drugs can&#xD;
      produce serious side effects during treatment. This study will test a new treatment regimen&#xD;
      to try to maintain disease remission in these patients with minimal side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis or other related blood vessel disorders between 10 and&#xD;
      80 years old will be considered for this study. All participants will start therapy with&#xD;
      daily doses of prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Prednisone will be reduced gradually and then&#xD;
      stopped after symptoms improve significantly. Cyclophosphamide will continue until the&#xD;
      disease is in remission. Patients in remission will then be randomly assigned to continue&#xD;
      treatment with either MPM or methotrexate. MPM is taken twice a day by mouth. Methotrexate is&#xD;
      taken once a week, usually by mouth, but in some cases, by injection into a muscle or under&#xD;
      the skin. Patients who do well and have no side effects will continue treatment for 2 years.&#xD;
      Then, the drug will gradually be reduced (usually at monthly intervals) and finally stopped.&#xD;
      No further treatment will be given unless a relapse occurs. At that time, the type of&#xD;
      treatment will depend on various medical factors, including the severity of the recurrence&#xD;
      and the patient's history of drug side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examinations and various tests, including blood and urine analyses, and X-rays, will&#xD;
      be done periodically to evaluate the response to treatment and monitor drug side effects. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study-from the screening evaluation through a 2-year follow up after&#xD;
      all medications have been stopped-is about 5 to 6 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the comparative efficacy of using methotrexate versus&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil for maintaining remission that has been induced by cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      glucocorticoids in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and related vasculitides. In this&#xD;
      study, all patients will initially receive daily cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids and&#xD;
      then at disease remission, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued and patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil for remission maintenance.&#xD;
      They will continue to receive the agent to which they are randomized for 2 years, after which&#xD;
      time it will be tapered and discontinued. Patients will be prospectively monitored for&#xD;
      evidence of disease relapse and drug toxicity. Specific parameters that will be obtained&#xD;
      include the time to disease remission, the rate and time of disease relapse, and the&#xD;
      incidence of drug-related adverse events.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Documentation of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) or a related systemic vasculitis based&#xD;
             on clinical characteristics and histopathologic and/or angiographic evidence of&#xD;
             vasculitis. In the absence of histopathologic and/or angiographic evidence of&#xD;
             vasculitis, patients who meet one of the following criteria and in whom infectious and&#xD;
             autoimmune diseases that may mimic WG or a related systemic vasculitides have been&#xD;
             excluded will also be eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. A positive assay for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (C- or P-ANCA) and&#xD;
             the presence of glomerulonephritis defined by red blood cell casts and proteinuria or&#xD;
             renal biopsy showing necrotizing glomerulonephritis in the absence of immune deposits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             B. A positive assay for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (C- or P-ANCA) and&#xD;
             the presence of granulomatous inflammation on biopsy plus abnormal chest radiograph&#xD;
             (defined as the presence of nodules, fixed infiltrates, or cavities) plus nasal/oral&#xD;
             inflammation on clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 10-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of active disease as defined by a Vasculitis Disease Activity Index of&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 3 or if begun on CYC and glucocorticoid at an outside&#xD;
             institution, a history of a Vasculitis Disease Activity Index greater than or equal to&#xD;
             3 at the time of therapy initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of active infection which, in the judgment of the investigator, is of greater&#xD;
             danger to the patient than the underlying vasculitis. In those instances in which&#xD;
             infection cannot be ruled out by gram stain and culture of secretions or collections&#xD;
             of fluid in involved organs, it may be necessary to obtain a biopsy of the affected&#xD;
             tissue for microbiological and histopathological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are pregnant or who are nursing infants will not be eligible. Fertile&#xD;
             women must have a negative pregnancy test within one week prior to study entry and&#xD;
             must be using an effective means of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Serological evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, or a&#xD;
             positive hepatitis B surface antigen. A serological determination will be performed&#xD;
             within two weeks of beginning study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Acute or chronic liver disease, past history of alcohol abuse (greater than 14 oz of&#xD;
             100 proof liquor or equivalent per week), ongoing alcohol use of any volume that&#xD;
             cannot be discontinued upon entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of CYC- or methotrexate- induced pneumonitis with past treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hypersensitivity to CYC, MPM, or methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to comply with study guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Hemocytopenia: platelet count less than 80,000/mm(3), leukocyte count less than&#xD;
             3,000/mm(3), hematocrit less than 20% (in the absence of gastrointestinal bleeding or&#xD;
             hemolytic anemia).&#xD;
