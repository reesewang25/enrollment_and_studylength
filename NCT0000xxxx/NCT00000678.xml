  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effectiveness of zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine; ddC ) therapy to zidovudine (&#xD;
      AZT ) in the treatment of AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex ( ARC ) in patients who have&#xD;
      already received at least 1 year of AZT therapy and to define the safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ddC has been shown to have an antiviral effect, and AZT is known to significantly decrease&#xD;
      mortality and to reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS or&#xD;
      advanced ARC. After 1 year of AZT therapy, the effectiveness tends to diminish and patients&#xD;
      progress with more opportunistic infections and higher mortality rates. This may be due to&#xD;
      the emergence of AZT resistant virus isolated from some patients who have been on long-term&#xD;
      AZT therapy. These isolates were still sensitive to ddC. A study of long-term effectiveness&#xD;
      of ddC in patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who have been on long-term AZT therapy is&#xD;
      warranted because (1) ddC has antiviral activity, (2) there is no blood toxicity associated&#xD;
      with taking ddC, and (3) the effectiveness of ddC in test tube studies does not seem to be&#xD;
      diminished by decreased effectiveness of AZT.&#xD;

      ddC has been shown to have an antiviral effect, and AZT is known to significantly decrease&#xD;
      mortality and to reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS or&#xD;
      advanced ARC. After 1 year of AZT therapy, the effectiveness tends to diminish and patients&#xD;
      progress with more opportunistic infections and higher mortality rates. This may be due to&#xD;
      the emergence of AZT resistant virus isolated from some patients who have been on long-term&#xD;
      AZT therapy. These isolates were still sensitive to ddC. A study of long-term effectiveness&#xD;

      with taking ddC, and (3) the effectiveness of ddC in test tube studies does not seem to be&#xD;
      diminished by decreased effectiveness of AZT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: AZT will be administered orally every 4 or 5 hours. Patients in the second arm&#xD;
      discontinue AZT and take ddC as two tablets every 8 hours. Duration of the study is 1 year&#xD;
      with interim analysis done at 6 months after 75 percent enrollment and at end of the study.&#xD;
      Original design: Patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who have been receiving at least 500&#xD;
      mg/day of AZT for at least 48 weeks are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients in the&#xD;
      first treatment arm continue their current dose of AZT.&#xD;
