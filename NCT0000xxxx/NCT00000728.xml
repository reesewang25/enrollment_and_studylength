  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the short-term effects of administering zidovudine ( AZT ) at the same time with&#xD;
      increasing doses of aldesleukin ( interleukin-2; IL-2 ) in patients with persistent&#xD;
      generalized lymphadenopathy syndrome ( PGL ). The effects to be studied include safety or&#xD;
      toxicity, how quickly the drugs are used in the body, effects on the immune system, effects&#xD;
      on HIV, concentrations in body fluids, and how quickly the drugs are cleared by the kidneys.&#xD;
      The trial will establish the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and will be a pilot study to&#xD;
      determine the dose that has the greatest effect in the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZT has been shown to be effective in HIV-related disease. IL-2 has been shown to increase&#xD;
      immune responses and correct immune problems caused by HIV in the test tube. IL-2 has also&#xD;
      been effective in treating Kaposi's sarcoma in a number of patients. Because of the clinical&#xD;
      activities of these two drugs and because their toxicities and mechanisms of action do not&#xD;
      overlap, it may be beneficial to combine the two drugs with their antiviral and immune&#xD;
      stimulatory effects.&#xD;

      AZT has been shown to be effective in HIV-related disease. IL-2 has been shown to increase&#xD;
      immune responses and correct immune problems caused by HIV in the test tube. IL-2 has also&#xD;
      been effective in treating Kaposi's sarcoma in a number of patients. Because of the clinical&#xD;
      activities of these two drugs and because their toxicities and mechanisms of action do not&#xD;
      overlap, it may be beneficial to combine the two drugs with their antiviral and immune&#xD;
      stimulatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enter the study in staggered groups of five. All patients receive AZT orally every 4&#xD;
      hours for 12 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, the first group of five patients receive the&#xD;
      lowest dosage of IL-2 on a daily basis while still receiving AZT. Toxicity and immunologic&#xD;
      effects are measured at the beginning of AZT therapy and then every 2 weeks. Each succeeding&#xD;
      group of five patients receives a higher dose of IL-2, while receiving AZT, until the MTD is&#xD;
      reached. Those patients who have shown no toxicity as well as improved immune function while&#xD;
      taking both drugs receive a 4-week follow-up course of IL-2 5 weeks after stopping AZT. In&#xD;
      addition, five patients who have completed the AZT / IL-2 combined treatment without&#xD;
      significant toxicity are re-treated with 12 weeks of AZT alone starting 8 weeks after&#xD;
      completing the initial combined AZT / IL-2 portion of treatment. Another five patients will&#xD;
      be re-treated with 12 weeks of full dose of AZT alone, followed by 8 weeks of half-dose AZT&#xD;
      alone starting 8 weeks after completing the initial combined AZT / IL-2 treatment. Patients&#xD;
      receive ibuprofen for fever and chills, and those who reach their MTD continue to receive&#xD;
      that dose in combination with AZT for 4 weeks. If excess toxicity is observed on all doses of&#xD;
      IL-2, the study will be discontinued.&#xD;
