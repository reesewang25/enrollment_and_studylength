    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1 are a significant cause of morbidity but little&#xD;
      is known about the natural history of these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of this study is to monitor the natural history of plexiform neurofibromas&#xD;
           and to evaluate the usefulness of volumetric MRI tumor measurements in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other goals of the study are to provide a body of normative data on the growth rate of&#xD;
           plexiform neurofibromas and to establish a tissue repository and pathology review center&#xD;
           to allow future studies of the pathogenesis of neurofibromas and clinical trials of&#xD;
           potential therapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This study is coordinated by Dr. Bruce Korf, and was initiated when he was at the Partners&#xD;
      Center for Human Genetics, Boston, MA.&#xD;

        A total of 300 plexiform neurofibromas will be studied, consisting of 100 tumors in the&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis: All study subjects will fulfill two or more of the&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria listed below for NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Six or more caf(SqrRoot)(Copyright)-au-lait macules&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  1.5cm or larger in postpubertal individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  0.5 cm or larger in prepubertal individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two or more neurofibromas of any type or 1 or more plexiform neurofibroma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Freckling in the axilla or groin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Optic glioma (tumor of the optic pathway)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two or more Lisch nodules (benign iris hamartomas)&#xD;

             NF1 that is causing, or has potential to cause, disfigurement or functional&#xD;
             disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Distribution of Plexiform Neurofibromas by site: A total of 300 plexiform&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Trunk and Limbs (internal) [spinal plexiform neurofibromas involve two or more&#xD;
                  levels with connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject Ascertainment: Study subjects will be ascertained at any of the participating&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

             tolerate MRI studies or anesthesia (if needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to image tumor or define tumor margins by MRI (which may be determined after&#xD;
             the initial study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to obtain initial MRI within 60 days of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation therapy to site of plexiform neurofibroma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery involving the plexiform neurofibroma (excluding biopsy) within a six month&#xD;
             period before enrollment&#xD;
