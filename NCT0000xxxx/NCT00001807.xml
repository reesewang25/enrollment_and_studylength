    <textblock>
      Central nervous system toxicity is a recognized side effect of certain therapies for cancers,&#xD;
      particularly cranial irradiation, intrathecal therapy or systemic high-dose chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical manifestations vary. Previous studies defining MRI&#xD;
      changes and correlating these with neurocognitive deficiencies have been inconsistent. Recent&#xD;
      advances in brain imaging may help to better define neurotoxic effects. (1)H-NMRS is a&#xD;
      noninvasive method of obtaining in vivo biochemical information from the brain. It has been&#xD;
      used to study patients with CNS disorders, including neuronal disorders. In this study,&#xD;
      (1)H-NMRS will be used to objectively characterize CNS toxicities in patients with cancer who&#xD;
      are receiving potentially neurotoxic therapies. In addition, we will retrospectively evaluate&#xD;
      patients with known or suspected neurotoxicity associated with cancer therapy, to determine&#xD;
      if changes in spectroscopic patterns are associated with CNS toxicity.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central nervous system toxicity is a recognized side effect of certain cancer therapies,&#xD;
           particularly cranial irradiation, intrathecal therapy and systemic high-dose&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pathophysiologic mechanisms are not well-defined and clinical manifestations vary.&#xD;
           Previous studies defining MRI changes and correlating these with neurocognitive&#xD;
           deficiencies have been inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent advances in brain imaging may help to better define neurotoxic effects. (1)H-NMRS&#xD;
           is a noninvasive method of obtaining in vivo biochemical information from the brain. It&#xD;
           has been used to study patients with CNS disorders, including neuronal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To identify specific patterns of brain metabolites that are associated with therapy-related&#xD;
      neurotoxicity using (1)H-NMRS in cancer patients who are receiving or have received&#xD;
      potentially neurotoxic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with brain tumors or patients receiving high-dose systemic chemotherapy,&#xD;
      intrathecal chemotherapy (lumbar puncture or intra-Ommaya), or cranial radiation therapy OR&#xD;
      patients with documented or suspected clinical neurotoxicity presumed to be caused by&#xD;
      treatment for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to identify metabolite profiles that may be associated with neurotoxicity, NMRS&#xD;
           data will be collected in a cross-sectional manner from patients at various stages of&#xD;
           treatment and longitudinally throughout the course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NMRS studies will be performed on patients entered on this study at any or all of the&#xD;
           following times: prior to therapy, immediately after the first cycle of therapy, prior&#xD;
           to subsequent cycles of therapy, or after completion of all therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurotoxicity will also be evaluated by neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
