      To evaluate the anti-HIV effect of single agent versus combination therapy with zidovudine&#xD;
      (AZT) and interferon alfa-2a (IFN-A2a), as measured by p24 protein expression, viral growth&#xD;
      and infectivity in patients with symptomatic HIV disease. To assess the safety of low dose&#xD;
      schedules of AZT and IFN-A2a, alone and in combination, as measured by neutrophil counts and&#xD;
      hepatic transaminase levels. To evaluate the comparative effects of single agent versus&#xD;
      combination therapy with AZT and IFN-A2a on CD4 cell counts and skin test reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZT is known to be an effective treatment for HIV infection. However, patients may develop&#xD;
      reactions to AZT when it is administered for long periods of time. Combining AZT with another&#xD;
      drug at lower doses might reduce toxicity in patients and prevent the development of drug&#xD;
      resistant strains. IFN-A2a can reduce the growth of HIV in test tube experiments and recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that when AZT and IFN-A2a are used together they reduce the growth of HIV&#xD;
      more effectively than when either drug is used alone. This study will examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of these drugs when they are given together and compare these&#xD;
      results with the effectiveness and safety of the drugs when they are used alone.&#xD;

      effectiveness and safety of these drugs when they are given together and compare these&#xD;
      results with the effectiveness and safety of the drugs when they are used alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: 04-18-91 Treatment extended to 96 weeks. Patients are seen weekly for the first&#xD;
      month and for the month following initiation of combination therapy (Cohorts 1, 2), then&#xD;
      every other week until treatment week 48, followed by every week for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. AMENDED: The doses have been modified to one of 4 total daily doses of AZT and one of&#xD;
      4 daily doses of IFN-A2a. AMENDED: Total treatment period will be 48 weeks. AMENDED: 9-24-90&#xD;
      Treatment will end 901214. Original Design: Before beginning any treatment, patients are&#xD;
      carefully examined and evaluated. Each patient receives medication for 24 weeks, followed by&#xD;
      a 4-week follow-up period. Patients are assigned randomly to one of four dosing schedules&#xD;
      within one of three groups stratified according to whether or not they have ever received AZT&#xD;
      and / or IFN-A2a:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 receives AZT alone for 12 weeks, then AZT plus IFN-A2a for the following 12&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 receives IFN-A2a alone for 12 weeks, then IFN-A2a plus AZT for the following 12&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 receives the combination of AZT and IFN-A2a for 24 weeks. Medications are&#xD;
           administered according to one of four possible daily dosing schedules of AZT plus&#xD;
           IFN-A2a (increasing doses of each). AZT is taken by mouth as a capsule every 6 hours.&#xD;
           IFN-A2a is given by an injection under the skin once a day. Initially, doses of IFN-A2a&#xD;
           are given by one of the research staff, after which patients are taught to give their&#xD;
           own injections. Patients are examined weekly for the first 4 weeks, then every other&#xD;
           week until the end of the study. Patients assigned to groups receiving two drugs will be&#xD;
           examined weekly again for 4 weeks when the second drug is added.&#xD;
