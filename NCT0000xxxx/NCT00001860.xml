  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Sandostatin LAR速 (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark) Depot to transsphenoidal surgery in previously untreated acromegalic patients with&#xD;
      macroadenomas. The primary goal is to normalize insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels.&#xD;
      Secondary goals are to compare Sandostatin LAR速 (Registered Trademark) Depot treatment and&#xD;
      transsphenoidal surgery to achieve the following goals: suppress growth hormone levels to&#xD;
      less than or equal to 2.5 ng/mL, relieve the clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly,&#xD;
      reduce the size of the macroadenomas, produce few side effects, assess the prognostic value&#xD;
      of baseline pituitary adenoma size, extension and baseline growth hormone level on&#xD;
      post-treatment growth hormone and IGF-1 levels, and assess the resource utilization of each&#xD;
      treatment type.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male or female patients, 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Newly diagnosed patients with acromegaly, or previously untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of a pituitary tumor greater than 10 mm at greatest diameter (macroadenoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lack of suppression of GH to less than 2.0 ng/mL using a regular GH RIA, or less than one&#xD;
        ng/mL using a two-site immunoradiometric or chemiluminescent GH assay, after oral&#xD;
        administration of 100 g of glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        IGF-1 levels above the upper limits of normal (adjusted for age and gender).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Demonstrated tolerance to a test dose of s.c. Sandostatin Injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Demonstrated responsiveness to a 100 ug s.c. Sandostatin Injection test dose, as evidenced&#xD;
        by suppression of mean 4HR GH to less than 5 ng/mL, or to greater than 50 % of the baseline&#xD;
        value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients demonstrating intolerance to a s.c. Sandostatin (octreotide acetate) test dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received any prior treatment for their acromegaly, including&#xD;
        radiotherapy, octreotide, bromocriptine, lanreotide, or prior surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients who are pregnant or lactating, or are of childbearing potential and not&#xD;
        practicing a medically acceptable method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with compression of the optic chiasm significant enough to cause visual field&#xD;
        defects on automated testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who require surgery for relief of any neurologic signs or symptoms associated with&#xD;
        their tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III and IV), unstable angina,&#xD;
        sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or a history of acute&#xD;
        myocardial infarction within the three months preceding study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;

        or Sponsor's Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
