      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of 3-AP in treating patients who have&#xD;
      advanced cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, tolerability, and toxicity of 3-AP in patients with&#xD;
      advanced malignancies. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      of this treatment in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this&#xD;
      treatment in these patients. IV. Determine the tumor response in these patients treated with&#xD;
      this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive 3-AP IV continuously&#xD;
      over 96 hours. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response receive treatment for 1 course past&#xD;
      the course in which the complete response was documented; patients with partial response may&#xD;
      receive treatment for up to 1 year; and patients with stable disease may receive treatment&#xD;
      for up to 6 months. During the accelerated phase of the study, cohorts of 1 patient each&#xD;
      receive escalating doses of 3-AP until one patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      or 2 different patients experience grade 2 toxicity during any course. When the accelerated&#xD;
      phase ends, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
