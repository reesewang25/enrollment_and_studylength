      To test the hypothesis that correction with bifocal spectacle lenses rather than&#xD;
      single-vision lenses will slow the progression of myopia in children with near-point&#xD;
      esophoria. The primary outcome variable is cycloplegic refraction as measured with an&#xD;
      automated refractor. Axial length is measured with ultrasound in order to test the corollary&#xD;
      hypothesis that use of bifocals will slow ocular growth in these myopic children. We will&#xD;
      also examine the amount of close work performed by subjects and the degree of parental myopia&#xD;
      as factors that may influence myopia progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 25 percent of all persons in the United States are myopic. The most common form of&#xD;
      myopia is childhood myopia, which begins after age 6 and progresses rapidly until age 16.&#xD;
      Myopia progression results from excessive growth of the eye, primarily by enlargement of the&#xD;
      vitreous chamber. Excessive elongation of the eye is a major risk factor for retinal&#xD;
      detachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous prospective studies failed to show that use of bifocals was effective in slowing&#xD;
      myopia progression. However, these studies did not separate subjects by near-point phoria&#xD;
      before randomization. Retrospective studies by David Goss indicated that bifocals slowed&#xD;
      myopia progression by almost 50 percent in children with near-point esophoria but had no&#xD;
      effect on children with exophoria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small, prospective pilot study, completed by the investigators of this trial, also&#xD;
      supported the hypothesis that bifocals slow myopia progression in children with near-point&#xD;
      esophoria. Thirty-two myopic children, all of whom showed near-point esophoria, were enrolled&#xD;
      in this 18-month study. Twenty-eight children completed the study, with 14 randomized into&#xD;
      bifocals and 14 into single-vision lenses. Cycloplegic automated refraction was performed&#xD;
      every 6 months. Over the course of the whole study, there was a small, statistically&#xD;
      insignificant difference in the rates of myopia progression: 0.57 diopters per year (D/yr)&#xD;
      (S.E. = 0.11) for those in single-vision lenses compared with 0.36 D/yr (S.E. = 0.12) for&#xD;
      those in bifocals (p = 0.26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, significant seasonal effects in myopia progression were demonstrated, and the&#xD;
      results also suggested that the beneficial effects of bifocals may take several months to&#xD;
      develop. During the first 6 months, which included most of the school year, myopia&#xD;
      progression was rapid in both the bifocal group (0.61 D/yr) and the single-vision group (0.68&#xD;
      D/yr). During the second 6 months, which included all of the summer vacation, myopia&#xD;
      progression was slow in both groups, 0.32 and 0.26 D/yr for bifocal wearers and single-vision&#xD;
      wearers, respectively. During the last 6 months, i.e., the second school year, myopia&#xD;
      progressed slowly in the bifocal wearers (0.37 D/yr) but rapidly (0.80 D/yr) in single-vision&#xD;
      wearers. A repeated-measure analysis of variance demonstrated a significant seasonal effect&#xD;
      (p &lt; 0.002) and a significant interaction between season and type of correction (p &lt; 0.043).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The apparent effectiveness of bifocals in children with near-point esophoria and the lack of&#xD;
      effectiveness in other children may be explained by a greater lag of accommodation in&#xD;
      children with esophoria. This lag might cause a slightly blurred retinal image that the&#xD;
      bifocal may sharpen. Other mechanisms might also be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty or more myopic children, all with near-point esophoria as measured at baseline with&#xD;
      von Graefe prisms through a current myopic correction placed in a phoropter, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to wear either single-vision spectacle lenses or lenses with +1.50 D add in a&#xD;
      flat-top 28-mm segment. Subjects will visit one of two sites, either a private optometry&#xD;
      practice in Tulsa or the optometry clinic at Northeastern State University, every 6 months.&#xD;
      Data collected at each visit will include automated refraction after cycloplegia with 1&#xD;
      percent tropicamide, biometry with A-scan, and estimates of the amount of study and other&#xD;
      close work by means of questionnaires administered to the subjects and their parents. We will&#xD;
      also obtain measures of the degree of myopia in the biological parents. The myopic correction&#xD;
      will be changed if the spherical component of the refraction in either eye has changed by 0.5&#xD;
      diopter or more or if any change in cylinder power or axis improves vision in either eye by&#xD;
      three letters or more. The study will continue for 30 months and will include six visits by&#xD;
      each subject.&#xD;

        Boys must have been between 6 and 12 years of age; girls between 6 and 11 years of age. All&#xD;
        children must have had at least 0.5 diopters of myopia in both eyes, near-point esophoria,&#xD;
        at least 20/25 acuity in each eye, and 40 seconds of stereopsis and must have been free of&#xD;
        ocular disease or systemic disease that may have altered refraction. All subjects were&#xD;
        willing to wear bifocal spectacle lenses for 30 months.&#xD;
