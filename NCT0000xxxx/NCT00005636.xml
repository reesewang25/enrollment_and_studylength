      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known if cisplatin is more effective with or without&#xD;
      pemetrexed disodium for malignant mesothelioma of the pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of cisplatin with or without&#xD;
      pemetrexed disodium in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma of the pleura that&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma when treated&#xD;
      with cisplatin with or without LY231514. II. Compare duration of response, time to&#xD;
      progression, and time to treatment failure in these patients with these treatment regimens.&#xD;
      III. Compare tumor response rate and clinical benefit of these treatment regimens in these&#xD;
      patients. IV. Compare Lung Cancer Symptom Scale scores, pulmonary function test scores, and&#xD;
      lung density determinations with these treatment regimens in these patients. V. Compare&#xD;
      toxicity of these treatment regimens in these patients. VI. Assess pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      vitamin metabolite status with these treatment regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, single blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to performance status (Karnofsky 70-80% vs 90-100%), degree of measurability&#xD;
      (bidimensional vs unidimensional only), histologic subtype (epithelial vs all others), WBC&#xD;
      (8,300/mm3 and higher vs less than 8,300/mm3), pain intensity (low vs high), analgesic&#xD;
      consumption (low vs high), dyspnea (low vs high), homocysteine (low vs high), gender,&#xD;
      country, and treatment center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:&#xD;
      Patients receive LY231514 IV over 10 minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least&#xD;
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are&#xD;
      followed at 4 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients (140 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 15 months.&#xD;
