  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of alendronate in treating the bone abnormality in&#xD;
      polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome. In these diseases, areas of&#xD;
      normal bone are replaced with a fibrous growth similar to a scar. The weakened bone causes&#xD;
      pain and increases patients' risk of bone fractures and bone deformities. Alendronate belongs&#xD;
      to a class of drugs called &quot;bisphosphonates,&quot; which are approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration to treat bone weakening, deformity and pain in other medical conditions. It is&#xD;
      thought that bisphosphonates might work by slowing the activity of osteoclasts-cells that&#xD;
      break down bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 12 years of age and older with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia or McCune-Albright&#xD;
      syndrome may be eligible for this 3-year study. Candidates must also be enrolled in NIDCR's&#xD;
      protocol 98-D-0145 (Screening and Natural History of Patients with Polyostotic Fibrous&#xD;
      Dysplasia and McCune-Albright Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: they will take one&#xD;
      capsule a day of either alendronate or placebo (a look-alike capsule that has no active&#xD;
      ingredient). They will take the capsules for 6 months, stop for 6 months, then take them for&#xD;
      another 6 months and then go off them for 6 months. They will then remain off the drug or&#xD;
      placebo for an additional 12 months and complete the study with a final follow-up visit at 36&#xD;
      months. While taking alendronate or placebo, patients will also take calcium and vitamin D to&#xD;
      prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism-a side effect of alendronate in which the bone does not&#xD;
      release enough calcium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will come to NIH for a physical examination and blood and urine tests every 6 months&#xD;
      and for monitoring of their bone disease, vision, hearing, pain levels, functional&#xD;
      evaluation, and photographs every 12 months. Many of the monitoring procedures, including&#xD;
      imaging studies and biopsies, are performed for the screening protocol (98-D-0145) and will&#xD;
      not be duplicated for this study. During the study periods when patients are taking&#xD;
      alendronate or placebo, they will have blood samples drawn by their local physician once&#xD;
      every 3 months and sent to NIH to check for secondary hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at the end of the study alendronate is found to be effective, patients who were in the&#xD;
      placebo treatment group will be offered alendronate for a 24-month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD) is a sporadic disorder which affects multiple sites in&#xD;
      the skeleton. The bone at these sites is rapidly resorbed and replaced by abnormal fibrous&#xD;
      tissue and mechanically abnormal bone. PFD may occur alone or as part of the McCune-Albright&#xD;
      Syndrome (MAS), a syndrome originally defined by the triad of PFD, cafe-au-lait pigmentation&#xD;
      of the skin, and precocious puberty. The bony lesions are frequently disfiguring and painful,&#xD;
      and depending on the location of the lesion, they can cause significant morbidity. Lesions in&#xD;
      weight-bearing bones can lead to disabling fractures, while lesions in the skull can lead to&#xD;
      compression of vital structures such as cranial nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no clearly-defined systemic therapies for this bone disease. Small,&#xD;
      uncontrolled trials using the second generation bisphosphonate, pamidronate, suggest that&#xD;
      bisphosphonates may be effective. This study is a phase 2, controlled, double blinded trial&#xD;
      of the third generation oral bisphosphonate, alendronate for the treatment of fibrous&#xD;
      dysplasia. We propose to show that treatment with alendronate will improve bone quality,&#xD;
      decrease bone pain, decrease fractures, and, if the patient is referred to the companion bone&#xD;
      grafting protocol, will allow for the regeneration of better quality bone.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must be concomitantly enrolled in the companion Screening and Natural History&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any patient with at least 2 active fibrous dysplastic lesions of either the cranial, axial,&#xD;
        or appendicular skeleton will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the study. The&#xD;
        diagnosis will be based on evidence typical findings on bone biopsy (performed during the&#xD;
        &quot;Screening&quot; protocol). Final consideration for enrollment will depend on diagnosis at the&#xD;
        NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be at least 6 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be of child-bearing age, but will be expected to be on a nonhormonal form of&#xD;
        birth control that gives a 95% protection rate. If a patient becomes pregnant during the&#xD;
        course of the study, they must withdraw but will be eligible for re-enrollment upon the&#xD;
        completion of pregnancy and lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients on previous of concomitant therapy are eligible for enrollment. However, patients&#xD;
        who have received previous treatment with a bisphosphonate must wait one year from the&#xD;
        completion of the last course before they can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient, child or parents unwilling to fully cooperate with the evaluation as outlined in&#xD;
        the schedule and consent form and do not give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any sexually active patient that is unwilling to use an appropriate contraceptive&#xD;
        associated with a pregnancy-prevention rate of 95% or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to be evaluated or admitted to the study and is&#xD;
        grounds for removal from the study. However, patients may be re-enrolled once pregnancy and&#xD;
        lactation are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severe esophageal motility problems may put patients at increased risk for complications&#xD;
        from alendronate and are not eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant comorbidities such as decompensated heart failure or diabetes mellitus, renal&#xD;
        or hepatic failure, or decompensated psychiatric conditions exclude patients from&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with either a history of sarcoma of the bone or who have a FD lesion that&#xD;
        undergoes sarcomatous degeneration while enrolled in either this study or any of the&#xD;
        companion protocols.&#xD;
