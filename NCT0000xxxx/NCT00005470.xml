  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To continue examinations of 670 girls enrolled in the National Growth and Health Study (NGHS)&#xD;
      for four more years, adding measurements of total peripheral resistance, cardiac output, DEXA&#xD;
      scans for fat-free mass and fat mass, left ventricular mass and geometry, circulating blood&#xD;
      volume, whole blood viscosity, and left ventricular contractility.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      African-American women have a substantially higher prevalence of hypertension and suffer&#xD;
      greater morbidity and mortality due to blood pressure elevation than white-American women.&#xD;
      Much of this ethnic difference in blood pressure is due to increased obesity in&#xD;
      African-American women. In contrast, young African-American and white-American girls have&#xD;
      similar levels of obesity and blood pressure. The hemodynamic changes that occur with&#xD;
      developing obesity and result in this ethnic difference in blood pressure have not been well&#xD;
      characterized. Cross-sectional studies of adolescents have shown that despite similar blood&#xD;
      pressure levels, African-Americans have higher total peripheral resistance while whites have&#xD;
      higher cardiac output. Cross-sectional studies of adults show that obesity is associated with&#xD;
      elevation of cardiac output. If such an obesity-related increase in cardiac output is&#xD;
      superimposed on the underlying elevation of total peripheral resistance in African-American&#xD;
      girls, these hemodynamic factors could be responsible for the developing ethnic divergence in&#xD;
      blood pressure seen in late adolescence as African-American girls develop an increasing&#xD;
      prevalence and severity of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will provide important new knowledge regarding the longitudinal changes&#xD;
      and interrelationships among the potential hemodynamic factors which define the association&#xD;
      between developing obesity and blood pressure elevation. In the clinical setting where&#xD;
      obesity is very difficult to prevent or treat, it is important to understand the mechanisms&#xD;
      by which obesity results in elevated blood pressure. The results of this cohort study will&#xD;
      provide the basis for rational and specific clinical strategies to interrupt the&#xD;
      pathophysiologic process by which obesity leads to hypertension and places African-American&#xD;
      women at particularly increased risk for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NGHS was initiated by the NHLBI in 1985 as a contract-supported program to determine if&#xD;
      the Black-white differences in the development of obesity in 2,379 pubescent females were due&#xD;
      to differences in psychosocial, socioeconomic and other environmental factors. The study also&#xD;
      sought to determine whether differences in the development of obesity led to Black-white&#xD;
      differences in other coronary heart disease risk factors, such as blood pressure and serum&#xD;
      lipids. The study has been renewed twice, the last time as an investigator-initiated study.&#xD;
      See the National Growth and Health Study for the complete write-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ancillary study is a prospective cohort study of 355 African-American and 315&#xD;
      white-American females from the NHLBl Growth and Health Study as these women progress from&#xD;
      age 18-19 years to age 21-22 years. The study includes yearly measurement of anthropometrics,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and echocardiographic determination of cardiac output and total peripheral&#xD;
      resistance. In addition, factors which may relate to changes in cardiac output and total&#xD;
      peripheral resistance, such as circulating blood volume (left ventricular end-diastolic&#xD;
      volume), heart rate, left ventricular contractility, whole blood viscosity, and left&#xD;
      ventricular mass and geometry are measured.&#xD;
