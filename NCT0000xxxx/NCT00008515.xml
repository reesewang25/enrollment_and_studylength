  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a fluocinolone implant to treat&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration. This eye disease can severely impair central vision,&#xD;
      affecting a person's ability to read, drive, and carry out daily activities. It is the&#xD;
      leading cause of vision loss in people over age 60. The fluocinolone implant is a tiny&#xD;
      plastic rod with a pellet of the steroid fluocinolone on the end. The pellet slowly dissolves&#xD;
      and releases the medication into the fluid in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vision loss in macular degeneration is caused by the formation of new blood vessels in the&#xD;
      choroid-a thin, pigmented vascular layer of the eye behind the retina. These abnormal vessels&#xD;
      leak blood under the macula, the part of the retina that determines central vision. Tissue&#xD;
      studies show evidence of inflammation in the retinas of patients. This study will test&#xD;
      whether the slow release of the steroid fluocinolone directly into the affected part of the&#xD;
      eye can prevent or slow further vision loss. Preliminary animal and human studies with&#xD;
      fluocinolone implants have shown some benefit in reducing blood vessel growth and improving&#xD;
      or stabilizing vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 50 years of age and older with age-related macular degeneration may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Study patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One will&#xD;
      receive a 0.5-mg dose implant; the other will receive a 2-mg dose implant. Theoretically, the&#xD;
      implants can release the medicine for 2 to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history, physical examination and complete eye examination.&#xD;
      The latter will include a vision test, eye pressure measurement, examination of the pupils,&#xD;
      lens, retina, and eye movements. Photographs of the eye will be taken with a special camera.&#xD;
      Patients will also undergo fluorescein angiography, a test that takes pictures of the retina&#xD;
      using a yellow dye called sodium fluorescein. The dye is injected into the blood stream&#xD;
      through a vein. After it reaches the blood vessels of the eye, photographs are taken of the&#xD;
      retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the above tests are completed, patients will be scheduled for surgery to place the&#xD;
      implant. The procedure will be done under either local or general anesthesia. Follow-up&#xD;
      visits will be scheduled 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after surgery, then at 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      surgery, and then every 6 months until the implant is depleted of medicine or is removed.&#xD;
      Several of the exams described above will be repeated during the follow-up period to evaluate&#xD;
      the treatment and side effects, if any.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in&#xD;
      patients over the age of 60. Most vision loss in this disease results from sequelae of&#xD;
      choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) formation. CNVM is usually composed of well-formed&#xD;
      neovascularization and occult (less well-formed) neovascularization. While clinical trials&#xD;
      have shown that some patients, mostly those with well-formed CNVM, may benefit from laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy, at present there is no treatment for patients who&#xD;
      have a large component of occult neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal histopathology of patients with choroidal neovascularization demonstrates the&#xD;
      presence of inflammatory and reparative responses. We hypothesize that sustained intraocular&#xD;
      corticosteroids may be able to down-regulate many of the cellular factors involved in both&#xD;
      inflammation and repair, resulting in stabilization of CNVM formation and vision. We will&#xD;
      test this hypothesis using a randomized, prospective study. Persons having an eligible eye&#xD;
      with occult choroidal neovascularization will be randomly assigned to receive either a 0.5&#xD;
      microgram/day or a 2 microgram/day sustained-release fluocinolone intravitreal implant. The&#xD;
      study is designed to provide limited safety and potential efficacy data regarding these&#xD;
      sustained intravitreal devices. The primary outcome of the study will be implant safety as&#xD;
      determined by potential, implant related, adverse advents. These events can be related to the&#xD;
      surgical insertion of the intravitreal implants, such as endophthalmitis, hypotony, retinal&#xD;
      detachment and hemorrhage, those related to complications of the anesthesia, such as&#xD;
      retrobulbar hemorrhage or complications of general anesthesia, if used, and those related to&#xD;
      intraocular fluocinolone such as development of glaucoma and cataract formation. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy outcome will be proportion of patients, at two years, who have not lost two lines or&#xD;
      more of visual acuity from baseline (best corrected visual acuity has improved, remained&#xD;
      stable, or deteriorated by no more than 9 letters). Secondary efficacy outcome measures will&#xD;
      include the size of predominate occult CNVM, as determined by fluorescein angiography, and&#xD;
      visual function, as measured by the NEI VFQ. This study will allow investigators to determine&#xD;
      some of the potential risks for patients receiving intravitreal fluocinolone and may provide&#xD;
      insight into the potential role of the intravitreal placement of steroids in the treatment of&#xD;
      predominate occult CNVM associated with AMD.&#xD;
