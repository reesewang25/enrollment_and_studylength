  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by reversible airflow&#xD;
      obstruction. Fourteen million persons (6.4%) in the United States report having asthma, and&#xD;
      from 1980 to 1994 the prevalence of self-reported asthma in the United States increased by&#xD;
      75%. A major factor in the pathogenesis of asthma is the development of an allergic&#xD;
      inflammatory response to inhaled antigens. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) plays a key role in this&#xD;
      response by promoting IgE production, upregulating IgE receptors, upregulating adhesion&#xD;
      receptors such as VCAM-1, promoting Th2 cell development and increasing mucus secretion.&#xD;
      Soluble recombinantly produced IL-4R (sIL-4R) has been shown to bind and inactivate IL-4,&#xD;
      both in vitro and in animal models. As part of a multicenter trial, 20 subjects at the NIH&#xD;
      site will receive 0.9 mg., 1.8 mg. sIL-4R or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks in a double&#xD;
      blind placebo controlled study. Study drug will be delivered via the AERx aerosol drug&#xD;
      delivery device. The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate efficacy as measured&#xD;
      by FEV1. Secondary objectives will include changes in FVC, FEF 27-75, peak flow,&#xD;
      bronchodilator usage, asthma symptoms, quality of life scores, immunologic and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity. The study population will consist of&#xD;
      moderate to severe asthmatics on (Beta)-agonist monotherapy with an FEV1 of 50-80% of&#xD;
      predicted. After 12 weeks of study drug, subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks.&#xD;
