  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a type of anti-HIV therapy called HAART is effective&#xD;
      in lowering levels of HIV and boosting the immune system in HIV-infected patients with&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with TB have higher levels of HIV and lower CD4 cell counts (cells in&#xD;
      the body that fight infection) than HIV-infected patients without TB. HAART has been&#xD;
      effective in reducing HIV levels and increasing CD4 cells in patients without TB. However,&#xD;
      its effects in HIV-infected patients with TB are unknown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have focused on characterizing viral and immune dynamics after initiation of&#xD;
      HAART in patients without opportunistic infection. The development of TB in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals is associated with an elevation in HIV RNA levels, a decrease in CD4 cell counts,&#xD;
      and an increase in activated (CD38) lymphocytes and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha, and IL-6). Response to HAART may differ in individuals with an active&#xD;
      opportunistic infection such as TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with active TB follow an anti-TB regimen including rifabutin and are&#xD;
      observed for a maximum of 24 weeks before they initiate HAART. Plasma samples for 24-hour&#xD;
      post-rifabutin dosing are collected at entry and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12, then again at Weeks&#xD;
      2, 3, 4, 12, and 24 after HAART initiation. Analyses of these samples are used to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between cytokines and rifabutin metabolism and the effect of nelfinavir on&#xD;
      rifabutin pharmacokinetics. The HAART regimen is nelfinavir plus lamivudine (3TC) plus either&#xD;
      zidovudine (ZDV) or stavudine (d4T). After initiation of HAART, all patients undergo&#xD;
      intensive monitoring of viral and immune dynamics for 2 months. The patients continue to be&#xD;
      followed for 1 year from the time of starting HAART. Neither the HAART drug regimen nor&#xD;
      anti-TB medications will be provided by the study and must be obtained by prescription. If&#xD;
      patients are intolerant of the HAART regimen or exhibit virologic rebound, primary providers&#xD;
      can alter or modify this regimen. As part of substudy A5065s, patients who experience signs&#xD;
      or symptoms of paradoxical reactions (i.e., new persistent fevers that develop after&#xD;
      initiating HAART and which last for more than 1 week without an identifiable source; marked&#xD;
      worsening or emergence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates; worsening or&#xD;
      emergence of cervical adenopathy on serial physical examinations; or worsening of other&#xD;
      tuberculous lesions) have additional clinical evaluations (including a chest x-ray, a target&#xD;
      clinical assessment, concomitant medications, and signs and symptoms) weekly for 4 weeks,&#xD;
      then every month thereafter until the symptoms resolve.&#xD;
