  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug TNFR:Fc to treat uveitis&#xD;
      (eye inflammation) in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In other studies, TNFR:Fc&#xD;
      significantly reduced joint pain and swelling in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      and the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug for that use. Because medicines&#xD;
      for arthritis often help patients with eye inflammation, this study will examine whether&#xD;
      TNFR:Fc can help patients with uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with uveitis who are not responding well to standard treatment, such as steroids,&#xD;
      and patients who have side effects from other medicines used to treat their uveitis or have&#xD;
      refused treatment because of possible side effects may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and eye examination. The eye&#xD;
      exam includes a check of vision and eye pressure, examination of the back of the eye&#xD;
      (retina), and front of the eye, including measurements of protein and inflammation.&#xD;
      Candidates will also undergo fluorescein angiography-a procedure in which photographs are&#xD;
      taken of the retina to see if there is any leakage in the eye's blood vessels. A blood test&#xD;
      and joint evaluation will also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be given a shot of TNFR:Fc twice a week for up to 12 months and may&#xD;
      continue other medicines they may be taking, such as prednisone or methotrexate. They will&#xD;
      have follow-up examinations at week two and months one, two, three and four. Those who wish&#xD;
      to continue treatment after the fourth month can receive the drug for another eight months&#xD;
      and will have follow-up exams at months six, nine and 12, and one month after treatment ends.&#xD;
      Each follow-up visit will include a repeat of the screening exams and an evaluation of side&#xD;
      effects or discomfort from the medicine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current treatment modalities for uveitis associated with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA)&#xD;
      including corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents are associated with significant&#xD;
      side effects. These treatments are not effective for all children. A soluble tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor receptor (TNFR:Fc) named Etanercept, may inhibit the inflammatory response of uveitis.&#xD;
      This randomized double-masked phase I/II clinical trial will provide limited safety and&#xD;
      efficacy information regarding the use of Etanercept for the treatment of uveitis associated&#xD;
      with JRA. Fifteen patients will be randomized with a 2 to 1 randomization plan (10 to receive&#xD;
      Etanercept, 5 to receive placebo) and followed for 6 months. After the 6 month visit, all&#xD;
      patients will receive open label Etanercept for an additional 6 months. Patients will be&#xD;
      switched to open label Etanercept, or withdrawn from study therapy prior to 6 months, if they&#xD;
      a) experience a greater than 10 letter or greater drop in visual acuity due to inflammation,&#xD;
      for patients using the ETDRS chart (a 2 line drop due to inflammation, for patients using the&#xD;
      B-VAT method) or b) develop a sight-threatening inflammatory ophthalmic or joint lesion&#xD;
      requiring immediate increase in systemic anti-inflammatory therapy or a periocular injection&#xD;
      of corticosteriods or c) at 4 months, have greater than 1 plus anterior chamber cell grade in&#xD;
      either eye and are receiving topical corticosteroids on a schedule of TID or more frequently.&#xD;
      Investigators will remain masked to original treatment assignment unless warranted by&#xD;
      clinical care considerations. Primary safety outcomes include the occurrence of any severe&#xD;
      adverse event at least possibly related to study therapy, including a two step increase in&#xD;
      anterior chamber cells, or the occurrence of serious infection or sepsis. Primary ophthalmic&#xD;
      outcomes include measures of anterior chamber cells and a change in topical or systemic&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications used to treat uveitis. Primary ophthalmic and JRA outcome&#xD;
      analysis will be performed at 6 months, and again at 12 months. Patients unmasked or switched&#xD;
      to open label Etanercept prior to month 6 or withdrawing from the study drug prior to month&#xD;
      12 will be considered failures.&#xD;
