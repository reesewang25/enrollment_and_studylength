  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common problem following a kidney transplant is the development of acute or chronic&#xD;
      rejection. Rejection is the immunologic reaction in which the body refuses to accept the&#xD;
      transplanted organ. The body's immune system will make destructive antibodies that will&#xD;
      attempt to attack the transplanted organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prevent organ rejection, all patients receiving an allograft (a graft&#xD;
      transplanted between genetically non-identical individuals of the same species) must take&#xD;
      anti-rejection therapy. These medications function by lowering the body's natural immune&#xD;
      system. Often these medications are associated with significant side effects ranging from&#xD;
      infections to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test whether the drug presently known as BG9588 (Antova TM) can&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of organ rejection following kidney transplants in humans. More&#xD;
      specifically, the study will attempt to assess the safety of BG9588 when given alone or when&#xD;
      given in combination with other anti-rejection therapies. Safety will be measured by the&#xD;
      amount of acute or chronic rejections, and immunological graft losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects for the study will be made up of non-human primates (monkeys) and humans. Up to 5&#xD;
      subjects in each of the groups receiving kidney transplants will be placed on a 12 month&#xD;
      course of BG9588 with or without additional anti-rejection drugs. BG9588 will be given&#xD;
      intravenously (injected through a vein) prior to the transplant and then in a decreased dose&#xD;
      with a decreased frequency over the year. Following the 12 months of therapy subjects may be&#xD;
      eligible for additional monthly therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term follow up will occur through 30 months after the last dose of BG9588. Subjects&#xD;
      will undergo periodic tests and evaluations throughout the course of the study. These tests&#xD;
      will assess the body's immune system and detect the presence of rejection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is an open label, non-randomized study designed to test whether treatment with&#xD;
      BG9588, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for CD154, can induce a state of allograft&#xD;
      tolerance following renal allotransplantation in humans. This study is designed to primarily&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of BG9588 when given alone or in combination with steroids and&#xD;
      mycophenolate to prevent renal allograft rejection without the use of calcineurin inhibitors&#xD;
      or other chronic anti-rejection therapies. Efficacy parameters will include the incidence of&#xD;
      acute and chronic rejection episodes, and immunological graft loss. Additional evaluation&#xD;
      will be performed to specifically assess the development of donor-specific immune&#xD;
      hyporesponsiveness resulting from the use of BG9588.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on extensive use of BG9588 in non-human primates and pilot evaluation in&#xD;
      humans. Up to five patients in each group receiving primary renal allografts will be treated&#xD;
      with a 12-month course of BG9588 with or without steroids and mycophenolate to prevent&#xD;
      allograft rejection. The recruitment will be performed first in the group with steroids and&#xD;
      mycophenolate. Subjects will receive BG9588 at a dose of 70 mg/kg (based on ideal body weight&#xD;
      at baseline) via a continuous 60 minute IV infusion within 24 hours pre-operatively followed&#xD;
      by a 30 mg/kg dose via a continuous 30 minute IV infusion on the following days: within 24&#xD;
      hours post-transplantation, and on days 3, 10, 18, 28, then monthly through 12 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation. The enrollment will be staggered such that early efficacy will be&#xD;
      demonstrated in 5 patients prior to completing enrollment. Following 12 months of therapy,&#xD;
      patients may be extended to receive additional monthly therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow up will occur through 30 months after the last dose of BG9588. Mechanistic&#xD;
      evaluations testing for allograft tolerance will be performed throughout the study including&#xD;
      evaluations for allospecific T cell deletion, allospecific T cell anergy, and alloantibody&#xD;
      production. The donor population for this study will include both living donors and cadaveric&#xD;
      donors. This is being done to address the theoretical concern that ischemic reperfusion&#xD;
      injury may negatively affect the efficacy of BG9588.&#xD;
