      To elucidate the biochemical, metabolic, and genetic markers and mechanisms of macrovascular&#xD;
      disease in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macrovascular disease is the leading cause of death due to IDDM. Risk markers have been&#xD;
      identified in non-diabetic populations, but may not apply to IDDM. The theme of the program&#xD;
      project is that hyperglycemia interacts with specific factors to augment vascular risk and&#xD;
      establish novel mechanisms of atherogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients under study originally participated in the DCCT, a recently concluded NIKKD clinical&#xD;
      trial that demonstrated dramatic reductions in microvascular complications with intensive&#xD;
      glucose control. The DCCT, conducted from 1983 to 1993 in 1,441 insulin dependent diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus subjects at 209 medical centers, showed that keeping blood sugar levels as close to&#xD;
      normal as possible slows the onset and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve diseases cause&#xD;
      by diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is part of the initiative, The Etiology of Excess Cardiovascular Disease in&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus, which was released in December 1995. The initiative originated after&#xD;
      discussions between the NHLBI and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (JDFI), a&#xD;
      voluntary organization that supports research on diabetes. Both agreed that a combination of&#xD;
      advances in understanding the etiology of diabetes and of cardiovascular diseases made this&#xD;
      an oppportune time to stimulate further research to understand the reasons for the excessive&#xD;
      macrovascular complications associated with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this program project grant, three of five subprojects are epidemiological studies. In the&#xD;
      first subproject, Glycoxidation and Macrovascular Disease in Diabetes, Timothy J. Lyons,&#xD;
      subproject principal investigator, investigates the mechanisms underlying accelerated&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in diabetes, specifically, the modification of lipids, proteins, and&#xD;
      carbohydrates by interrelated oxidation and glycation (glycoxidation). The cross-sectional&#xD;
      and longitudinal study uses approximately 900 Type 1 diabetic patients from the Epidemiology&#xD;
      of Diabetes Intervention and Complications Study (EDIC), a multicenter study which follows&#xD;
      patients from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), both of which were&#xD;
      supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).&#xD;
      Cross-sectional studies are performed for a detailed analysis of potentially atherogenic low&#xD;
      density lipoproteins and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in patients with and without&#xD;
      microalbuminuria and macrovascular disease. In a smaller cohort of the same patients,&#xD;
      categorized as prone or resistant to macrovascular disease, levels of glycation and oxidation&#xD;
      products are determined in insoluble skin collagen, a long-lived protein in which&#xD;
      modifications may reflect integrated glycoxidation over many years. In the longitudinal arm&#xD;
      of the study, characterizations of lipoproteins in selected patients are repeated in selected&#xD;
      patients who progress either to microalbuminuria or macrovascular disease. By combining&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal information, the investigators hope to identify new markers&#xD;
      to identify diabetic patients at particular risk of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Subproject 4, The Role of Thrombosis in Macrovascular Disease in IDDM, John Colwell as&#xD;
      subproject principal investigator, investigates abnormalities in hemostasis as contributors&#xD;
      to the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes mellitus. Each&#xD;
      of 200 EDIC patient enrolled in the study and non-diabetic, control subjects are assessed for&#xD;
      endogenous fibrinolysis and are evaluated for prothrombin activation fragment F1+2 as an&#xD;
      index of thrombin generation and fibrinogen and hematocrit as basic hemorheologic parameters.&#xD;
      The studies are conducted cross-sectionally in the total EDIC cohort, and longitudinally in&#xD;
      selected EDIC patients whose diabetes either has not progressed or has progressed to&#xD;
      microalbuminuria or macrovascular disease. Hemostasis parameters are correlated with other&#xD;
      metabolic characteristics measured in the program project grant and with PAI-1 and fibrinogen&#xD;
      gene polymorphism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Subproject 5, Metabolic and Genetic Factors in IDDM Vascular Disease, W. Timothy Garvey&#xD;
      subproject principal investigator, investigates whether metabolic and genetic factors are&#xD;
      associated with the development of macrovascular disease or albuminuria in approximately 60&#xD;
      IDDM patients. The investigators have developed the concept, based on published and pre-data,&#xD;
      that patients with upper body fat distribution who become diabetic exhibit primary&#xD;
      abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism which secondarily exacerbate insulin resistance via&#xD;
      alterations in fatty acid composition of skeletal muscle membranes, vascular reactivity via&#xD;
      functional and structural changes in the vessel wall, and consequently vascular disease risk.&#xD;
      They are testing the hypothesis that, in patients with vascular complications, poor glycemic&#xD;
      control alters both circulating free fatty acids and fatty acid composition of muscle&#xD;
      membranes to enhance vascular reactivity and induce insulin resistance. They are performing&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps in three IDDM subgroups (without complications, with&#xD;
      albuminuria, and with macrovascular disease) under conditions of poor glycemic control and&#xD;
      after intensive therapy to asses both glycemia-dependent and independent components of&#xD;
      insulin resistance. They are also testing the hypothesis that insulin resistance and&#xD;
      candidate gene polymorphisms determine in part which IDDM patients develop macrovascular&#xD;
      disease and albuminuria. They are assessing candidate gene polymorphisms in all DCCT&#xD;
      patients, and testing for linkage/association with macro- and microvascular disease outcomes,&#xD;
      as well as for abnormalities in encoded proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in FY 2001 and is scheduled to end in 2006.&#xD;
