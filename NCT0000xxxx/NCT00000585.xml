      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For over 20 years children with sickle cell anemia have been known to have an increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to severe bacterial infection, particularly due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.&#xD;
      Meningitis, pneumonia and septicemia due to this organism have been recognized as the major&#xD;
      causes of death for these children, with children under three years of age being at highest&#xD;
      risk. The annual incidence of pneumococcal septicemia among young children with sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia appears to have remained remarkably constant over the last two decades at&#xD;
      approximately 10 percent. This illness can often be fulminant, progressing from the onset of&#xD;
      fever to death in less than 12 hours, with a case fatality rate ranging as high as 35&#xD;
      percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Penicillin prophylaxis has been advocated as a preventive measure against severe pneumococcal&#xD;
      infections in children with sickle cell anemia. One study had shown that the risk of&#xD;
      pneumococcal infection in these children could be reduced by the use of parenteral&#xD;
      penicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred&#xD;
      and five patients were assigned to the penicillin group and 110 to placebo. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint was a documented severe infection due to S. pneumoniae. The secondary endpoint was a&#xD;
      severe infection due to an organism other than S. pneumoniae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because data were not available to define the age at which prophylactic penicillin could be&#xD;
      safely discontinued, the NHLBI launched Phase II of the Prophylactic Penicillin Study&#xD;
      beginning in 1987. Recruitment ended in August, 1993. The clinical phase of Phase II ended in&#xD;
      August, 1994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II was a multi-center randomized trial to evaluate the hazards of discontinuing daily&#xD;
      oral penicillin at the age of five years. Within three months of their fifth birthdays, all&#xD;
      children were randomized to continue oral penicillin prophylaxis or to stop prophylaxis. Each&#xD;
      child was followed for a minimum of two years. The primary endpoint was a comparison of&#xD;
      documented pneumococcal infection in children continuing penicillin after five years of age&#xD;
      versus children whose prophylaxis was stopped at five years of age. Ancillary studies&#xD;
      conducted in subsets of patients included: the prevalence of colonization of the nasopharynx&#xD;
      with antibiotic resistant microorangisms; and the relationship of antibody response to&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccination to the incidence of pneumococcal sepsis in this patient population.&#xD;
