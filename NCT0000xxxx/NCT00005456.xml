      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in Fiscal Year 1975, the multidisciplinary SCOR examined causes, consequences, and&#xD;
      treatments of human hypertension. A central theme was the renal basis for human hypertension.&#xD;
      The subproject on calcium metabolism and the renin-angiotensin system in hypertensive and&#xD;
      normal pregnancy began in December, 1990.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A longitudinal study was performed on normal pregnant women and women with chronic&#xD;
      hypertension who had a high incidence of superimposed preeclampsia. In a previous study, the&#xD;
      investigators had demonstrated that preeclampsia was associated with reduced urinary&#xD;
      excretion of calcium and with lower plasma renin activity (PRA) compared with normal&#xD;
      pregnancy. The goal of the investigators was to identify the metabolic and cellular basis for&#xD;
      these alterations in calcium homeostasis and in the renin angiotensin system. They tested two&#xD;
      hypotheses. The first hypothesis was that diminished placental and/or renal production of&#xD;
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, leading to lower serum calcium, higher parathyroid hormone, and&#xD;
      increased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium, was the metabolic basis for hypocalciuria in&#xD;
      preeclampsia. The second hypothesis was that lower PRA in preeclampsia was due to systemic&#xD;
      and renal vasoconstriction with hypertension and diminished natriuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial measurements of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, serum ionized calcium,&#xD;
      PRA, estradiol and progesterone, and urinary calcium and electrolytes were obtained,&#xD;
      particularly at the onset of preeclampsia. Acute renal hemodynamic studies were also&#xD;
      performed in women with preeclampsia and in gestational age matched normals. The studies&#xD;
      investigated the relationships among glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow,&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, atrial natriuretic factor, renin, estradiol and progesterone,&#xD;
      and sodium and calcium excretion during infusion of inulin and PAH with either saline or&#xD;
      calcium chloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracellular free calcium concentration in platelets and lymphocytes of pregnant women&#xD;
      participating in longitudinal and acute renal hemodynamic studies were also measured. Basal&#xD;
      and stimulated (with angiotensin II, ionomycin and thrombin), intracellular free calcium&#xD;
      concentrations were compared in normal and hypertensive pregnant women and correlated with&#xD;
      calcium regulatory hormones, plasma renin activity and hypertension.&#xD;
