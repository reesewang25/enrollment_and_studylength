      This study will determine the rate of sugar metabolism in the brain of patients with Fabry&#xD;
      disease, a genetic disease of abnormal lipid metabolism. Compared with healthy people,&#xD;
      patients with Fabry disease have increased blood flow to the brain, which may result from&#xD;
      abnormal brain metabolic activity. This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare brain sugar metabolism in eight untreated&#xD;
      patients, eight patients who are receiving enzyme replacement therapy, and eight healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with treated and untreated Fabry disease and normal volunteers may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Participants will undergo the following two procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PET scan &lt; The patient lies in the PET scanning machine. First, the chest is scanned for&#xD;
           a few minutes to determine how much radiation the tissues of the chest absorb. A&#xD;
           radioactive sugar called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is then injected through a catheter&#xD;
           (thin plastic tube placed in a vein) and the heart is scanned for about 45 minutes to&#xD;
           measure the amount of FDG in the blood inside the heart. The head is then scanned for&#xD;
           about 20 minutes to measure FDG in the brain. This measurement tells how much sugar the&#xD;
           brain uses for energy. The procedure requires insertion of two or three catheters. A&#xD;
           special facemask may be molded to the patient's head to help hold the head still during&#xD;
           the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRI scan &lt; The patient lies on a table surrounded by the scanner (a metal cylinder) for&#xD;
           about 60 minutes. A strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to show images of&#xD;
           structural and chemical changes in tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may provide information that will help explain abnormalities in Fabry disease and&#xD;
      the effect of treatment on the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have found that patients with Fabry disease have an increased resting global cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow compared with healthy subjects. This augmentation may result from an abnormal&#xD;
      metabolic activity in the brain of the patients. The goal of this protocol is to study the&#xD;
      cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRGlu) in eight untreated patients with Fabry disease,&#xD;
      eight Fabry patients who are receiving enzyme replacement therapy and compare it with the&#xD;
      rCMRGlu eight in healthy volunteers. In order to minimize the need for arterial lines we&#xD;
      shall image the left ventricle of the heart to obtain the (18)FDG time-activity curve needed&#xD;
      to measure rCMRGlu. The method will be validated in the healthy volunteers.&#xD;
