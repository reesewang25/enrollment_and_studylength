      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although excessive left ventricular mass has been viewed as an adaptation to increased blood&#xD;
      pressure, it can precede the rise in blood pressure in hypertensive models. Excessive growth&#xD;
      of the heart may reflect additional factors contributing to eventual level of blood pressure.&#xD;
      In children, rapid heart growth may be predictive of subsequent high childhood blood pressure&#xD;
      level and greater incidence of cardiovascular disease in adult relatives. These studies had&#xD;
      the potential of defining maturational changes in known risk factors which might help predict&#xD;
      future hypertensive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a subproject within a Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) in Hypertension.&#xD;
      The Request for Applications for the SCOR was released in October, 1988.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 124 prepubertal males and females were followed longitudinally for five years.&#xD;
      Yearly examinations defined the stages of sexual maturation. On four occasions each year,&#xD;
      subjects were studied for resting and ambulatory blood pressure, echocardiography,&#xD;
      anthropometry and activity assessment. Once yearly, each subject had blood drawn for hormone&#xD;
      analyses and whole blood viscosity estimate. From these data, growth velocities of the heart&#xD;
      and rate of change of blood pressure were determined. These parameters were analyzed to&#xD;
      determine if rapid growth of the heart preceded or followed the rise in blood pressure&#xD;
      observed during puberty and body size and composition, sexual maturation and hormone changes,&#xD;
      and sympathetic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a subproject within a SCOR in Hypertension. Approximately 7 percent of total&#xD;
      dollars were awarded for this subproject.&#xD;
&#xD;
