    <textblock>
      This protocol will follow patients who participated in NIAID's study Gene Therapy Approach&#xD;
      for Chronic Granulomatous Diseases (95-I-0134). No further gene therapy treatments will be&#xD;
      given under this protocol. However, because gene therapy is a new technology and involves a&#xD;
      permanent change in the genetic code of some cells, patients who have had this treatment&#xD;
      require long-term health monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide updated address and telephone information and the names&#xD;
      of two contact persons, such as siblings or friends. Patients will be seen about once a year&#xD;
      at the NIH Clinical Center to provide an update on their health status and donate a small&#xD;
      blood sample (about 2 teaspoons), which will be frozen and stored. If a patient acquires a&#xD;
      serious illness, such as cancer, his or her stored blood will be tested; another of blood or&#xD;
      tissue sample may also be requested for further study. If a patient develops a medical&#xD;
      problem that is thought possibly to be related to gene therapy, the illness will be&#xD;
      investigated. The annual follow-up visits will continue indefinitely or until the patient&#xD;
      declines to continue participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also agree to store some of their blood future research on chronic&#xD;
      granulomatous diseases and other medical conditions. Stored samples may be labeled with a&#xD;
      code, such as a number, that only the study team can link with the patient. Any identifying&#xD;
      information about the patient will be kept confidential as is permitted by law.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of a method of ex&#xD;
      vivo gene therapy to treat both X-linked gp91phox deficient Chronic Granulomatous Disease&#xD;
      (CGD) and autosomal recessive p47phox deficient CGD. CGD is an inherited immune deficiency in&#xD;
      which blood neutrophils and monocytes fail to produce superoxide and other antimicrobial&#xD;
      oxidants, and patients get recurrent life-threatening infections. 30 CGD patients of either&#xD;
      sex at least 5 years of age may be enrolled in addition to the 5 patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      first phase of this trial. Patients less than 16 years of age must have an active infection&#xD;
      or a recent relapse of infection at the time of enrollment. Patients may receive up to 6&#xD;
      cycles of stem cell mobilization for gene therapy at intervals of 4 weeks or longer. For up&#xD;
      to first 3 cycles, a cycle of stem cell mobilization for gene therapy will begin with 8 daily&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of the combination of flt3-ligand (flt3L) at 50 micro g/kg/day plus&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at 5 micro g/kg/day for&#xD;
      mobilization of CD34+ cells. For 3 or more of the cycles of mobilization of CD34+ cells for&#xD;
      gene therapy (up to the maximum of 6 cycles total), the mobilization will begin with 6 daily&#xD;
      injections of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 10 micro g/kg/day. On the last&#xD;
      two or three days of marrow growth factor administration for mobilization of CD34+ cells, the&#xD;
      patients will have an apheresis procedure to harvest blood mononuclear cells, thus completing&#xD;
      a cycle of mobilization and stem cell harvest. CD34+ progenitors will be selected from the&#xD;
      apheresis collection using the Isolex(Registered Trademark) 300i anti-CD34 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody/magnetic bead selection system. The purified CD34+ cells may either be placed&#xD;
      directly into culture or may be cryopreserved as per standard blood bank procedure (freezing&#xD;
      in autologous serum with 10% dimethylsufoxide {DMSO}) and stored frozen at liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      temperature until thawed for ex vivo culture and transduction. For a specific gene therapy&#xD;
      treatment of intravenously infused, gene corrected stem cells, the purified CD34+ stem cells&#xD;
      collected, purified and frozen from one or more cycles of mobilization will be thawed and&#xD;
      then pooled at the time of placement into culture for transduction with the virus vector.&#xD;
      CD34+ cells will be cultured in PL2417 gas permeable plastic containers that have been&#xD;
      pre-coated with fibronectin fragment CH-296. The growth medium will be serum-free X-VIVO&#xD;
      10(Registered Trademark) supplemented with 1% human serum albumin, 100 ng/ml flt3-ligand, 50&#xD;
      ng/ml PIXY321 and 50 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF). Cultured CD34+ progenitors will be&#xD;
      transduced on each of 3 or 4 days with either MFGS-p47phox or MFGS-gp91phox retrovirus&#xD;
      vectors. The retrovirus vectors are replication defective packaged in amphotropic envelope&#xD;
      lines engineered with the CRIP packaging elements (5' LTR-gag-pol-3'SV40polyA;&#xD;
      5'LTR-AMenv-3'SV40polyA). MFGS-p47phox is packaged in the murine psi-crip line, while&#xD;
      MFGS-gp91phox is packaged in the human 293-SPA line. The clinical retrovirus vector supernate&#xD;
      will be animal protein-free and serum free. Safety testing for endotoxin, sterility, and&#xD;
      absence of replication competent retrovirus will be performed on the retrovirus producer&#xD;
      lines, virus particle lots, and transduced cells. Transduced CD34+ cells will be infused into&#xD;
      the CGD patient. Thus, there will be a total of up to six cycles of stem cell mobilization,&#xD;
      but because the CD34+ cells from one or more cycles of mobilization may be cryopreserved and&#xD;
      then later pooled for culture to produce a single gene corrected stem cell product for&#xD;
      infusion, there may be fewer than six rounds (and possibly only one round) of gene therapy&#xD;
      treatments for a patient who participates in this study. Blood will be tested periodically&#xD;
      for the appearance and persistence of neutrophils that are functionally corrected by the gene&#xD;
      therapy. The efficacy goal for this study is to allow CGD patients to produce autologous&#xD;
      gene-corrected functionally normal NADPH oxidase positive neutrophils to a level of at least&#xD;
      1 in 1000 circulating neutrophils for at least four weeks. This may provide clinical benefit&#xD;
      in the form of increased host defense against an ongoing or potential infection. The clinical&#xD;
      status of patients will be monitored for any evidence of toxicity. Information obtained from&#xD;
      this study will provide information important for achieving the ultimate goal of the&#xD;
      development of gene therapy for CGD that will be a permanent cure for this disorder.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients who are pregnant or lactating as determined by history and/or positive&#xD;
        pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        While patients may have an active infection under treatment and still be included in the&#xD;
        study, patients are excluded who are in shock, manifested by severe hypotension (less than&#xD;
        100 systolic or less than 60 diastolic) or severe hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation&#xD;
        and piO(2) greater than 40 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV antibody/antigen positive or hepatitis B, C antigen positive. (Exceptions to this&#xD;

        (hematocrit/hemoglobin below less than 26/8), in adequate venous access, and/or severe&#xD;
        coagulation disorder. Patients with severe infection who have a hematocrit/hemoglobin below&#xD;
        less than 26/8 and might benefit clinically from participation in this protocol may undergo&#xD;
        apheresis at the discretion of the physician in charge of the Apheresis Unit. In that&#xD;
        setting RBC transfusion may be used to raise the hematocrit/hemoglobin to a level safe for&#xD;
        apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition which in the opinion of the principal investigator or the patient's primary&#xD;
        physician contraindicates administration of bone marrow growth factors at the indicated&#xD;
        doses, such as preexisting severe autoimmune vasculitis or other severe autoimmune&#xD;
        inflammatory conditions where augmentation of immune responses or infiltration of&#xD;
        granulocytes may exacerbate the condition.&#xD;
