      This protocol is designed to evaluate children with cancer who appear to be probable&#xD;
      candidates for future protocol entry or have disease manifestations that are of unique&#xD;
      scientific importance or educational value.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults are referred to the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) for possible&#xD;
      enrollment in clinical protocols for the treatment of cancer or other rare diseases. While&#xD;
      some children are not eligible for a specific protocol, they may present with disease&#xD;
      manifestations that offer the potential for important new insights into the pathogenesis or&#xD;
      clinical behavior of their underlying disease. In addition, children who have completed&#xD;
      participation in a clinical protocol but do not currently have therapeutic protocol&#xD;
      alternatives may continue to provide POB with important information. Diseases of interest to&#xD;
      the POB include, but are not limited to lymphoma, brain tumors, Ewing's sarcoma, leukemia,&#xD;
      neuroectodermal tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, RAS-related syndromes and inherited&#xD;
      immune disorders, amongst others. Hence, serial clinical evaluation of such patients,&#xD;
      including the performance of clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic studies to help elucidate&#xD;
      longitudinally the underlying disease mechanisms, and when clinically indicated standard care&#xD;
      therapies, will assist POB meet its overall mission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be able to follow and evaluate children and adults with cancer or pre-cancer syndromes and&#xD;
      other rare diseases referred to the Pediatric Oncology Branch who present with disease&#xD;
      manifestations that lend themselves to clinical evaluation and are of unique scientific&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are evaluated by the Pediatric Oncology Branch and are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and adults with cancer (or a pre-cancer syndrome or rare disease), with disease&#xD;
           manifestations of special interest to Pediatric Oncology Branch investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 years and less than or equal to 40 years of&#xD;
           age at the time of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical procedures or tests will be selected for each patient on the basis of his/her&#xD;
      individual diagnosis (or presumed diagnosis). When clinically indicated, standard therapy&#xD;
      will be administered and patients will be followed according to standard medical practice.&#xD;
      Specimens may be collected for clinical care purposes only to evaluate the patient s status.&#xD;
      No investigational tests, drugs or therapies will be administered in this protocol.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A POB, CCR investigator decides that it is in the best interest of the patient and the&#xD;
             POB, CCR for the patient to receive treatment and follow-up at the NCI/NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and adults with cancer (or a pre-cancer syndrome or a rare disease), between&#xD;
             the age (s) of 2 years - 40 years (the NIH CC is not well equipped to provide optimal&#xD;
             care to patients &lt; 2 years of age). Note: Patients greater than or equal to 18 and&#xD;
             less than or equal to 40 years may be evaluated on this protocol if their cancer (or&#xD;
             precancer syndrome or rare disease) is of specific interest to the POB, CCR, NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cancer (or a pre-cancer syndrome or rare disease), who present with&#xD;
             disease manifestations of special interest to Pediatric Oncology Branch investigators,&#xD;
             including but not limited to, lymphoma, brain tumors, Ewing's sarcoma, leukemia,&#xD;
             neuroectodermal tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,RAS-related syndromes and&#xD;
             inherited immune disorders, amongst others.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must weigh greater than or equal to 12 kg (the NIH CC is not well equipped to&#xD;

             and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, and when indicated, parent, guardian or LAR who are deemed sufficiently&#xD;
