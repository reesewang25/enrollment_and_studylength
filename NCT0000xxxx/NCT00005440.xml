      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disability among those with asthma is common and costly. Little is known about the causes of&#xD;
      disability in asthma; experience with other chronic diseases suggests that illness severity&#xD;
      alone does not adequately predict disability. There is a theoretical and experimental basis&#xD;
      upon which to postulate that other variables, including factors such as job flexibility,&#xD;
      asthma self-efficacy, social supports, and cigarette smoking may be predictors of disability&#xD;
      in asthma. The study helped to explain the inter-relationships among illness severity, other&#xD;
      co-factors and disability in asthma, addressing a major research gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a cross-sectional survey, including retrospective work history data. A random&#xD;
      sample was conducted of 40 board certified pulmonologists in Northern California enrolling&#xD;
      persons with asthma. Pulmonologists maintained a log of all persons meeting a clinical&#xD;
      definition of asthma presenting to their offices for treatment over a one month period. A&#xD;
      total of 601 subjects with any history of laborforce participation were interviewed by a&#xD;
      trained survey worker in order to assess severity of disease using a severity scale based on&#xD;
      symptoms, medications, and past-asthma history. The computer-assisted, telephone-administered&#xD;
      interviews used established survey instruments to assess psychosocial variables, smoking&#xD;
      exposure and work history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
