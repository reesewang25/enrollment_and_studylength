      To conduct a longitudinal study investigating the physical activity patterns, the&#xD;
      psychosocial predictors of physical activity, and the effects of physical activity changes on&#xD;
      blood pressure and body fatness in a cohort of African-American girls, ages 11-17.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study contributed to an underdeveloped area of research. Physical activity is recommended&#xD;
      as a nonpharmacological means to modify hypertension and obesity, two cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. African-American women have low levels of physical activity and high rates of&#xD;
      obesity, hypertension, and mortality from coronary heart disease, diabetes, and hypertensive&#xD;
      diseases. In 1992, there was an absence of longitudinal data about the physical activity&#xD;
      habits of African-American girls even though a decline in physical activity during&#xD;
      adolescence had been reported in other subpopulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the framework of puberty and maturation, the study: 1) described longitudinal patterns&#xD;
      of physical activity; 2) assessed longitudinal changes in physical activity and concomitant&#xD;
      changes in blood pressure and body fatness; and 3) determined psychosocial predictors of&#xD;
      changes in physical activity. The investigators hypothesized that there would be a monotonic&#xD;
      decrease in physical activity and that psychosocial variables would predict changes in&#xD;
      physical activity. The study population consisted of 189 sixth grade, mostly&#xD;
      African-American, girls in Fort Bend Independent School District, Missouri City, Texas. The&#xD;
      girls were measured for four and a half years, ages 11 or 12 at entry of the study.&#xD;
      Anthropometry, sexual maturation, blood pressure, physical activity habits and psychosocial&#xD;
      predictors were measured twice a year for a total of nine examinations. Data on dietary,&#xD;
      smoking and drinking habits were collected annually. Activity patterns, psychosocial&#xD;
      predictors and other habits were assessed by interviews and questionnaires. Sexual maturation&#xD;
      was assessed by menarche and the Tanner stages. Skinfold and circumference measures&#xD;
      determined body fatness and body fat distribution.&#xD;
