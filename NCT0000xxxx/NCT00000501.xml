      To test the feasibility and the efficacy of nutritional interventions in the primary&#xD;
      prevention of hypertension in individuals predisposed to the development of hypertension;&#xD;
      specifically, to test the hypothesis that reduction of weight and/or decreased sodium intake&#xD;
      in obese individuals, or decreased sodium intake with or without increased potassium intake&#xD;
      (in men and women, regardless of weight) would prevent the elevation of blood pressure and&#xD;
      the incidence of hypertension.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of essential hypertension as a mass public health problem throughout the United&#xD;
      States, and internationally as well, is recognized generally. Prevalence estimates exceed l5&#xD;
      percent in most adult populations. Further, the results of the Hypertension Detection and&#xD;
      Follow-up Program (HDFP) demonstrated the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy even at the&#xD;
      90-l05 mmHg level, which comprises 72 percent of the total hypertensive population. The Joint&#xD;
      National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure&#xD;
      recommended treatment of mild hypertension by pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic therapy to&#xD;
      the lowest diastolic pressure consistent with safety and tolerance. The recommendation was&#xD;
      consonant with the goal blood pressure guidelines for those with baseline pressures from&#xD;
      90-99 mmHg. Hence, there appeared to be a growing consensus that reduction of blood pressure&#xD;
      to levels as low as 80 mmHg might be desirable for optimal cardiovascular health. The Joint&#xD;
      National Committee further recommended that, in young patients with uncomplicated mild&#xD;
      hypertension, the benefits from pharmacologic therapy must be weighed against the cost,&#xD;
      inconvenience, and possible side effects. There was, therefore, a growing concern over the&#xD;
      need for pharmacologic management of hypertension and the public health implications of such&#xD;
      a course of action. These recommendations toward intervention in mild hypertension set a firm&#xD;
      basis for the primary prevention of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between obesity and elevated blood pressure was widely recognized. Among&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals, numerous studies had shown that short term weight reduction by&#xD;
      caloric restriction resulted in a reduction of blood pressure. Results of several reports of&#xD;
      long-term follow-up of weight reduction efforts indicated that long-term control of weight at&#xD;
      levels compatible with the objectives of the HPT was feasible. A number of investigators had&#xD;
      achieved these levels one or more years after treatment despite minimal intervention efforts&#xD;
      during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was strong circumstantial evidence relating sodium intake to hypertension. Most&#xD;
      impressive evidence came from the study of the 'low-salt tribes', subsisting on a very low&#xD;
      sodium intake. They failed to develop hypertension, or even gradual rise of blood pressure&#xD;
      with age. Many studies published on the effect of lowering sodium intake on blood pressure of&#xD;
      hypertensive patients had been positive. In one investigation, blood pressure fell&#xD;
      approximately 9 (systolic)/6 (diastolic) mmHg when sodium intake was reduced from&#xD;
      approximately l80 to l00 mEq/day. Reduction of sodium intake to a level of 70-l00 mEq/day&#xD;
      appeared within the capability of most people and maintenance up to a period of two years had&#xD;
      been indicated with minimal follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of potassium intake in the development and treatment of hypertension was less clear.&#xD;
      As noted above, primitive cultures studied epidemiologically had low sodium intakes&#xD;
      associated with low prevalence and incidence of hypertension but these cultures also consumed&#xD;
      higher levels of potassium. It has been suggested that the ratio of sodium to potassium may&#xD;
      be the most important determinant of blood pressure. Hygienic intervention to increase&#xD;
      potassium intake in free-living populations was the least studied of the procedures used in&#xD;
      the HPT. Potassium intakes &gt; l00 mEq could be achieved without the use of dietary supplements&#xD;
      if individuals consumed large quantities of fruits and vegetables. This natural intake could&#xD;
      also be increased by use of potassium-based baking powder and seasonings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out by four clinical and two resource centers (a Coordinating Center&#xD;
      and a Nutrition and Educational Resource Center). It was to be Phase l of a long-term&#xD;
      intervention trial to determine whether development of hypertension could be prevented in a&#xD;
      population at special risk. The initial phase of the study was directed towards testing the&#xD;
      feasibility of the intervention, alternative modes of recruitment, quantification of sodium&#xD;
      and potassium intake, trends in blood pressure, and the pre-testing of various study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the four clinical centers recruited 200 or more eligible 25 to 49 year old&#xD;
      individuals (total 841), either identified through any of a number of multiple community&#xD;
      sources, or through an index of hypertensive cases. The clinical investigators aided by&#xD;
      statistical and data processing support from the Data Coordinating Center and intervention&#xD;
      support through a special Nutrition and Education Resources Center, formed the collaborative&#xD;
      group to test the working hypothesis. The study protocol was completed in the fall of 1982.&#xD;
      Recruitment ended September 30, 1983. The three-year follow-up period ended August 1986.&#xD;
      Analysis of the data ended in December 1988.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, non-blind design with three treatment groups (non-obese) or five groups&#xD;
      (obese), including a no-treatment group in each weight stratum. Intervention methods were&#xD;
      dietary only, and included sodium restriction, sodium restriction plus potassium&#xD;
      supplementation (obese and non-obese), weight reduction, and weight reduction plus sodium&#xD;
      restriction (obese only). This was a pilot study with measures of feasibility including&#xD;
      recruitment success, dietary adherence, and blood pressure differences among the treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
