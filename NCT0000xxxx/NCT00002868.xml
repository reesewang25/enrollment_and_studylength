      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. Combining interferon alfa with high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interferon alfa with or&#xD;
      without peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have newly diagnosed&#xD;
      chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare overall survival in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in&#xD;
      chronic phase treated with interferon alfa with or without cytarabine vs autologous&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation followed by interferon alfa with or without&#xD;
      cytarabine. II. Compare the time to blast transformation with these treatment regimens in&#xD;
      these patients. III. Compare the number of these patients reverting to Philadelphia&#xD;
      chromosome (Ph) negative hematopoiesis with these treatment regimens. IV. Compare the&#xD;
      complete and major cytogenetic response rates in these patients at one year after receiving&#xD;
      these treatment regimens and annually thereafter. V. Compare the hematological remission rate&#xD;
      in these patients after receiving these treatment regimens. VI. Compare the duration of&#xD;
      hematological remission and its impact on survival and blastic transformation in these&#xD;
      patients after receiving these treatment regimens. VII. Compare the duration of Ph negative&#xD;
      hemapoiesis and its impact on survival and blastic transformation in these patients after&#xD;
      receiving these treatment regimens. VIII. Determine the number of these patients who fail one&#xD;
      treatment regimen and can be rescued with the alternative. IX. Compare quality of life in&#xD;
      these patients with these treatment regimens. X. Determine the number of these patients who&#xD;
      tolerate these two regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo mobilization chemotherapy with a regimen of the&#xD;
      center's choice, such as either of the following: Patients receive idarubicin IV over 10&#xD;
      minutes, etoposide IV over 2 hours, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-3; and&#xD;
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) starting day 11 and continuing until blood counts&#xD;
      recover. OR Patients receive hydroxyurea IV daily until the neutrophil count drops below&#xD;
      1,000/mm3 or the platelet count drops below 20,000/mm3 followed by G-CSF SC for 3 consecutive&#xD;
      days or until leukapheresis is complete. Following mobilization therapy, patients undergo&#xD;
      leukapheresis within 6 months of diagnosis. Patients then undergo cytoreductive therapy&#xD;
      consisting of oral busulfan on days -5 to -2. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are&#xD;
      infused on day 0. Once blood counts have recovered, patients receive interferon alfa SC 3&#xD;
      times a week for 8 weeks, and then daily for at least a total of 6 months or until disease&#xD;
      progression. At the discretion of the treating physician, patients may also receive&#xD;
      cytarabine SC once a day for 10 days each month, beginning 2 weeks after the interferon alfa&#xD;
      therapy begins and continuing until complete cytogenetic response is achieved. Arm II:&#xD;
      Patients receive interferon alfa SC 3 times a week for 4 weeks, and then daily for 6 months.&#xD;
      If hematological remission is achieved after 6 months, interferon treatment is continued for&#xD;
      at least another 6 months or until disease progression. At the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician, patients may also receive cytarabine as in arm I. Quality of life is assessed at&#xD;
      defined intervals. Patients are followed for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 744 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.&#xD;
