      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction in Swedish women below age 60 increased&#xD;
      during the past 20 years. Standard risk factor change includes a decrease in average systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure and S-cholesterol but a moderate increase in smoking and diabetes prevalence.&#xD;
      During the same time period Swedish women have 'moved' into the labor market, so that&#xD;
      employment rates are now similar in Swedish men and women. However, women have kept the main&#xD;
      responsibilities for household and child care. In spite of generous legislation for maternity&#xD;
      leave and child care, the strains from multiple roles and responsibilities have probably&#xD;
      increased in Swedish women. The study sought to provide an answer to: 1) which factors -&#xD;
      biological and behavioral - influenced both the extent of and progress of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, 2) which physiological, biochemical, or neuroendocrine mechanisms participated in&#xD;
      the process. In addition to conventional statistical methods, canonical correlations analyses&#xD;
      were used to describe direct and indirect pathways of the pathogenesis. Furthermore, by means&#xD;
      of the two comparison groups, information was obtained about the specific characteristics of&#xD;
      the female psychosocial and behavioral coronary heart disease risk profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of social strain was studied within a broader psychosocial context including social&#xD;
      networks, social supports, social skills, reciprocity, coping, stressors, chronic work&#xD;
      strain, family structure, personality and behavior characteristics. These aspects were&#xD;
      related to possible physiologic cardiovascular mechanisms including reactivity of and&#xD;
      persistent elevated heart rates and blood pressure on ambulatory monitoring as well as&#xD;
      cardiac dysrhythmia and silent or symptomatic ischemia. Psychoneuroendocrine pathways were&#xD;
      also investigated. These included catecholamines, cortisol, prolactin, estrogen,&#xD;
      testosterone, gastrin, somatostatin. Other biochemical measures included lipid profile,&#xD;
      coagulation, thrombolysis and immune function. These examinations were applied to all women&#xD;
      below age 60, living in the greater Stockholm area, with signs or symptoms of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. The women were followed and reexamined (including angiograms) after 2 to 2.5 years.&#xD;
      They were compared to an equal number of age matched men and to an equal number of age&#xD;
      matched healthy women from the same catchment area.&#xD;
