  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disease affecting African-Americans. About 1 in&#xD;
      every 1000 African-Americans has the disease and 1 in every 12 carry the genes that could be&#xD;
      passed on to their children. People with sickle cell anemia have abnormal hemoglobin, the&#xD;
      molecules responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. The abnormal hemoglobin can cause&#xD;
      damage to the red blood cells. The damaged red blood cell may then stick in the blood vessels&#xD;
      and cause pain and injury to organs. Some of the complications caused by the sticking of&#xD;
      blood cells are called acute pain crisis and acute chest syndrome (ACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that has been proposed as a possible therapy for the ACS&#xD;
      complication of sickle cell anemia. Studies have shown that NO may favorably affect sickle&#xD;
      cell hemoglobin molecules, thereby improving blood flow through small vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the effects of NO, when taken in combination with a drug&#xD;
      called nitroglycerin on patients with sickle cell anemia and normal volunteers. The effects&#xD;
      of these two drugs only last while the patient is receiving them. Researchers hope the&#xD;
      information learned from this study will help to develop new therapies for sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease&#xD;
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis and acute chest&#xD;
      syndrome (ACS) are common complications of sickle cell anemia. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has&#xD;
      been proposed as a possible therapy for the ACS. Anecdotally, NO has been described to&#xD;
      rapidly improve the hypoxemia and the clinical course of the ACS. Furthermore, a number of&#xD;
      recent studies have suggested that NO may have a favorable impact on sickle hemoglobin at the&#xD;
      molecular level and could improve the abnormal microvascular perfusion that is characteristic&#xD;
      of sickle cell anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the physiologic and molecular effects of inhaled&#xD;
      NO and a currently available, safe, FDA-approved medication, nitroglycerin, that is a nitric&#xD;
      oxide donor (i.e., a source of NO after metabolism in the body), in study subjects with and&#xD;
      without sickle cell anemia. Whole blood will be analyzed to characterize the metabolism of NO&#xD;
      and NO donors, the molecular interactions between hemoglobin and NO, the duration of effect&#xD;
      of these therapies on hemoglobin oxygen affinity and other properties of the erythrocyte and&#xD;
      intracellular hemoglobin (including the solubility of deoxy sickle hemoglobin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also plan to characterize the effect of NO delivery on microvascular perfusion in study&#xD;
      subjects with and without sickle cell anemia. Measurements in study subjects will be made&#xD;
      prior to and while receiving either NO, nitroglycerin, or placebo. These perfusion&#xD;
      measurements will occur at rest and during concentric dorsiflexion exercise. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) of lower extremity skeletal muscle enhancement during first passage&#xD;
      of intravenously injected gadolinium contrast will be used to evaluate regional skeletal&#xD;
      muscle perfusion. Perfusion measurements will be paired with a [31]Phosphorus Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Spectroscopy ([31]P-MRS) study of the concentration of muscle high energy phosphate&#xD;
      compounds. Changes in their levels reflect the energy state of muscle and are dependent on&#xD;
      the adequacy of blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow three major assessments: firstly, the characterization of the&#xD;
      microvascular perfusion at rest and during exercise in study subjects with sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia. Secondly, the effects of NO on red cell and hemoglobin function and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      perfusion in normal study subjects (without sickle cell anemia), and finally, the effects of&#xD;
      NO on red cell and hemoglobin function and skeletal muscle perfusion in study subjects with&#xD;
      sickle cell anemia. Our hypothesis is that one or more of these effects could be of potential&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit to sickle cell anemia patients.&#xD;
