      This study will assess the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting heart&#xD;
      attack and heart attack risk in patients who come to the hospital emergency room because of&#xD;
      chest pain. It will also investigate whether MRI can help predict the coronary status of&#xD;
      patients 4 to 6 weeks and 1 year after emergency room admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who come to the emergency room of Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, MD, because of&#xD;
      chest pain may be asked to enroll in this study if they have not been diagnosed as having a&#xD;
      heart attack. Participating patients will undergo a MRI scan as soon as emergency room&#xD;
      doctors determine they are in stable condition. For this procedure, the patient lies on a&#xD;
      table that slides into the MRI scanner-a large tubular machine with a magnetic field. During&#xD;
      the scan, a contrast material is injected into the vein. This material brightens the image of&#xD;
      the heart so that the blood flow can be seen. The scan will show if there are areas of heart&#xD;
      muscle that received insufficient blood flow. A second scan will be done within 72 hours to&#xD;
      look for coronary artery blockage that may require treatment. Patients will be followed by&#xD;
      telephone 4 to 8 weeks after the scans and again 1 year after the scans to ask about any&#xD;
      significant medical problems that may have occurred during those time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information that may improve emergency treatment of patients with&#xD;
      acute chest pain by clarifying which patients require immediate medical treatment, which&#xD;
      should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation, and which may safely be discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States and results&#xD;
      in high diagnostic and therapeutic costs. The overall costs associated with the care of&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular disease is projected to be $286.5 billion. Although MRI is a&#xD;
      relatively expensive technology, this methodology can provide all the noninvasive diagnostic&#xD;
      testing necessary to evaluate and triage patients with coronary artery disease. This &quot;one&#xD;
      stop shop&quot; has the potential to lower overall testing on this important patient population&#xD;
      and better delineate which patients require intervention. Beyond reproducing the results of&#xD;
      existing diagnostic tests, MRI has unique abilities to characterize myocardial tissue adding&#xD;
      information in the assessment of these patients that is not attainable by currently available&#xD;
      methodologies. This study will examine the hypothesis that MRI assessment of regional LV&#xD;
      function, resting myocardial perfusion, and myocardial tissue characteristics can accurately&#xD;
      detect a higher fraction of patients with acute myocardial infarction than is possible with&#xD;
      the ECG performed in the emergency department.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ages above age 21 (children are excluded because myocardial infarction is so rare in this&#xD;
        population that the pre-test probability is comparable to the patients with less than 30&#xD;
        minutes of symptoms. Both of these groups have too small a fraction of true positive events&#xD;
        to benefit from testing with a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 0.85. If&#xD;
        initial results are better, we will reexamine the suitability of these tests for low risk&#xD;
        populations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Capable of giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        30 minutes of chest pain compatible with myocardial ischemia (chest pain score greater than&#xD;
        4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Less than 270 pounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient states she may be pregnant (confirmed by urine or blood testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severe congestive heart failure (unable to lie flat in bed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects on a mechanical ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MRI exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a cardiac pacemaker or implantable defibrillator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a cerebral aneurysm clip.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a neural stimulator (e.g. TENS-Unit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any type of ear implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with metal in eye (e.g. from machining).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with implanted devices (e.g. insulin pump, drug infusion device).&#xD;
