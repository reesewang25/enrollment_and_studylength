  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      FK463, a novel echinocandin (cell wall-active antifungal lipopeptide), as early empirical&#xD;
      therapy for prevention of fungal infections in immunocompromised children. The study is&#xD;
      designed as a multicenter open label, sequential dose escalation study of intravenous FK463.&#xD;
      Intravenous FK463 will be administered daily as an hour infusion to patients with new onset&#xD;
      of fever and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than or equal to 500/mm3) who will&#xD;
      be initiated onto broad spectrum empirical antibacterial therapy. The patient population&#xD;
      consists of children ages 2 to 17 years of age; two age cohorts will be studied (2-12,&#xD;
      13-17). Dosage levels will be 0.5mg/kg/day (not to exceed 25 mg/day), 1.0 mg/kg/day (not to&#xD;
      exceed 50 mg/day), 1.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 75 mg/day) and 2.0mg/kg/day (not to exceed&#xD;
      100mg/day). The planned sample size is 64 patients (a maximum of two replacement patients may&#xD;
      be added to a given dose level and age cohort, for a total of no more than 10 patients per&#xD;
      dose level and age cohort. The study will enroll no more than 80 patients). At each dosage&#xD;
      level, a total of 8 patients will be enrolled into each age cohort (2-12, 13-17); a total of&#xD;
      16 patients will be enrolled into each dosage level. The first group of patients will receive&#xD;
      FK463 at 0.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 25 mg/day). The second group of patients will receive&#xD;
      1.0 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 50mg/day). The third group of patients will receive 1.5&#xD;
      mg/kg/day (not to exceed 75 mg/day). The fourth group of patients will receive 2.0mg/kg/day&#xD;
      (not to exceed 100mg/day). Study drug will continue until recovery from neutropenia (ANC post&#xD;
      nadir greater than or equal 250/mm3) or until the initiation of conventional deoxycholate&#xD;
      amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B for empirical antifungal therapy or&#xD;
      for proven fungal infection. Patients may receive FK463 for a maximum duration of 14 days.&#xD;
      For any patient who meets institutional criteria to start standard empirical antifungal&#xD;
      therapy with conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin&#xD;
      B (greater than 96 hours on study drug) or who has a proven breakthrough fungal infection,&#xD;
      FK463 will be discontinued and conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B or a lipid&#xD;
      formulation of amphotericin B will be initiated.&#xD;

      added to a given dose level and age cohort, for a total of no more than 10 patients per dose&#xD;
      level and age cohort. The study will enroll no more than 120 patients). At each dosage level,&#xD;

      exceed 150 mg/day). The sixth group of patients will receive 4.0 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 200&#xD;
      mg/day). Study drug will continue until recovery from neutropenia (ANC post nadir greater&#xD;
      than or equal 250/mm3) or until the initiation of conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B or&#xD;
      a lipid formulation of amphotericin B for empirical antifungal therapy or for proven fungal&#xD;

      deoxycholate amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (greater than 96 hours&#xD;
      on study drug) or who has a proven breakthrough fungal infection, FK463 will be discontinued&#xD;
      and conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B will be&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
