      RATIONALE: To improve strategies for detection and prevention of early-stage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is collecting specimens and data to develop better methods for&#xD;
      early detection and prevention of ovarian cancer among the high risk population and those who&#xD;
      have the disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and develop highly sensitive and specific tumor markers for the detection&#xD;
           and management of ovarian cancer and other gynecological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify new prevention approaches and therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify measures to improve the quality of life for women at increased risk for&#xD;
           developing the disease and for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Subjects undergo periodic specimen and data collection for research studies,&#xD;
      including molecular, biochemical, functional, and genetic marker studies. Participants may&#xD;
      have samples of blood, tissue, or body fluids (such as ascites, pleural fluid or urine), or&#xD;
      any combination of the aforementioned samples obtained to develop tumor markers to detect&#xD;
      early stage or recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the biomarker research studies will not be reported to the patient or the&#xD;
      physician. In the future, if any of the experimental tumor markers are found to be effective&#xD;
      in detecting early stage ovarian cancer, and the patient's result is abnormal, the patient&#xD;
      and physician will be notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be asked to complete a combination of questionnaires designed to evaluate&#xD;
      psychological functioning among women enrolled in a comprehensive ovarian cancer early&#xD;
      detection program who are at increased risk for developing disease as compared to women&#xD;
      currently diagnosed with ovarian cancer.&#xD;
