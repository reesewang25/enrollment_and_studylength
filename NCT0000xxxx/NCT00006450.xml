  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of treating brain tumors in children&#xD;
      with a continuous infusion of phenylbutyrate. A breakdown product of this drug,&#xD;
      phenylacetate, is normally found in low concentrations in the blood. At much higher&#xD;
      concentrations, phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate are active against cancer in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 2 and 21 years old with a brain tumor that has progressed or recurred after&#xD;
      radiation or chemotherapy, including bone marrow transplant, may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) of the head and, if needed,&#xD;
      a spinal fluid test and bone marrow test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will have a continuous infusion of phenylbutyrate for two 28-day&#xD;
      cycles-every day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The medicine will be infused through a thin&#xD;
      tube (catheter) placed in a large vein in the upper chest, delivered through a portable&#xD;
      infusion pump. Patients will be hospitalized for at least 3 days when the treatment begins.&#xD;
      If there are no side effects at that time, the infusions can continue on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
      The patient or care giver will receive the medicine in 4-day supplies and will be taught how&#xD;
      to change the bag and tubing daily for drug administration, as well as how to use the&#xD;
      infusion pump. Patients will be monitored with weekly blood tests to look for side effects&#xD;
      and measure blood levels of phenylbutyrate. They will have a physical examination at least&#xD;
      once a week. At the end of the second 28-day cycle, patients will have a CT or MRI scan to&#xD;
      evaluate the tumor's response to treatment. Patients whose tumor has grown will stop&#xD;
      treatment and come off the study. Those whose tumor has remained stable or shrunk may&#xD;
      continue phenylbutyrate as long as the treatment is beneficial and there are no serious side&#xD;
      effects. CT or MRI scans will be done after every 2 cycles (or sooner if needed) to evaluate&#xD;
      the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with certain tumor types (medulloblastoma, PNET, ependymoma, malignant germ cell&#xD;
      tumor and pineoblastoma) or who have symptoms that indicate there might be tumor along the&#xD;
      spinal cord may have a spinal tap. For this procedure, the patient lies on the side and a&#xD;
      needle is inserted between two vertebrae (bones of the spine) in the lower back, into the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid space. A sample of fluid is drawn for testing for cancer cells. If the&#xD;
      tumor has spread through the spinal fluid, a spinal tap will be done every other cycle (every&#xD;
      2 months) to monitor the effects of therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenylbutyrate is an aromatic fatty acid that is converted to phenylacetate in vivo by&#xD;
      mitochondrial Beta-oxidation to phenylacetate. Preclinical studies have shown that continuous&#xD;
      exposure to phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate can induce tumor cytostasis and differentiation&#xD;
      in a wide variety of cell lines including malignant gliomas and neuroblastomas. However,&#xD;
      phenylbutyrate has been shown to be a more potent differentiating agent than phenylacetate in&#xD;
      a variety of tumor cell lines. In addition, phenylbutyrate appears to have molecular&#xD;
      activities that are distinct from phenylacetate and may induce apoptosis. Phase I trials in&#xD;
      adults and children have established the feasibility of administering phenylbutyrate on a&#xD;
      prolonged schedule. A phase II trial of phenylbutyrate administered as a continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion will be performed in children with recurrent or progressive brain&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Patients must be between 2 and 21 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologic diagnosis: Previously treated brain tumor patients with any histologic diagnosis&#xD;
        who have recurrent or progressive disease after radiation or chemotherapy, including bone&#xD;
        marrow transplant. For patients with brainstem tumors the requirement for histologic&#xD;
        verification may be waived. However, for patients with brainstem tumors treated with&#xD;
        hyperfractionated radiotherapy a biopsy, a PET scan or NMR spectroscopy is strongly&#xD;
        recommended prior to study entry to rule out radionecrosis as a possible cause of MRI&#xD;
        changes. A biopsy, PET scan, or NMR spectroscopy is required for patients treated with&#xD;
        radiosurgery prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phenylbutyrate will be studied within each of the following disease strata as defined by&#xD;
        the initial tumor histology:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. High grade glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Brainstem glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) present in the&#xD;
             supratentorial or posterior fossa locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiologic evaluation: (must be obtained within two weeks prior to starting therapy)&#xD;
        Patients must have a CT or MRI imaging studies documenting the measurable lesion(s) that&#xD;
        clearly demonstrates the recurrent or progressive nature of the lesion(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recovery from prior therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study and must be without&#xD;
             significant systemic illness (e.g. Infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must not have received myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 weeks (six&#xD;
             weeks if prior nitrosourea) of entry onto this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evaluable lesions must not have had any radiotherapy within 8 weeks, or radiosurgery&#xD;
             within 4 months of the start of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose during the 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life Expectancy: Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance status: For patients older than or equal to 10 years the Karnofsky performance&#xD;
        score must be 50 percent or greater. For children younger than 10 years, the Lansky score&#xD;
        must be 50 percent or greater. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but&#xD;
        who are up in a wheel chair will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of calculating&#xD;
        the performance score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed consent: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is younger than 18&#xD;
        years of age) must sign a document of informed consent indicating their awareness of the&#xD;
        investigational nature and the risks of this study. When appropriate the patient will be&#xD;
        included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematological parameters: (must be obtained within 1 week prior to starting therapy).&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC greater than 1,000/mm(3); platelet&#xD;
        count greater than 50,000/mm(3); hgb greater than 8.0 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with histologic evidence of bone marrow involvement by tumor, or a history of&#xD;
        either bone marrow transplantation or extensive radiotherapy (craniospinal XRT or field&#xD;
        encompassing a region greater than the hemipelvis) will be eligible and for the study but&#xD;
        will be evaluated separately for hematologic toxicity. Transfusion support may be used to&#xD;
        obtain hematologic parameters in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Biochemical parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hepatic Function: Patients must have a bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dl and SGPT less&#xD;
             than 2x normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Renal Function: Patients must have an age-adjusted normal serum creatinine (see below)&#xD;
             or a creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min/1.73m(2) or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;

             normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Central venous access: Patients must be willing to have a central venous access device&#xD;
             (e.g. Broviac or Hickman or Port-a-Cath). An external central venous access device is&#xD;
