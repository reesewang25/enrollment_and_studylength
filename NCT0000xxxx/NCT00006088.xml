      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of&#xD;
      vinorelbine in treating patients who have metastatic or advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of vinorelbine administered intravenously&#xD;
      on day 1 and orally on day 8 vs the reverse order in patients with metastatic or advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. II. Determine the intersubject variability in the pharmacokinetics of oral&#xD;
      vinorelbine. III. Compare the safety profiles of oral vs intravenous vinorelbine in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 20 minutes on day 1 and oral&#xD;
      vinorelbine on day 8. Arm II: Patients receive oral vinorelbine on day 1 and vinorelbine IV&#xD;
      over 20 minutes on day 8. Treatment continues in both arms in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
