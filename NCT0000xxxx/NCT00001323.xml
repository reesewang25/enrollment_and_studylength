  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cognitive processes of participants with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, participants with nervous system and mental disorders, and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undergo cognitive tests of attention, memory, attention.&#xD;
      Participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI), bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be compared with participants with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. A group of healthy adults and children will undergo cognitive tests to further&#xD;
      delineate the degree of impairment in schizophrenia and neurological disorder participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we propose to administer cognitive tests to schizophrenic patients and to&#xD;
      neurologic patients who will serve as contrast groups for neuropsychological studies of&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia. These include studies of Alzheimers disease to dissociate size&#xD;
      and organization of lexicon and ADHD to understand error patterns on CPT-type tests of&#xD;
      attention and vigilance. However, the majority of studies will examine schizophrenia in&#xD;
      relation to normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we propose to obtain test results from a local sample of normal subjects of&#xD;
      varying ages and educational backgrounds to further delineate degree of impairment in these&#xD;
      clinical groups. As well as assessing adults we wish to assess normal children. In&#xD;
      particular, we wish to identify in children the size of their lexicon and their degree of&#xD;
      semantic organization within their lexicon.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        English-speaking adults between ages 21 to 65, in good health and free from significant&#xD;
        substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children between ages 4 to 20 must not have a history of special education, using&#xD;
        psychotropic medication in long-term counseling or with a history of seizures, head injury&#xD;
        or CNS infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal controls will be recruited and screened for exclusionary morbidity by interview&#xD;
        (e.g., no history of contact with mental health professionals, no history of diagnosable&#xD;
        alcohol and/or substance abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal controls will be recruited from building employees, local universities, from NIMH&#xD;
        rosters, and the general public.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded are adults with histories of dementing illness, movement disorder, affective&#xD;
        disorders, developmental and/or acquired brain injury. Diagnoses will be made by review of&#xD;
        medical records, interview, examination, and in the case of psychiatric diagnoses, a&#xD;
        structured interview by SCID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Advertisement will make clear that the subjects will be asked questions about family&#xD;
        psychiatric history and their own history or psychiatric disorder, substance abuse, and&#xD;
        neurological disease. Only if the subject answers these negatively will he or she&#xD;
        participate in this study.&#xD;
