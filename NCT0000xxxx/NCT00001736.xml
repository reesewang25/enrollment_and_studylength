  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new formulation of eye drops used&#xD;
      to treat cystine crystals that form in the corneas of patients with cystinosis. Cystinosis is&#xD;
      an inherited disease caused by a defective enzyme, in which excessive amounts of the amino&#xD;
      acid cystine accumulate in the body. Among others, symptoms include poor growth and&#xD;
      development of kidney failure. In addition, after 10 to 20 years, the cornea-the outside&#xD;
      covering of the eye over the iris and pupils-becomes so packed with cystine crystals that&#xD;
      small, painful breaks may develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This corneal condition is treated with cysteamine eye drops. This study is designed to&#xD;
      provide additional information about this medication that the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      requires before approving it for marketing. The study will examine, in two separate but&#xD;
      simultaneous investigations, the safety and effectiveness of a new cysteamine formulation. In&#xD;
      both studies, before treatment begins, patients will have a complete eye examination, and&#xD;
      photographs of the eye will be taken using a bright flash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults currently enrolled in a cystinosis study at the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health may participate in this trial. They will receive the current cysteamine formulation in&#xD;
      one eye and the new preparation in the other eye. The drops will be given every hour during&#xD;
      waking hours. Patients will be observed daily for the first week of treatment and will be&#xD;
      called at 2 weeks and 4 weeks to check on side effects, if any. At 6 months, they will&#xD;
      undergo a repeat eye examination. Patients (or their parents) will keep a daily diary&#xD;
      recording the condition of each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults from Ann Arbor, Michigan, LaJolla, California, and the NEI clinic may be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Participants will receive medication as described above for the&#xD;
      safety trial. They will be observed daily for the first week and will have repeat eye&#xD;
      examinations, including photographs, at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 to see if the crystals have&#xD;
      decreased. Patients will keep a daily diary of the condition of both eyes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new formulation&#xD;
      of cysteamine eye drops to treat children and adults with cystinosis and cystine crystal&#xD;
      accumulation in the cornea. The safety of this new formulation will be evaluated among 30&#xD;
      children and adults with a history of cystinosis under treatment at the NIH with the current&#xD;
      preparation of cysteamine eye drops. Patients will be randomized to the current preparation&#xD;
      in one eye and the new formulation in the other eye. Vision, blurring, redness, pain,&#xD;
      irritation, and itching will be evaluated in each eye at Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, and Month 6.&#xD;
      Complete ophthalmic evaluation including corneal slit lamp examination with photographs will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline and 6 months at the NEI Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated among 15 patients (5 each from the NEI Clinical Center, Ann Arbor&#xD;
      Michigan, and La Jolla, California) who have not received cysteamine eye drops prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. Patients will be randomized to the current preparation in one eye and the new&#xD;
      formulation in the other eye. Vision, blurring, redness, pain, irritation, and itching will&#xD;
      be evaluated in each eye and a complete ophthalmic assessment including a corneal slit lamp&#xD;
      examination with photographs will be performed at baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, and&#xD;
      Month 12. The primary efficacy outcome measure will be the improvement in the new formulation&#xD;
      treated eye by 1.00 unit on a corneal photograph scale from 0.00 to 3.00 in 0.25 increments&#xD;
      compared to the baseline grade. This scale grades the density and number of crystals in the&#xD;
      cornea. The safety and efficacy studies will be conducted concurrently.&#xD;
