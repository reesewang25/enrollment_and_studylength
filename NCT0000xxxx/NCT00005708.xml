      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was in response to a demonstration and education initiative, &quot;Improving&#xD;
      Hypertensive Care for Inner City Minorities&quot;, which was reviewed and approved by the Clinical&#xD;
      Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee in April 1992 and by the National Heart, Lung,&#xD;
      and Blood Advisory Council in May 1992. The Request for Applications was released in October&#xD;
      1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An aggressive Hypertension Intervention Project (HIP) was developed in the Hypertension&#xD;
      Research Section of King/Drew Medical Center in South-Central Los Angeles. The private CHUER&#xD;
      clinic (located in the same cachement area) subcontracted with the Drew University Center in&#xD;
      a community coalition consisting of several large health advocacy organizations. All subjects&#xD;
      were randomized into usual care (controls) or interventional care (experimental) at the&#xD;
      initiation of the HIP. The cornerstone of the aggressive intervention was the development of&#xD;
      a computerized patient tracking system and the introduction into the clinic of several&#xD;
      educational activities including a) exit interviews; b) home visits; c) support group&#xD;
      sessions, and d) community health seminars/fairs. Community Health Workers performed the bulk&#xD;
      of the patient tracking and educational intervention field work. Outcome measures of pre and&#xD;
      post-study blood pressure, renal function, body weight change, and all-cause mortality were&#xD;
      compared between experimental and controls at two, three and four years into the study.&#xD;
      Quality-of-life questionnaires were obtained pre- and post-study and analyzed for new&#xD;
      insights into needs assessment, awareness of hypertension, attitudes towards treatment,&#xD;
      compliance with drug therapy, and effectiveness of various educational interventions employed&#xD;
      in the study. Concurrent efforts to reduce co-morbid risk factors such as obesity, cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and stress were assessed as secondary outcomes. The&#xD;
      HIP hoped to demonstrate cost-effective innovations for the adaptation of these Medical&#xD;
      Center-targeted strategies to community physicians and health clinics of the inner city.&#xD;
