  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant brain tumors are responsible for a significant amount of deaths in children and&#xD;
      adults. Even with advances in surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, many patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor survive only months to weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to improve the prognosis for these patients, researchers have developed a new&#xD;
      approach to brain tumor therapy. This approach makes use of DNA technology to transfer genes&#xD;
      sensitive to therapy into the cells of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections with the herpes simplex virus can cause cold sores in the area of the mouth. A&#xD;
      drug called ganciclovir (Cytovene) can kill the virus. Ganciclovir is effective because the&#xD;
      herpes virus contains a gene (Herpes-Thymidine Kinase TK gene) that is sensitive to the drug.&#xD;
      Researchers have been able to separate this gene from the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using DNA technology, researchers hope to transfer and implant the TK gene into tumor cells&#xD;
      making them sensitive to ganciclovir. In theory, giving patients ganciclovir will kill all&#xD;
      tumor cells that have the TK gene incorporated into them.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malignant brain tumors are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in both&#xD;
      pediatric and adult populations. These common tumors present an enormous therapeutic&#xD;
      challenge due to their poor outcome despite radical surgery, high dose radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Survival of patients from the time of diagnosis is measured in months and&#xD;
      recurrence after treatment is associated with a life expectancy of weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to improve this grim prognosis of patients with malignant brain tumors (both&#xD;
      primary tumors and secondary metastasis from systemic cancer such as melanoma, lung and&#xD;
      breast cancer), we developed a novel approach to the therapy of brain tumors. This approach&#xD;
      makes use of recombinant DNA technology to transfer a sensitivity gene into a brain tumor.&#xD;
      This is achieved by direct injection of the tumor with a cell line actively producing a&#xD;
      retroviral vector carrying a gene conferring drug sensitivity to the tumor. A retroviral&#xD;
      vector is a mouse retrovirus genetically engineered to replace its own genes with a new gene.&#xD;
      Such vectors are capable of &quot;infecting&quot; mammalian cells and stably incorporate their new&#xD;
      genetic material into the genome of the infected host. The producer cell is an NIH 3T3 cell&#xD;
      that has been genetically engineered to continually produce retroviral vectors. The new gene&#xD;
      is incorporated into the genome of the tumor cells and expresses the protein which is encoded&#xD;
      by the new gene. This protein (the herpes simplex virus enzyme thymidine kinase, HS-tk)&#xD;
      sensitizes the tumor cells to an antiviral drug (ganciclovir, GCV) which is a natural&#xD;
      substrate for HS-tk. The enzymatic process induced by GCV leads to death of a natural&#xD;
      substrate for HS-tk. The enzymatic process induced by GCV leads to death of the cell&#xD;
      expressing the herpes TK activity, i.e., death of the tumor cells. Since the HS-tk enzyme&#xD;
      which is normally present in mammalian cells has very low affinity for GCV, systemic toxicity&#xD;
      related to this mechanism is not observed. This type of in vivo gene transfer has several&#xD;
      unique features. First, these retroviral-vectors will only integrate and express their genes&#xD;
      in cells which are actively synthesizing DNA. Therefore, surrounding non-proliferating normal&#xD;
      brain tissue should not acquire the HS-tk gene and will remain insensitive to GCV. Second,&#xD;
      all of the transduced tumor cells (and retroviral vector producing cells) will be killed by&#xD;
      the host immune response and/or GCV treatment eliminating potential concern about insertional&#xD;
      mutagenesis giving rise to malignant cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first clinical attempt to treat malignant tumors in human beings by in-vivo&#xD;
      genetic manipulation of tumor's genome.&#xD;
