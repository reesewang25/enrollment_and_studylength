      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hundred-forty children, 6 to 17 years of age, were recruited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Following the collection of baseline data, all families in the study received standard&#xD;
      environmental control education prior to randomization to the control or experimental group.&#xD;
      This education provided parents and children with information about such topics as the&#xD;
      child's sensitivity profile, the relationship between exposure to allergens and asthma, and&#xD;
      the risks of passive smoking. All families were given information on how to receive&#xD;
      environmental control aids and services available by mail at no or reduced costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once families were randomized, those in the control group received no additional&#xD;
      intervention. Those in the experimental group received a home-based allergen control&#xD;
      intervention delivered by trained environmental counselors. Primary outcomes were changes in&#xD;
      asthma-related quality of life and changes in targeted allergen levels in the home. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures included self-efficacy for environmental allergy control, FEV1, and&#xD;
      parent-reported health care utilization.&#xD;
