  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn how tumors of the upper airway and digestive passages&#xD;
      (tongue, throat, mouth, and voicebox) affect the body's immune defenses and energy storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that tumors of the vocal tract produce signals that could help&#xD;
      the tumor escape the body's immune defenses and use the body's energy and mineral stores to&#xD;
      grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are hoping to learn more about what signals give tumor cells an advantage to live&#xD;
      and grow, how tumor cells control these signals, and how these signals affect the rest of the&#xD;
      body. This study will look closer at researchers belief that tumors in the vocal tract&#xD;
      contain genes (genetic information) that abnormally function to allow the tumors to survive&#xD;
      and grow against the attack of the body's normal immune system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cancerous tumors (squamous cell carcinoma) and benign (non-cancerous) tumors&#xD;
      (papilloma) of the upper aerodigestive tract who are candidates for standard or&#xD;
      investigational therapy are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor cells will be collected from patients participating in the study, who will undergo&#xD;
      standard surgical treatment or biopsies for their conditions. Once tumor cells are collected&#xD;
      they can be analyzed for their genetic make-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will undergo several tests using skin, blood, and urine to look closely&#xD;
      at the function of their immune systems and metabolism.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with squamous cell carcinoma or papilloma of the upper aerodigestive tract who are&#xD;
      candidates for standard or investigational therapy are eligible to participate in this pilot&#xD;
      immunopathogenesis study. Patients with these neoplasms exhibit alterations in immune and&#xD;
      metabolic regulation. These alterations in immunoregulation have been shown to affect&#xD;
      prognosis, and have thus far been an obstacle to the successful development of active&#xD;
      immunization and cytokine immunotherapy that have been attempted in order to improve&#xD;
      preservation of organ function and survival. This is a pilot study to explore the basis for&#xD;
      alterations in immune and metabolic regulation in patients with these tumors. Similar&#xD;
      alterations in immunity and metabolism usually occur in response to injury and infection, and&#xD;
      are mediated by expression of immunoregulatory signals. The study will evaluate the&#xD;
      hypothesis that regulatory and structural genes involved in immunoregulation are abnormally&#xD;
      expressed within the tumor and that these signals can promote tumor development and&#xD;
      progression by conferring a selective growth or survival advantage. The expression and&#xD;
      activity of immunoregulatory genes and signals which are expressed by neoplastic or&#xD;
      non-neoplastic cells within the tumor will be analyzed using tumor cells and leukocytes&#xD;
      derived from patient specimens obtained during clinically indicated biopsies or surgical&#xD;
      therapy. Tumor and keratinocyte cell lines will be established for analysis of differential&#xD;
      gene and cytokine expression of neoplastic cells, and lymphocyte cell lines will be&#xD;
      established to test culture and signal conditions for stimulating regulatory and effector&#xD;
      immune responses of patient lymphocytes in vitro. The potential of factors identified to&#xD;
      promote altered immune and metabolic function will be evaluated in the patients by skin,&#xD;
      blood and urine immune and metabolic assays performed before and after tumor resection or&#xD;
      cytoreduction. Patients participating in these investigations would be expected to benefit&#xD;
      from receipt of standard therapy and would encumber minimal additional risk beyond those&#xD;
      procedures for the standard or investigational therapy for which the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      consent. Twenty patients each with squamous cell carcinoma and papilloma will be accepted to&#xD;
      undergo standard therapy under this protocol, and twenty patients may be accepted for study&#xD;
      while undergoing therapy on other approved investigational protocol(s). Twenty age-matched&#xD;
      clinical research volunteers will be evaluated as control subjects for the skin, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests.&#xD;
