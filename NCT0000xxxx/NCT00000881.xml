      Part A: To determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of sequential single doses of cidofovir&#xD;
      in HIV-infected children with end-organ cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. Part B: To determine&#xD;
      the safety (including time to progression of CMV retinitis by retinal exam),&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and long-term (6 months) tolerance of multiple-dose cidofovir in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children with CMV retinitis. Part B: To determine the effect of multiple-dose&#xD;
      cidofovir on the virologic parameters of CMV retinitis (viral load, shedding, and resistance&#xD;
      to antiviral agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/7/98: To determine the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      sequential single doses of cidofovir in HIV-infected children with CMV retinitis. To&#xD;
      determine the safety (including time to progression of CMV retinitis by retinal exam),&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and long-term (6-month) tolerance of multiple doses of cidofovir in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children with CMV retinitis.] While the intravenous formulation of cidofovir has&#xD;
      been approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected individuals, information is&#xD;
      limited regarding its safety and tolerance in HIV-infected children. Intravenous cidofovir&#xD;
      requires less frequent administration for both induction and maintenance therapy of CMV&#xD;
      retinitis than other currently available therapies. If found to be safe and well tolerated in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children with CMV retinitis, intravenous cidofovir would add significantly to&#xD;
      agents available to treat this debilitating opportunistic infection.&#xD;

      While the intravenous formulation of cidofovir has been approved for the treatment of CMV&#xD;
      retinitis in HIV-infected individuals, information is limited regarding its safety and&#xD;
      tolerance in HIV-infected children. Intravenous cidofovir requires less frequent&#xD;
      administration for both induction and maintenance therapy of CMV retinitis than other&#xD;
      currently available therapies. If found to be safe and well tolerated in HIV-infected&#xD;
      children with CMV retinitis, intravenous cidofovir would add significantly to agents&#xD;
      available to treat this debilitating opportunistic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this two-part study, patients are stratified by age (3 months to &lt; 2 years versus 2 years&#xD;
      to &lt; 13 years). In Part A, 8 patients (4 per cohort) receive a single intravenous dose of&#xD;
      cidofovir with concurrent probenecid. If 1 patient in a cohort experiences life-threatening&#xD;
      grade 3/4 toxicity, accrual for that cohort is stopped. If 1 patient in a cohort experiences&#xD;
      non-life-threatening grade 3/4 toxicity, 2 additional patients are entered in that cohort. A&#xD;
      second dose of cidofovir may be studied in Part A based on the pharmacokinetic and safety&#xD;
      data obtained with the initial dose. Patients who complete Part A of the study without&#xD;
      serious toxicity may be treated in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, 12 patients (8 in the older cohort and 4 in the younger cohort) receive&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with cidofovir at the dose established in Part A. Patients who complete 6&#xD;
      months of treatment in Part B may continue therapy until all patients have completed the&#xD;
      study. NOTE: For patients who require induction or reinduction, cidofovir is given weekly for&#xD;
      2 weeks before initiating the Part B regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/7/98: Each subject receives sequential single doses of intravenous&#xD;
      cidofovir, with a 2-week interval between doses and with concurrent probenecid. If the single&#xD;
      doses prove safe and well tolerated and individual pharmacokinetic profiles are acceptable,&#xD;
      subjects proceed to multi-dosing cidofovir given every 2 weeks for 6 months beginning 14-21&#xD;
      days after the second single dose. Subjects remain on intravenous or oral ganciclovir for&#xD;
      treatment of CMV retinitis until they enter the multi-dosing phase of the study. Subjects who&#xD;
      require reinduction during the multi-dosing phase receive intravenous cidofovir once weekly&#xD;
      for 2 weeks before resuming the every-2-weeks regimen. Patients are stratified by age (3&#xD;
      months to &lt; 2 years vs. 2 years to &lt; 13 years), with 4 patients entered in the younger cohort&#xD;
      and 8 in the older. In the younger age cohort, if 1 patient experiences life- or&#xD;
      vision-threatening grade 3/4 toxicity or 2 experience non-life-threatening grade 3/4&#xD;
      toxicity, the age cohort will stop. If 1 patient experiences non-life-threatening grade 3/4&#xD;
      toxicity, 2 additional patients will be enrolled in this age cohort. In the older age cohort,&#xD;
      if 1 patient experiences severe life- or vision-threatening toxicity or 2 experience serious,&#xD;
      non-life-threatening toxicities, enrollment for both cohorts will be suspended while safety&#xD;
      data are reviewed. If 2 of the 8 patients experience severe, non-life-threatening toxicity,&#xD;
      enrollment may continue.]&#xD;
