      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not&#xD;
      yet known if mitoxantrone and prednisone are more effective with or without leflunomide for&#xD;
      treating prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to compare the effectiveness of mitoxantrone and&#xD;
      prednisone with or without leflunomide in treating patients who have stage IV prostate cancer&#xD;
      that has not responded to hormone therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the percentage one year survival rate in hormone refractory prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients treated with leflunomide (SU101), mitoxantrone, and prednisone versus&#xD;
      mitoxantrone and prednisone alone. II. Compare the palliative pain response, time to&#xD;
      treatment failure, time to progression, median survival, investigator global response&#xD;
      assessment, objective response, time to palliative pain response, duration of palliation, and&#xD;
      effect on PSA between these two regimens. III. Assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      mitoxantrone in combination with SU101 in these patients. IV. Assess the health related&#xD;
      quality of life of these patients on these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by&#xD;
      performance status (70-80% vs 90-100%), baseline present pain intensity score (2.0 vs greater&#xD;
      than 2.0), and hemoglobin level (less than 12.0 g/dL vs at least 12.0 g/dL). Patients enter&#xD;
      one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients are premedicated with an IV 5-HT3 reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitor (i.e., odansetron) then receive mitoxantrone IV on day 1. Twice daily oral&#xD;
      prednisone therapy begins on day 1 and continues throughout study treatment. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Arm II: Patients are premedicated with an IV 5-HT3&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor as in arm I. Patients receive mitoxantrone and prednisone therapy as in&#xD;
      arm I. Additionally, beginning on day 1 patients receive leflunomide (SU101) IV over 4-5&#xD;
      hours weekly for 12 weeks. The SU101 infusions shall precede mitoxantrone infusions. Patients&#xD;
      receive a maximum of one year therapy with SU101; mitoxantrone therapy may be administered up&#xD;
      to a maximum dose of 140/m2. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 8, day 21, and then&#xD;
      every 3 weeks thereafter until study completion. Patients are followed at least every 2&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 370 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
