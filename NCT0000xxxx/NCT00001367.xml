      This protocol is a screening and natural history protocol, which allows for evaluation of&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients and families where neurological conditions are present for enrollment into other&#xD;
&#xD;
      studies and will also be used to screen healthy volunteers to create a pool of potential&#xD;
      future HV matches for HMCS protocols. Through diagnostic evaluations, data will be collected&#xD;
      for research use in this study.&#xD;

    <sharing_ipd>Undecided</sharing_ipd>
    <ipd_description>.This protocol was written before creating sharing plans was required. We do share data with other protocols done by our group to avoid having to repeat procedures, but there is no official &quot;research&quot; done in this protocol, so it is unlikely that we will need to share any IPD elsewhere. If there is, we will consider it on a case-by-case basis.</ipd_description>
