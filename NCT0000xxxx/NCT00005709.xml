      To study relationships among lipoprotein metabolism, hypertension, and&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia-insulin resistance in African American males and females. The study was part&#xD;
      of a Collaborative Project on Minority Health which investigated the mechanisms by which&#xD;
      insulin contributes to cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of the initiative &quot;Collaborative Projects (R01s) on Minority Health&quot;. The&#xD;
      concept for the initiative was developed by the NHLBI staff after the 1993 Report of the&#xD;
      Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, encouraged the NHLBI to establish&#xD;
      minority centers to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The&#xD;
      initiative was approved at the September 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory&#xD;
      Council and released in October 1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Julian Marsh was one of three investigators in a collaborative program with Bonita Falkner as&#xD;
      Program Coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sub-set of subjects with either high or low plasma insulin levels after a glucose&#xD;
      challenge (insulin sensitive or insulin resistant), the investigators determined the&#xD;
      fractional and absolute synthesis and catabolic rates of apolipoproteins B and A-I, the&#xD;
      dominant lipoproteins of Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL).&#xD;
      They used stable isotopes and multicompartmental kinetic analysis following an oral bolus&#xD;
      dose of deuteroleucine. They hypothesized that in hypertensive African Americans with&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia, more of the smaller Very Low Density (VLDL) particles are secreted and&#xD;
      converted to LDL.&#xD;
