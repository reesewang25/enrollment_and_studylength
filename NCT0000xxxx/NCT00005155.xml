      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Type A behavior pattern as described by Friedman and Rosenman is characterized by&#xD;
      extremes of competitiveness, easily aroused hostility, a sense of urgency and aggression. In&#xD;
      1981 the Review Panel of Coronary Prone Behavior and Coronary Heart Disease concluded that&#xD;
      the Type A behavior pattern was associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease.&#xD;
      Studies have challenged the independent predictive value of the behavior pattern with respect&#xD;
      to coronary heart disease. There was a need to develop physiological measurements related to&#xD;
      coronary-prone behavior and to reexamine the stability of the psychological assessment. It&#xD;
      was hypothesized that Type A behavior or some component such as hostility might be associated&#xD;
      with a state of chronic, generalized sympathetic-adrenal arousal. Preliminary research was&#xD;
      conducted on interpersonal dynamic correlates of Type A behavior among married couples.&#xD;
      Research was needed on whether certain types of marriages, according to the Type A/B&#xD;
      classification of the two spouses, are more pathogenic than others. Additional research is&#xD;
      also needed on which components of the global Type A pattern were of primary importance as&#xD;
      risk factors for coronary disease, and which components were enduring, which were transient,&#xD;
      and which were situationally related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1982, a household survey on Type A behavior was initiated. Measures included the Jenkins&#xD;
      Activity Survey, the Framingham Type A Questionnaire, hostility scales, and other behavioral&#xD;
      tests. Information was also collected on demographic variables, social support, marital&#xD;
      satisfaction, life events, social values, and job and family stress. After the household&#xD;
      survey was completed, the respondents were contacted by the Type A interviewers and the&#xD;
      Structured Interviews conducted. A total of 1,114 Type A interviews were completed yielding&#xD;
      902 primary respondents and 239 spouses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concurrent relationship of the Structured Interview (SI) global and component Type A&#xD;
      behavior measures were tested to levels of chronic and acute sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      activity, as assessed by platelet and plasma catecholamines, heart rate, blood pressure, and&#xD;
      pupil size. The correlations among heart rate, pupil size, blood pressure, and the plasma and&#xD;
      platelet catecholamine measures were determined as were the relationships with reported&#xD;
      global health, chronic disease, and functional disability levels. The five-year&#xD;
      predictability was tested of reported global health, chronic disease, and functional&#xD;
      disability from measures of global and component Type A behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests were made of the differences in the chronic and acute sympathetic-adrenal responses, as&#xD;
      assessed by platelet and plasma catecholamines, pupil size, heart rate, and blood pressure,&#xD;
      among married couples having different combinations of Structured Interview global and&#xD;
      component Type A classifications. The five year marital stability and health of these couples&#xD;
      were followed. A comparison was made of one week test-retest reliability with the five year&#xD;
      stability of the Structured Interview global and component Type A measures.&#xD;
