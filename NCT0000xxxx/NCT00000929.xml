  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and acceptable for homosexual male couples,&#xD;
      where both partners have the same HIV status, to use Advantage 24 during anal intercourse.&#xD;
      Advantage 24 is a spermicide (a chemical that kills sperm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much research and development is being done with chemicals that can be controlled by the&#xD;
      receptive partner to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases&#xD;
      (STDs). Advantage 24 currently is used in the vagina as a form of birth control. The safety&#xD;
      of Advantage 24 is particularly important for HIV-positive men because they have a greater&#xD;
      chance of serious reaction to Advantage 24 due to other HIV-related conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemical barriers which can be controlled by the receptive partner to prevent transmission of&#xD;
      HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are among the highest priorities for&#xD;
      research and development. Advantage 24 is a contraceptive gel containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9).&#xD;
      This study provides information on the safety of N-9 in a bioadhesive gel formulated for use&#xD;
      by MSM during anal intercourse. Safety is assessed for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative men&#xD;
      because HIV-positive men may be at increased risk for toxicity due to other HIV-related&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are divided into 4 cohorts depending on their serostatus and whether they are&#xD;
      the insertive or receptive partner. Participants apply Advantage 24 once or twice a day for 5&#xD;
      weeks and 4 times a day for the sixth week. Check-in visits, which include a genital exam,&#xD;
      are performed at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. More complete physical evaluations, including&#xD;
      anoscopy for receptive partners and blood tests, are performed at Weeks 3, 6, and 8.&#xD;
