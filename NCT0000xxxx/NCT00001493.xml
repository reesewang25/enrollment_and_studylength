  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility of using gene therapy to prevent some of the toxicities&#xD;
      of an intensive chemotherapy regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients who&#xD;
      do not wish to participate in the gene therapy procedures will be offered identical&#xD;
      chemotherapy on a different protocol. Patients will be treated initially with chemotherapy&#xD;
      which is active against breast cancer, but which has a low potential to hurt blood-forming&#xD;
      cells. Then, the patient will receive high dose chemotherapy, during which time blood cells&#xD;
      which are capable of rebuilding patients' bone marrows will be removed from the patients'&#xD;
      bloodstream. We will use these blood cell collections to isolate peripheral blood progenitor&#xD;
      cells (PBPCs), those cells which are thought to be the forbears of all other blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of the PBPCs will be exposed to a disabled virus which either carries genetic&#xD;
      material referred to as the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1). The virus will transfer the&#xD;
      MDR1 gene into a portion of the patient's PBPCs. The purpose of putting the MDR1 gene into&#xD;
      the patients' PBPCs is to try to make these blood cells and their offspring resistant to the&#xD;
      toxic effects of certain types of breast cancer chemotherapy. The MDR1 protein (Pgp) that is&#xD;
      made from the MDR1 gene makes cells resistant to chemotherapy in laboratory systems by&#xD;
      pumping the drug out of cells before the drug is able to kill the cell. Another portion of&#xD;
      the patients PBPCs will be exposed to a similar disabled virus carrying a different gene&#xD;
      called the NeoR gene. The NeoR gene should not change the effects of chemotherapy on blood&#xD;
      forming cells. The purpose of using the NeoR gene is that it will serve as a point of&#xD;
      comparison, to see if the presence of the MDR1 drug resistance gene really helps blood&#xD;
      forming cells withstand subsequent chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are then treated with a very high dose of another anti-breast cancer drug, one that&#xD;
      is very toxic to bone marrow cells, and patients will then receive the frozen PBPCs, which&#xD;
      contain the new genes, to help them recover from the chemotherapy. After recovery, patients&#xD;
      will then be treated with high doses of paclitaxel (Taxol) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin)&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Both of these drugs are very active against breast cancer, and the MDR1 gene&#xD;
      may potentially protect bone marrow cells against these drugs. Samples of peripheral blood&#xD;
      cells will be obtained before each of these doses of chemotherapy to determine whether the&#xD;
      number of blood cells that contain the MDR1 gene in comparison to the number that contain the&#xD;
      NeoR gene has increased in response to the chemotherapy.&#xD;

      This pilot trial will determine whether retroviral-transduced peripheral blood progenitor&#xD;
      cells (PBPCs) can be selected and expanded in vivo after non-ablative chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic breast cancer. It will also examine the feasibility of administering&#xD;
      induction high-dose therapy with antimetabolites, followed with consolidation using high-dose&#xD;
      single alkylating agent therapy and finally intensification therapy with sequential cycles of&#xD;
      very high doses of the natural product breast cancer chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel&#xD;
      followed by doxorubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive induction therapy with antimetabolite agents (methotrexate, leucovorin&#xD;
      and 5-fluorouracil) for two to four cycles. Patients will then receive consolidation therapy&#xD;
      with two cycles of high-dose alkylating agents. First, patients will receive one cycle of&#xD;
      high-dose cyclophosphamide administered with growth factor support. PBPCs will be harvested&#xD;
      during the recovery phase of the cyclophosphamide cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-half of the cells to be reinfused will be transduced with a retroviral vector containing&#xD;
      the gene for the multidrug resistance protein (MDRI in vector G1MD) and the other half will&#xD;
      be transduced with a vector containing the neomycin resistance gene (NeoR in vector G1Na.40).&#xD;
      Both of these vectors have previously been approved by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee&#xD;
      for PBPC transduction in Medicine Branch protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next cycle will consist of high-dose single agent thiotepa. Hematopoietic stem cells&#xD;
      mobilized and collected during the previous cyclophosphamide cycle and transduced with the&#xD;
      retroviral vectors will be reinfused following treatment with thiotepa to augment recovery of&#xD;
      bone marrow function. After recovery, intensification with natural product chemotherapy will&#xD;
      be administered, consisting of four cycles of paclitaxel given as a 24-hour infusion followed&#xD;
      by four cycles of single agent doxorubicin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be&#xD;
      monitored following each cycle of paclitaxel and doxorubicin for the presence of the MDRI and&#xD;
      NeoR transgenes. The ration of the levels of MDRI to NeoR transgenes in peripheral blood will&#xD;
      determine whether in vivo expansion of the PBPCs containing the selectable MDRI marker has&#xD;
      been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol combines several highly active chemotherapeutic agents in an attempt to improve&#xD;
      upon response rates achieved with current combinations. Patients who do not wish to&#xD;
      participate in the gene therapy procedures will be offered identical chemotherapy in a&#xD;
      different protocol.&#xD;
