  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will investigate the effects of a high-impact exercise program involving&#xD;
      jumping on bone mass (the amount of bone) of the hip and backbone in the growing skeleton. We&#xD;
      will also look at the effects of gradually stopping the jumping program on bone mass in the&#xD;
      growing skeleton. A high-impact exercise program may build more bone during childhood, while&#xD;
      the skeleton is still growing. This may help prevent broken bones due to loss of bone mass&#xD;
      later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 200 children aged 5-10 to participate in the study. For 6 months we will&#xD;
      train the children in either a jumping or stretching program. We will then gradually reduce&#xD;
      the amount of exercise over 6 months. We will measure bone mass in the hip and backbone at&#xD;
      the start of the study, after jumping, and 6 months after the jumping program is stopped. We&#xD;
      will compare the results in the jumping and stretching groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporotic fractures are increasing at an alarming rate in this country and result in over&#xD;
      13 billion dollars in health costs annually. Peak bone mass, that is, an individual's maximum&#xD;
      bone mass at the completion of skeletal acquisition, is an important determinant of fracture&#xD;
      risk. Thus, maximizing peak bone mass may provide an effective strategy for preventing&#xD;
      osteopenia and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various investigators have postulated that increasing bone mass by 3-5 percent would reduce&#xD;
      fracture risk by 20-30 percent. Our data in collegiate female gymnasts demonstrate hip and&#xD;
      spine bone mineral density values of up to 40 percent above values in normal age-matched&#xD;
      controls and elite runners, despite menstrual irregularities. Further, we have observed the&#xD;
      dynamic response of bone to high-impact forces in gymnasts over the training season as bone&#xD;
      increases of 2-5 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, controlled exercise intervention designed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      high-impact loading as a means to increase bone mass during development. It will determine&#xD;
      bone mass accrual and bone geometry at the lumbar spine and proximal femur in prepubescent&#xD;
      girls and boys. Further, this study will evaluate the bone response from withdrawal of the&#xD;
      stimulus over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 200 pre-pubescent children during two separate years and randomly assign them&#xD;
      to a jumping or a stretching group. The jumping group will perform double leg jumps and the&#xD;
      stretching group will act as a control. Outcome variables include bone mineral density (BMD)&#xD;
      at the spine and hip, estimated bone volumetric density at the spine, and cross-sectional&#xD;
      geometry of the femoral neck and diaphysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing a specific bone-loading program during childhood will potentially allow the bone&#xD;
      to increase both its mass and mineralization at an earlier age and therefore provide a larger&#xD;
      foundation of mineralization for further growth throughout adolescence until skeletal&#xD;
      maturity is reached. We expect our findings to provide a basis for the design of strategies&#xD;
      to build bone during growth and thereby reduce osteoporotic fractures.&#xD;
