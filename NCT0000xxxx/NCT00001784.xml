  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia refers to a condition characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that may&#xD;
      cause pain, abnormal posture, or abnormal movements. The cause of dystonia is unknown, but&#xD;
      some researchers believe it is a result of overactivity in the areas of the brain responsible&#xD;
      for movement (basal ganglia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine is a drug used for the treatment of irregular heartbeats. It is given by injection.&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that lidocaine is also effective for the treatment dystonia.&#xD;
      Mexiletine is a drug similar to lidocaine used for irregular heartbeats that can be taken by&#xD;
      mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers would like to test the effectiveness of Mexiletine for the treatment of dystonia.&#xD;
      Patients participating in the study will be divided into two groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will take Mexiletine for six weeks then stop. They will remain drug free for one week&#xD;
      then begin taking a placebo &quot;inactive sugar pill&quot; for an additional six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will take a placebo &quot;inactive sugar pill&quot; for six weeks then stop. They will remain&#xD;
      drug free for one week then begin taking a Mexiletine for an additional six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study researchers will test the effectiveness of the treatment by evaluating&#xD;
      patients using clinical rating scales and neurophysiological studies. In addition,&#xD;
      researchers will test patient's reflexes in an attempt to find out where mexiletine works in&#xD;
      the nervous system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a complex neurological disorder with an unknown pathogenesis likely involving the&#xD;
      basal ganglia. There is no adequate treatment for dystonia. Recent studies using&#xD;
      intramuscular and intravenous lidocaine have shown improvement in dystonic movements. It has&#xD;
      been proposed that patients with dystonia have reduced presynaptic inhibition of alpha&#xD;
      motoneurons leading to overactivation in response to movement. This may also reflect a&#xD;
      hyperexcitability at the cortical level, which can be reduced by altering peripheral input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mexiletine, an antiarrhythmic similar to lidocaine, but available orally, may benefit&#xD;
      patients with dystonia, as has been shown in several recent open-label studies. This trial&#xD;
      offers the possibility of treating dystonia as well as further elucidating the level of&#xD;
      dysfunction in the nervous system in dystonic patients. We propose a double-blind cross over&#xD;
      study comparing mexiletine to placebo in the treatment of patients with idiopathic dystonia.&#xD;
      The patients will be evaluated by clinical rating scales as well as neurophysiological&#xD;
      studies. In order to study the physiologic effect and attempt to localize the neuroanatomic&#xD;
      sight of action of mexiletine, studies of peripheral reflexes, reciprocal inhibition and&#xD;
      cortical excitation will be performed. These studies will include blink reflex recovery&#xD;
      curves, tonic vibration reflex, H-reflex and transcranial magnetic stimulation.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with focal dystonia, specifically writer's cramp and blepharospasm, will be&#xD;
        eligible for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will need medical clearance, specifically, cardiac clearance, by their primary&#xD;
        care physician. This will include an EKG within the past 12 months and no history of&#xD;
        underlying cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following conditions will be excluded from the study: structural&#xD;
        brain lesions, identifiable etiology for dystonia (such as stroke, trauma, Parkinson's&#xD;
        Disease, Wilson's Disease, or peripheral neuropathy), contractures or fixed joint&#xD;
        deformities, current or past use of neuroleptics, seizures, prior neurosurgery, or&#xD;
        co-existent neurologic or general medical illness, including history of cardiovascular&#xD;
        disease or peptic ulcer disease and pregnant or breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are taking or have taken mexiletine will be excluded as well.&#xD;
