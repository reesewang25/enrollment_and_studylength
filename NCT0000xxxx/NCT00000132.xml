      The primary purpose is to compare the effect of immediate therapy to lower the intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) versus late or no treatment on the progression of newly detected open-angle&#xD;
      glaucoma, as measured by increasing visual field loss and/or optic disc changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purposes are to determine the extent of IOP reduction attained by treatment, to&#xD;
      explore factors that may influence glaucoma progression, and to describe the natural history&#xD;
      of newly detected glaucoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a common disease in older adults. All present treatment aims at reduction of the&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, but indications for therapy are not well defined. Furthermore, it is&#xD;
      unclear whether intraocular pressure influences the natural history of glaucoma. Against this&#xD;
      background, the primary aim of the study is of central importance to patients with manifest&#xD;
      and suspect glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma has few subjective symptoms during a long period early in the disease, but damage is&#xD;
      irreversible once it occurs. Early diagnosis and rapid detection of progression are of&#xD;
      paramount importance in limiting this damage, whether through pressure reduction or in some&#xD;
      other way. The effectiveness, if any, of lowering the intraocular pressure in glaucoma&#xD;
      requires evaluation by controlled treatment trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) is the first large, controlled, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the effect of lowering the intraocular pressure on the progression of newly&#xD;
      detected, open-angle glaucoma. This study will compare glaucoma progression in initially&#xD;
      treated versus untreated patients with newly detected open-angle glaucoma and will allow&#xD;
      quantification of the effect of immediate IOP-lowering treatment on progression during the&#xD;
      followup period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMGT is a collaborative effort that involves a Clinical Center at the Department of&#xD;
      Ophthalmology of Malmo University Hospital at the University of Lund, Sweden, and its&#xD;
      Satellite Center in Helsingborg, Sweden; an independent Data Center at the Department of&#xD;
      Preventive Medicine, University Medical Center at Stony Brook, New York; and a Disc&#xD;
      Photography Reading Center at the Department of Ophthalmology in Lund at the University of&#xD;
      Lund. The study was initiated with support from the Swedish Medical Research Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment for the study has been completed. The 255 patients were identified by an&#xD;
      extensive, population-based screening of successive age cohorts as well as by clinical&#xD;
      referral. The diagnosis was confirmed through Humphrey perimetry at two postscreening visits&#xD;
      to the Clinical Center or Satellite Center. Eligible patients who agreed to participate had&#xD;
      two additional visits for collection of baseline data. They were randomized to treatment with&#xD;
      the beta blocker Betaxolol and argon laser trabeculoplasty (treated group) or to no initial&#xD;
      treatment (control group) with close followup of both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for a minimum of 4 years to assess the development of glaucoma&#xD;
      progression. They are seen every 3 months to collect visual field, IOP, and other data. Disc&#xD;
      photographs are taken every 6 months. Technicians and disc photograph graders are masked&#xD;
      regarding treatment assignment. Additional followup visits are held to confirm visual field&#xD;
      progression and IOP elevation (&gt;25 mm Hg in treated group, &gt;35 mm Hg in control group).&#xD;
      Patients in the treated group receive Xalantan whenever IOP exceeds 25 mm Hg at more than one&#xD;
      visit; patients in the control group will receive Xalantan whenever IOP reaches 35 mm Hg or&#xD;
      higher during the trial. If IOP remains high, individualized treatment is given. All patients&#xD;
      continue to be followed to monitor the development of end points and will be analyzed in&#xD;
      their originally assigned groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study outcome is glaucoma progression, which is based on specific criteria derived from&#xD;
      analyses of Humphrey visual fields and masked evaluations of disc photographs. The perimetric&#xD;
      outcome is defined as statistically significant deterioration (p &lt; 0.05) of the same three or&#xD;
      more test points in Pattern Deviation Change Probability Maps in three consecutive C30-2&#xD;
      Humphrey fields. Optic disc progression is determined by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of definite change (detected by comparison of followup photographs with&#xD;
           baseline) by flicker chronoscopy in two followup photographs from the same visit, with&#xD;
           independent confirmation by side-by-side gradings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final confirmation of change toward progression, by flicker chronoscopy and by&#xD;
           side-by-side gradings, at a different followup visit.&#xD;
