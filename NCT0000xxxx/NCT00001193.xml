      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of high dose melphalan and autologous bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation given as consolidation therapy to patients with inflammatory or&#xD;
      metastatic carcinoma of the breast in complete remission. All patients entered will receive&#xD;
      induction therapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil with&#xD;
      hormonal synchronization utilizing tamoxifen and premarin as in a previous Medicine Branch&#xD;
      protocol (MB-160C). Among patients with inflammatory carcinoma of the breast, pathologic&#xD;
      complete responders will receive irradiation to the breast and regional lymph nodes;&#xD;
      convertible partial responders and clinical complete responders with residual disease on&#xD;
      biopsy will undergo surgical resection of bulk disease followed by irradiation of the chest&#xD;
      wall and regional lymph nodes excluding the axilla. Both groups of responders will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either systemic consolidation therapy with high dose melphalan (180&#xD;
      mg/M2 total dose over 3 days) and autologous bone marrow transplantation followed by&#xD;
      maintenance therapy or maintenance therapy alone. Complete responders in this noninflammatory&#xD;
      group will not receive further therapy since, historically, they have done well following&#xD;
      induction and local therapy, with maintenance therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metastatic breast cancer will be assessed for response throughout induction&#xD;
      therapy. Complete and convertable partial responders will receive consolidative therapy and&#xD;
      be randomized to ABMT followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy vs. maintenance alone.&#xD;

        Patients must have a histologically documented diagnosis of mammary carcinoma and evaluable&#xD;
        disease in the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnostic tissue must be reviewed at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All ICB patients must meet Haagensen's clinical criteria of ICB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with metastatic breast cancer must have evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There must be no history of prior cytotoxic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There must be no history of previous malignancy except for cured nonmelanoma skin cancer&#xD;
        and cervical carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance status (Karnofsky scale) must be greater than 30 for patients with metastatic&#xD;
        breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Staging workup must be negative for distant metastases in Stage III patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WBC count greater than 4000 per mm(3) and platelet count greater than 100,000 per mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal hepatic and renal function, unless due to tumor involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to give informed consent and be geographically accessible for&#xD;
        follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of other malignant neoplasms except for curatively treated nonmelanoma skin&#xD;
        cancer or surgically cured carcinoma of the cervix in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not be poor medical or psychiatric risks because of non-malignant systemic&#xD;
        disease which would preclude them being subjected to any of the treatments in this&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
