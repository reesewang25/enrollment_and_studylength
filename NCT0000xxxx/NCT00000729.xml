  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the toxicity of low dose foscarnet administered for 4 weeks to HIV infected&#xD;
      patients who are asymptomatic, have AIDS, or other HIV associated conditions and a CD4+&#xD;
      lymphocyte count &lt; 500 cells/mm3. To obtain preliminary efficacy data. Although zidovudine&#xD;
      (AZT) has been effective in treating some AIDS patients, AZT has toxic effects in many&#xD;
      patients and other means of treating HIV-infected persons need to be evaluated. In vitro&#xD;
      (test tube) studies have shown that the human herpes viruses are inhibited by foscarnet and&#xD;
      that a number of retroviruses, including HIV, are sensitive to it. It is hoped that treatment&#xD;
      of HIV-infected individuals with foscarnet during an early phase of HIV infections will&#xD;
      reduce the risk of developing AIDS.&#xD;

      Although zidovudine (AZT) has been effective in treating some AIDS patients, AZT has toxic&#xD;
      effects in many patients and other means of treating HIV-infected persons need to be&#xD;
      evaluated. In vitro (test tube) studies have shown that the human herpes viruses are&#xD;
      inhibited by foscarnet and that a number of retroviruses, including HIV, are sensitive to it.&#xD;
      It is hoped that treatment of HIV-infected individuals with foscarnet during an early phase&#xD;
      of HIV infections will reduce the risk of developing AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are divided into three groups: (1) asymptomatic patients with or without persistent&#xD;
      generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) syndrome; (2) patients with AIDS; and (3) patients who have&#xD;
      or have had mild to moderate signs or symptoms consistent with HIV infection. Patients are&#xD;
      then randomly chosen to receive one of three different foscarnet doses. The drug is given for&#xD;
      4 weeks, by 1-hour infusion administered every 8 hours. In addition, those patients who are&#xD;
      clinically stable and have not experienced severe toxicity at the end of the 4 weeks may&#xD;
      continue treatment, in the form of a single daily dose of foscarnet to be administered 5 days&#xD;
      per week. Blood samples are taken during treatment and at the first, fourth, and eighth week&#xD;
      after treatment. If the patient is on maintenance, blood samples are taken weekly. Effective&#xD;
      7-17-89, patients entering the study are assigned to the lowest foscarnet dose. Patients&#xD;
      receive daily treatment for 28 days. Patients who are clinically stable without severe&#xD;
      toxicity at 4 weeks have the option of maintenance therapy with foscarnet.&#xD;
