  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the maximum long-term dosage of ribavirin (RBV) that is safe and free of serious&#xD;
      side effects in patients with AIDS or AIDS related illnesses. Also, to determine what effect&#xD;
      different dosage levels have on biologic markers of efficacy, such as the amount of the AIDS&#xD;
      virus (HIV) or number of T cells in the patient's blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RBV is a new drug capable of inhibiting the growth of the AIDS virus in the laboratory with&#xD;
      little effect on normal human cells. In earlier tests of RBV in AIDS patients, the drug was&#xD;
      well tolerated and safe, and this favorable result suggested that RBV should be more&#xD;
      extensively studied in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS related complex (ARC).&#xD;

      RBV is a new drug capable of inhibiting the growth of the AIDS virus in the laboratory with&#xD;
      little effect on normal human cells. In earlier tests of RBV in AIDS patients, the drug was&#xD;
      well tolerated and safe, and this favorable result suggested that RBV should be more&#xD;
      extensively studied in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS related complex (ARC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are selected from three patient groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with AIDS, who have not taken zidovudine (AZT) within 30 days of entry into the&#xD;
           study and who have not been discontinued from AZT because of intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with AIDS related diseases who have not taken AZT within 30 days of entry into&#xD;
           the study, and who have not been discontinued from AZT because of intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with AIDS or AIDS related diseases who have had AZT intolerance that required&#xD;
           cessation of therapy. This is an outpatient study; patients are seen weekly for the&#xD;
           first 4 weeks, every other week through week 12, and then every 4 weeks for the duration&#xD;
           of the 24 weeks of the treatment portion of the study. Patients from each of the three&#xD;
           diagnostic groups are enrolled at each dose level. For the first 3 days after entry into&#xD;
           the study, all patients receive the lowest dose of RBV every 6 hours. Subsequent dosages&#xD;
           increase until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD for a group is&#xD;
           defined as the dose at which 4 or more of the 8 patients in the group develop toxicity&#xD;
           which requires a change or discontinuation of the dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience significant toxicity may continue in the study at lower dose to&#xD;
      determine the long-term tolerance.&#xD;
