      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study built on a previous study funded by the Health Effects Institute, a non-profit&#xD;
      foundation jointly supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and vehicle&#xD;
      manufacturers. The previous study was a prospective cohort study of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)&#xD;
      exposure and respiratory symptoms and illnesses during the first 18 months of life. Between&#xD;
      January, 1988 and June, 1990, 1,315 infants were enrolled and then followed with collection&#xD;
      of daily respiratory symptom data and serial monitoring of NO2 concentrations in their homes.&#xD;
      The full protocol was completed by 823 subjects and a total follow-up experience of over&#xD;
      one-half million days was accumulated. Follow-up ended in December, 1991 and analyses related&#xD;
      to the study's principal focus, the health effects of NO2, was completed during the fall of&#xD;
      1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses were directed at the following: 1) Time spent in day-care and the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of respiratory illnesses; 2) Breast-feeding and the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      respiratory illnesses during the first six months of life; 3) Determinants of wheezing and&#xD;
      wheezing illnesses; 4) Determinants of a physician-diagnosis of asthma; 5) Exposure to&#xD;
      woodsmoke and incidence and severity of respiratory illnesses; 6) Household demographics,&#xD;
      including ethnicity, and incidence and severity of respiratory illnesses; 7) Determinants of&#xD;
      the duration of respiratory illnesses; 8) The validity of retrospective parental reports of&#xD;
      respiratory illness; 9) Parental perceptions of the risks of indoor and outdoor air&#xD;
      pollution; 10) Clinical findings on assessment of ill children in the community.&#xD;
