  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas, the most frequent malignant brain tumor in adults, are widespread in the&#xD;
      brain, despite their discrete appearance on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). While this tumor tends to spread widely in the brain, unlike other tumors of&#xD;
      the body, it rarely metastasizes, or spreads, to other organs. Approximately 10 percent of&#xD;
      patients with glioblastoma develop metastatic disease after radiation or brain surgery. In&#xD;
      the absence of radiation or brain surgery, few patients have developed disease spread outside&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery to remove tumors of other organs of the body, such as the lung, prostate,&#xD;
      kidney, or ovary, cells from these tumors are routinely found in the bloodstream. These cells&#xD;
      are believed to be the reason for the spread of these tumors. In the case of malignant brain&#xD;
      tumors, this process of glioma (tumor) cells shedding into circulation has not yet been&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine whether glioma cells can be detected in the bloodstream of patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery. If glioma cells are absent, it may mean they are unable to penetrate the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier. If they are present, they presumably can penetrate into blood vessels&#xD;
      but they may be recognized and eliminated by the immune system, or they may escape detection&#xD;
      yet not be able to take hold in the new microenvironment. The results of the study will add&#xD;
      to the knowledge of the biology of these highly malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be admitted to the hospital for 8 to 10 days. They will undergo a&#xD;
      complete physical and neurological exam and blood and urine tests. An electrocardiogram will&#xD;
      be performed, and x-rays may be taken. On the morning of surgery, the patient will receive&#xD;
      sedation intravenously. A tiny plastic tube called a catheter will be introduced into a vein&#xD;
      in the groin through needles. The catheter will be passed through to the jugular bulb, right&#xD;
      above the jugular vein, on the same side as the tumor. The patient will then be taken to the&#xD;
      operating room for surgery. During surgery, not more than one quarter of a unit of blood will&#xD;
      be removed through the catheter. The catheter will be removed before the patient enters the&#xD;
      intensive care unit. Another MRI will be taken after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll participants for 2 years. Patients will be followed at 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months after the surgery to make sure the postoperative period is uneventful.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas are the most frequent malignant brain tumor in adults and are widespread in the&#xD;
      brain despite their discrete appearance on CT or MRI. While locally aggressive, metastasis of&#xD;
      glioblastoma to extracranial organs is considered rare. Approximately 10% of patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma develop metastatic disease after radiation or craniotomy. Few patients have&#xD;
      developed extracranial metastatic disease in the absence of surgical resection or radiation.&#xD;
      Unlike tumors of other organs such as lung, colon and prostate, the presence of glioma cells&#xD;
      in the circulation of patients undergoing surgical resection has not been established. If&#xD;
      found absent, glioma cells may be unable to intravasate through the blood brain barrier. If&#xD;
      present, these tumor cells presumably can intravasate but may be recognized and eliminated by&#xD;
      an immunological process, or they may escape detection yet not be able to take hold in the&#xD;
      new microenvironment. The information provided will add to the knowledge of the biology of&#xD;
      these highly malignant tumors.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be diagnosed with biopsy-proven glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic&#xD;
        astrocytoma (WHO grade III and IV, WHO classification of glial tumors) and meet the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consenting males and females between the ages of 18 and 75, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Provided written informed consent prior to participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karnofsky Performance Scale Score greater than or equal to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of all races and sexes are eligible for this study. Children and adolescents only&#xD;
        rarely are afflicted with gliomas that are amenable for surgical resection, and so are&#xD;
        excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have been accepted for glioma resection under existing NINDS protocols are&#xD;
        also eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If tumor tissue is available from biopsy prior to surgery, we will attempt to identify&#xD;
        tumor-specific mutation(s) prior to enrolling the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinically unstable condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Liver function impairment (total bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dl; AST or ALT greater than&#xD;
        3 times the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Coagulopathy (prothrombin time [PT] or activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT] &gt; 1.5&#xD;
        times control).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Granulocytopenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 1,000/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acute infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acute medical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive HIV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karnofsky Performance Scale Score less than 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allergy to CT contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absence of tumor-specific gene mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women. Women of child-bearing potential will undergo a urine and/or serum&#xD;
        pregnancy test. Women who are pregnant will not be allowed to participate in this study.&#xD;
