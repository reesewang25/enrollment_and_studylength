  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a 6-month course of isoniazid ( INH ) in the&#xD;
      prevention of clinical tuberculosis in anergic (having diminished or absent reactions to&#xD;
      specific antigens) HIV-infected persons who are at high risk for tuberculous infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial number of HIV-infected persons are anergic, and thus do not respond to the only&#xD;
      currently available diagnostic tool for tuberculosis infection (that is, the PPD (purified&#xD;
      protein derivative) skin test). Many of these anergic persons are, however, infected with&#xD;
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis and eventually develop reactivation tuberculosis, causing both&#xD;
      individual illness and spread of infection to others in the community. This study examines&#xD;
      the possibility of using INH prophylaxis (that is, for prevention) in anergic HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients at high risk for tuberculosis as a means of decreasing the sharp rise in the&#xD;
      incidence of tuberculosis due to HIV infection. INH is inexpensive and relatively safe, and&#xD;
      thus may demonstrate an acceptable risk/benefit ratio as a medication that can be given over&#xD;
      a limited period of time to a population suspected of having, but not proved to have, M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis infection. If this study shows INH to be safe and effective in this setting, it&#xD;
      could have a major effect on public health in this country.&#xD;

      could have a major effect on public health in this country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are placed by a random selection process in either the INH or placebo group. One&#xD;
      group receives INH plus pyridoxine hydrochloride ( vitamin B6 ) daily for six months.&#xD;
      Patients in the other group receive placebo plus vitamin B6 daily for six months.&#xD;
