  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome suffer from ulcers of the upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, higher than normal levels of gastric acid, and tumors of the pancreas known as&#xD;
      non-beta islet cell tumors. Patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome require continuous&#xD;
      control of their gastric acid secretion. If gastric acid levels are permitted to rise higher&#xD;
      than normal, patients may develop severe ulcers and other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to determine the effectiveness of Omeprazole (Prilosec) in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. Omeprazole is a drug that functions to&#xD;
      decrease the amount of gastric acid secreted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for this study will be selected based on a previous diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison&#xD;
      Syndrome and/or idiopathic (unknown cause) high levels of gastric acid secretion. The&#xD;
      patients will undergo an evaluation including history and physical examination as well as&#xD;
      necessary laboratory tests. The proper dose of Omeprazole will then be determined in each&#xD;
      patient . The proper dose of Omeprazole is considered the minimum amount of omeprazole&#xD;
      required to lower gastric acid to a safe level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every year patients participating in this study will undergo a physical examination and&#xD;
      history. They will be questioned about symptoms associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.&#xD;
      Gastric acid levels will be taken and evaluated and patients will undergo an upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the treatment will be measured by a clinical history to determine the&#xD;
      control of symptoms due to high levels of gastric acid secretion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome require continuous control of their gastric acid&#xD;
      secretion or else severe complications of peptic ulcer disease will occur. This study&#xD;
      investigates the long-term efficacy of the oral gastric acid antisecretory drug, Omeprazole,&#xD;
      which functions as a H+ - K+ ATPase inhibitor. Long-term safety will also be investigated.&#xD;
      Also investigated is the ability of the parenteral H+-K+ ATPase inhibitor, pantoprazole to&#xD;
      control acid secretion short-term, when oral Omeprazole cannot be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the proper maintenance dose of oral Omeprazole will be determined in each&#xD;
      patient by determining the minimal dose of drug that reduces acid secretion to safe levels.&#xD;
      Patients will be examined at least annually for evidence of continued efficacy and safety.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by clinical history to assess control of symptoms due to gastric&#xD;
      acid hypersecretion, measurements of gastric acid secretion while on Omeprazole to determine&#xD;
      continued effectiveness of the drug and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to assess changes in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal mucosa. Safety will be determined by assessing clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters such as changes in hematologic or clinical chemistry parameters. Possible drug&#xD;
      induced changes in the gastric mucosa will be assessed by gastric biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With intravenous pantoprazole the ability of the recommended dose of 80 mg three times a day&#xD;
      to control acid secretion will be investigated and if this fails, 80 mg four times a day will&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
