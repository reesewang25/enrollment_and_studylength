      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver&#xD;
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with advanced kidney cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study. Initially patients receive a scout dose of iodine-131&#xD;
      radiolabeled chimeric monoclonal antibody G250 (131I-cG250) administered intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 10 minutes to determine whole body clearance. One week later, patients receive&#xD;
      incremental doses of 131I-cG250 IV over 10 minutes at 2-3 day intervals for 2-6 weeks,. Dose&#xD;
      escalation begins at least 8 weeks after the last infusion of 131I-cG250. In the absence of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity in the first 3 patients treated, subsequent cohorts of 3 patients each&#xD;
      receive escalating doses of 131I-cG250 on the same schedule. If dose-limiting toxicity occurs&#xD;
      in 2 of 6 patients treated at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and the next&#xD;
      lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Treatment continues once recovery&#xD;
      from all toxic effects occurs, beginning 8 to 12 weeks following the last dose of 131I-cG250.&#xD;
      Patients achieving complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease were eligible to&#xD;
      receive up to 3 courses of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>All adverse events occurring during the study were to be recorded on the patient's case report form, and include the following information: a description; date of onset and resolution; severity; relationship to an investigational agent; action taken and outcome. Toxicity was graded in accordance with the NCI CTCAE version 3.0.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were monitored for Adverse Events (AEs) for at least 8 weeks after the last infusion of 131I-cG250, or until recovery from all toxicity, and prior to dose escalation. Toxicity was graded in accordance with the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Version 3.0. Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 or greater toxicity related to study therapy. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as the highest safely tolerated dose where at most one of six patients experiences a DLT with the next higher dose having at least two patients who experience a DLT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Best Overall Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor responses were evaluated using computed tomography and categorized according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria at baseline and at no more than 6 weeks after the last dose, or not more than 12 weeks after entry into the study. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all measurable disease lasting at least 1 month; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 50% decrease in the size of the product of 2 perpendicular diameters of any measurable lesions and no new lesions, lasting at least one month; Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 25% increase in the size of any measurable lesions or the appearance of any new lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Human Anti-chimeric Antibodies (HACA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were taken at baseline and in weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as well as month 6. HACA was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the &quot;double antibody sandwich&quot; technique and pretreatment serum as negative control.</description>

          <description>On day 1, patients received a single dose of 131I-cG250 (5 mCi/5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes.&#xD;
Therapeutic doses of 131I-cG250 were administered the following week as fractionated outpatient doses, starting with 30 mCi/5 mg 131I-cG250. Subsequent doses of 131I-cG250 were administered at 2-3 day intervals with the total amount of 131I-cG250 administered based on the calculated clearance of the initial dose administered on day 1. Whole body activity was maintained at no more than 30 mCi iodine-131.&#xD;
In the absence of disease progression and after recovery from toxicity, patients could be re-treated beginning 8 weeks after the last treatment of the initial series, for a total of not more than 3 treatments.&#xD;
Iodine-131 radiolabeled chimeric monoclonal antibody G250 (131I-cG250): cG250 is an IgG1 chimeric monoclonal antibody. It was supplied as a sterile solution at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL in either a 2 mL or a 5 mL vial. cG250 was radiolabeled with Iodine-131 prior to use.</description>

Whole body activity was maintained at no more than 30 mCi iodine-131.&#xD;
In the absence of disease progression and after recovery from toxicity, patients could be re-treated beginning 8 weeks after the last treatment of the initial series, for a total of not more than 3 treatments.&#xD;

Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all measurable disease lasting at least 1 month; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 50% decrease in the size of the product of 2 perpendicular diameters of any measurable lesions and no new lesions, lasting at least one month; Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 25% increase in the size of any measurable lesions or the appearance of any new lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>
