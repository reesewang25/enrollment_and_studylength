      This trial will evaluate, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, the tolerability,&#xD;
      toxicities, efficacy, and immunologic effects of repeated vaccinations with a recombinant&#xD;
      vaccinia virus that contains the Prostate Specific Antigen gene (PROSTVAC). Patients with&#xD;
      PSA-expressing adenocarcinoma of the prostate will be evaluated for eligibility that includes&#xD;
      a history of prior vaccinia (as vaccine against smallpox) and immunocompetence. We completed&#xD;
      a phase I trial investigating the use of rV-CEA in adenocarcinomas of the GI tract, lung and&#xD;
      breast. The toxicities encountered are local reactions to the vaccine. We did not encounter&#xD;
      any myelosuppression or systemic autoimmune reaction. We would like to evaluate four doses to&#xD;
      ensure safety and to decide a best biological dose. Six patients will receive 2.65 x 10(5)&#xD;
      PFU and 2.65 x 10(6) PFU of vaccine by scarification. Because higher doses cannot be achieved&#xD;
      by scarification, six patients will receive 2.65 x 10(7) PFU and 2.65 x 10(8) PFU&#xD;
      subcutaneously. We plan to give three vaccinations at four week intervals. All six patients&#xD;
      treated in each dose level must be evaluable for 4 weeks before enrolling patients at the&#xD;
      higher dose level. No intrapatient escalation is planned. Toxicity, tumor response, and&#xD;
      humoral and cellular immunity factors will be monitored. Optional lymphapheresis will be done&#xD;
      on patients that are HLA A2. Once we determined the best biological dose, we would like to&#xD;
      accrue an additional 6 patients to that level.&#xD;
