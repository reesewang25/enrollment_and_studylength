      To determine whether modification of risk factors altered the rate of progression of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease in arteries with mild atherosclerosis and no mechanical intervention in&#xD;
      patients who had coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty&#xD;
      (PTCA).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of difficulties with quantitative measurement and with feasibility of follow-up, few&#xD;
      controlled studies prior to SCRIP had been completed to determine the impact of risk factor&#xD;
      modification directly on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in humans. Suggestive&#xD;
      evidence existed from animal studies, especially in primates, that diet and exercise altered&#xD;
      atherosclerosis as a result of risk modification. But these animal models did not accurately&#xD;
      represent the potential for modifying the coronary atherosclerotic process in humans. Some&#xD;
      indirect evidence had been developed in humans by studying arteries more accessible than the&#xD;
      coronaries. In the several preliminary studies reported using coronary arteriography to study&#xD;
      the impact of risk modification on atherosclerosis, the results had been encouraging but far&#xD;
      from definitive. One angiographic follow-up study of vein bypass grafts and severely&#xD;
      atherosclerotic coronary arteries reported improvement with lipid lowering therapy. None of&#xD;
      these studies had included randomization of patients to systematic, intense, long-term risk&#xD;
      reduction versus usual care with prospectively identified coronary artery segments with mild&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, fixed-sample. A total of 300 patients were randomized, 155 to usual care (UC) in&#xD;
      the community and 145 to special intervention (SI). The SI group received intensive efforts&#xD;
      directed at reducing or eliminating risk factors, including lowering LDL-cholesterol and&#xD;
      increasing HDL-cholesterol, reducing blood pressure, eliminating cigarette smoking and&#xD;
      obesity, increasing exercise, and decreasing stressful life experience. The major endpoint&#xD;
      was the rate of coronary artery disease progression as measured by angiography, at baseline&#xD;
      and at forty-eight months. Follow-up was for four years.&#xD;
