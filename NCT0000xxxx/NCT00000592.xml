      To reduce episodes of first time stroke by 75 percent in children with sickle cell anemia by&#xD;
      the administration of prophylactic transfusion therapy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke, occurring in about 10 percent of pediatric patients with sickle cell disease, is one&#xD;
      of the most devastating complications, with a high recurrence rate after the first episode.&#xD;
      Several non-randomized studies have shown reduction in stroke recurrence when periodic blood&#xD;
      transfusions are administered to maintain hemoglobin S under 30 percent. Periodic blood&#xD;
      transfusions are associated with significant risks of iron overload and other complications&#xD;
      and must be accompanied by parenteral iron chelation therapy. However, this has become a&#xD;
      standard of care for prevention of recurrent stroke in SS children. Thus, a randomized trial&#xD;
      of blood transfusion for secondary prevention would not be feasible because it would be&#xD;
      considered unethical. Based on various studies, the recurrence rate is reduced from 46 to 67&#xD;
      percent to approximately 7 percent on transfusion therapy. Because most stroke patients are&#xD;
      left with some neurological deficit, and face a lifetime of disability, primary prevention&#xD;
      would have a significant impact on the management of patients. However, because of&#xD;
      complications of blood transfusions, the hypothesis should be proven by a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A primary prevention trial had not been possible because an acceptable means of detecting&#xD;
      those children at risk of stroke was not available. The advent of TCD to identify arterial&#xD;
      abnormalities for the prediction of stroke has provided a means of detection. TCD&#xD;
      abnormalities have a high specificity (100 percent) and high sensitivity (90 percent) for&#xD;
      detecting angiographically proven narrowing of arterial diameter. Thus, TCD examination of&#xD;
      the basal cerebral arteries is predictive of who will develop a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, Phase III, multicenter. Approximately 3,000 children from 12 clinics were&#xD;
      screened with transcranial Doppler (TCD). A total of 130 were randomized to receive either&#xD;
      standard supportive care or periodic blood transfusions if they were found to be at high risk&#xD;
      of stroke on the basis of elevated cerebral blood flow as measured by TCD screening tests.&#xD;
      Primary endpoints included clinically evident symptoms of cerebral infarction with consistent&#xD;
      findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints included asymptomatic brain lesions detected by MRI in brain areas not&#xD;
      involved in primary endpoints. Hematologic characteristics of the high risk group were&#xD;
      analyzed and serum and DNA samples frozen for future analysis. Recruitment ended in October&#xD;
      1997 with the accrual of 130 subjects. The clinical phase ended in 1999.&#xD;
