  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine if the administration of multi-drug adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      for patients with primary non-metastatic osteogenic sarcoma, both prior to and after the&#xD;
      definitive surgical procedure for their primary tumor is superior as a treatment strategy to&#xD;
      the current approach of giving drugs only after the definitive surgical procedure has been&#xD;
      performed. An effort will be made as well to determine if the administration of&#xD;
      pre-definitive surgery, chemotherapy leads to an increase in the proportion of the patients&#xD;
      suitable for a limb salvage primary surgical procedure.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Must be less than or equal to 30 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior history of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior therapy-other than biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed consent according or institutional guidelines (Agreement to randomization to&#xD;
        either presurgical chemotherapy or immediate surgery-physicians must also agree).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Less than or equal to 21 days since initial diagnosis and eligible to have surgery within 3&#xD;
        weeks of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have a high grade osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have low grade osteosarcoma, periosteal and parosteal&#xD;
&#xD;
        osteosarcoma, or multi-focal sclerosing of osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tumor must be confined to extremity or expendable and resectable bone of axial skeleton&#xD;
        (i.e., ilium, scapula, clavicle, rib).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No evidence of metastases by PE, CXR, chest CT, and bone scans. (Chest CT must be normal&#xD;
        within 2 weeks of randomization). Abnormalities on chest CT must be biopsy-negative or&#xD;
        thoracotomy negative. Suspicious lesions on bone scan should be biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        LDH level and surgical intent (i.e., amputation, resection, or limb replacement) must be&#xD;
        known before patient is registered.&#xD;
