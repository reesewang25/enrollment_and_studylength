  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a novel fiber optic device for treating&#xD;
      scalp psoriasis with ultraviolet (UV-B) light. A effective treatment is not currently&#xD;
      available for people with scalp psoriasis. Present methods for treating psoriasis with UV-B&#xD;
      light cannot be used for the scalp because hair is usually blocking the light from reaching&#xD;
      the affected skin. Our method overcomes this problem with the use of a comb that has optical&#xD;
      fibers to deliver light directly to the skin. We will evaluate this device in a clinical&#xD;
      setting and will use the results to tailor the design of the comb before producing it in&#xD;
      large quantities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Scalp psoriasis can be treated with a novel fiber optic delivery system that irradiates the&#xD;
      psoriatic scalp of patients with UV-B light via an optical fiber comb. Current methods for&#xD;
      treatment of psoriasis with light are not applicable to the scalp because hair is usually&#xD;
      blocking the light from reaching the affected skin. Our method overcomes this problem with&#xD;
      the use of a comb that has optical fibers to deliver light directly to the skin. We have&#xD;
      developed a UV-B light source and a fiber optic comb for use in clinics and doctors' offices.&#xD;
      We will evaluate this device in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this trial will provide data about the effectiveness of the device. We will&#xD;
      use these results to tailor the design before it is ready for volume production. If&#xD;
      successful, the UV-B light source and fiber optic comb will provide treatment to people&#xD;
      affected with scalp psoriasis. At present, these people do not have any effective treatment&#xD;
      available to them.&#xD;
