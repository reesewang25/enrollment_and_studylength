  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) perform poorly on tasks dependent on access to, and&#xD;
      utilization of, previously acquired knowledge and skills. It has been commonly assumed that&#xD;
      impaired knowledge in AD, as well as in other patients with cortical lesions, is due to an&#xD;
      actual loss or disorganization of a specific knowledge base or system. This hypothesis has,&#xD;
      however, recently been called into question by data from tasks that purport to tap knowledge&#xD;
      on a more automatic and implicit level. For example, although AD patients are impaired on&#xD;
      object naming and verbal fluency tasks, they show a normal pattern of semantic facilitation&#xD;
      on reaction time based priming tasks. In fact, the level of facilitation or activation on&#xD;
      these tasks has often been reported to be greater in AD patients than in normal individuals.&#xD;
      These and similar data have been used to support arguments that performance decrements in AD&#xD;
      patients are due to deficits in attentional and/or retrieval processes rather than a&#xD;
      degradation of knowledge stores. The central focus of this project will be to test a model of&#xD;
      the semantic representations of object that predicts increased facilitation or hyperpriming&#xD;
      in AD patients as a result of degraded representations. The relationship between performance&#xD;
      on on-line priming tasks, visual attention and spatial processes, and explicit and implicit&#xD;
      measures of memory also will be examined. In addition to normal controls, patients with&#xD;
      cognitive and memory impairments, but without semantically-based naming difficulties (elderly&#xD;
      depressed, Huntington's disease, Korsakoff's disease) will serve as controls for overall&#xD;
      slowness of response and degree of explicit memory deficit.&#xD;

        Subjects will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients assigned a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease meeting NINCDS-ADRDA and&#xD;
        DSM-III-R criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with other neuropsychiatric illness (i.e., depression, Korsakoff's disease,&#xD;
        Huntington's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have major concomitant illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will be drug-free for at least 2 weeks whenever possible. Concurrent use of&#xD;
        some medications (i.e., diuretics or antibiotics) will be allowed only after careful review&#xD;
        by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal control subjects will be without a history of or present psychiatric or neurological&#xD;
        illness.&#xD;
