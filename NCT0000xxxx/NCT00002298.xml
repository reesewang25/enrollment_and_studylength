  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether long-term oral dosage of&#xD;
      ribavirin delays development of symptomatic HIV disease in HIV antibody positive subjects who&#xD;
      are completely asymptomatic (CDC classification group II), who have only the lymphadenopathy&#xD;
      syndrome (CDC classification group III), or who have clinical symptoms but not severe HIV&#xD;
      disease as defined by CDC classification, and whether the dosage regimen is safe and&#xD;
      tolerable in these subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded within 4 weeks of start of screening tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zidovudine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other drug with scientifically accepted anti-HIV properties.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myelosuppressant or other known toxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV infection group II (CDC), asymptomatic HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV antibody positive by Western blot with antibodies to p24 band and GP160 band&#xD;
             and/or GP41. Two positive tests during screening will be required. CDC HIV infection&#xD;

             between evaluations. These three counts will be averaged and for inclusion in the&#xD;
             study the mean of the OKT4+ lymphocyte count must be greater than 200 cells/mm3 and&#xD;
             less than 600 cells/mm3. Conclusion of screening tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 42 days of starting them. Patients must be entered into the study within 14&#xD;
             days of screening completion. Ability to participate as outpatient:&#xD;

             treatment plan and evaluation schedule. Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be signed before randomization to treatment. Physical activity evaluation with&#xD;
             Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 90.&#xD;
