  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test an osteoporosis prevention program aimed at preadolescent girls between&#xD;
      the ages of 10 and 12 who have not yet started their menstrual periods. Girls in this age&#xD;
      group are adding large amounts of new bone to their skeletons. Adding more bone at this time&#xD;
      of life can reduce a person's chances of developing osteoporosis (thinning bones) in later&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will look at how this osteoporosis prevention program affects the amount of calcium in the&#xD;
      girls' diets, the amount of weight-bearing exercise they do, and their bone mass measured&#xD;
      using ultrasound testing of the heel.&#xD;

      The study's objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of a behavioral/educational intervention&#xD;
      in increasing levels of dietary calcium intake and weight-bearing exercise within an at-risk&#xD;
      population in a stage of rapid accrual of bone mass-specifically, premenarchal girls between&#xD;
      the ages of 10 and 12. We will use cluster randomization to randomize girls to either the&#xD;
      intervention or a program of education only. We will randomize eighteen groups of girls into&#xD;
      each arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of six interactive sessions using various media (i.e., overhead&#xD;
      transparencies, graphics, and three-dimensional demonstrations) to present instructional&#xD;
      material. Topics include an explanation of osteoporosis and its modifiable and nonmodifiable&#xD;
      risk factors, prevention of osteoporosis via healthy food choices (i.e., high calcium, low&#xD;
      fat foods), and prevention of osteoporosis via weight-bearing exercise. Each girl monitors&#xD;
      her own progress toward the goal of 1350 to 1500 milligrams of calcium per day. A similar&#xD;
      method allows simple self-monitoring of weight-bearing activity. The intervention program is&#xD;
      reinforced via monthly self-monitoring for 18 months. The education-only program consists of&#xD;
      six generic sessions on healthy eating, physical fitness, and healthy lifestyle choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of interest are higher calcium intake and higher levels of&#xD;
      weight-bearing exercise. A secondary outcome of interest is increased broadband ultrasound&#xD;
      attenuation of the os calcis, assessed using quantitative ultrasound. In summary, the group&#xD;
      of girls targeted is ideal for this intervention because they are at a stage of rapid accrual&#xD;
      of bone mass.&#xD;
