  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virus present in semen likely contributes substantially to the sexual transmission of HIV.&#xD;
      However, the source of HIV in semen is unknown. Some evidence suggests that the prostate may&#xD;
      be the source of at least some of the virus in semen. This study is designed to determine&#xD;
      whether the prostate may serve as the source of virus in semen by comparing the concentration&#xD;
      of HIV-1 RNA in semen donated normally, in semen obtained following prostatic massage, and in&#xD;
      expressed prostatic secretions. Finding a source for semen HIV would provide important&#xD;
      insights into several aspects of HIV sexual transmission. Since some drugs do not enter the&#xD;
      prostate well, the finding that virus is produced in the prostate might suggest the prostate&#xD;
      could serve as a reservoir for HIV, leading to the development of resistance to antiviral&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        HIV positive male.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willing and able to participate on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stable antiretroviral therapy for the preceding 4 weeks and judged likely to remain on&#xD;
        stable therapy for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of vasectomy or orchiectomy may be admitted to the study, but the&#xD;
        data obtained from those patients will be analyzed separately on a pilot basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No clinical or laboratory evidence of bacterial prostatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No clinical or laboratory evidence of genito-urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count greater than 500/ul.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelets greater than 50,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must not have had treatment within the prior 8 weeks with anti-androgens or&#xD;
        estrogens. Stable therapy with anabolic steroids will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must not have localized or systemic disease which would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator(s), render the patient at risk following prostatic massage and/or the donation&#xD;
        of semen.&#xD;
