      OBJECTIVES: I. Phase II trial to determine surgical morbidity of decompression coring,&#xD;
      including any adverse events in the perioperative period and the rate of secondary medical or&#xD;
      surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Collect preliminary data to determine if decompression coring results in a substantial&#xD;
      improvement in pain and mobility compared to conservative therapy in patients with avascular&#xD;
      necrosis of the hip related to sickle cell disease.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according&#xD;
      to stage of avascular necrosis (I vs II vs III). Patients are randomized into one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients undergo a core biopsy and decompression of the hip followed by a standardized&#xD;
      program of touch down or nonweight bearing with appropriate equipment and regular physical&#xD;
      therapy for 6 weeks and then full weight bearing if tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients undergo the standardized ambulation and physical therapy program as in arm&#xD;
      I. They do not undergo any surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 1 week prior to the beginning of the standardized program and during the 6 weeks of touch&#xD;
      down or nonweight bearing, all patients complete a weekly pain and medication diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 3 months and 6 months, then every 6 months for 1.5 years, and then&#xD;
      annually for up to 5 years.&#xD;
