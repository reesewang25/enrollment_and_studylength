      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the use of antihypertensive medication increasing steadily over the last 25 years,&#xD;
      treatment for hypertension is now common. Given the high prevalence of treatment for&#xD;
      hypertension, researchers can no longer assume that participants in epidemiologic studies&#xD;
      represent natural blood pressure measures, as opposed to treated blood pressure measures. The&#xD;
      effect of this high prevalence of treatment, however, has not been fully investigated.&#xD;
      Although it might seem that studies of &quot;natural history&quot; are no longer relevant, great&#xD;
      interest currently exists in establishing both environmental and genetic determinants of&#xD;
      blood pressure. Additionally, there currently is a renewed interest in refining treatment&#xD;
      guidelines. For example, the need to account for absolute as well as relative risk has been&#xD;
      hotly debated in recent years. The need will continue to exist, therefore, to analyze&#xD;
      observational data sets to meet the evolving interest in the determinants of blood pressure&#xD;
      and to meet the requirements for more refined risk estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of blood pressure treatment on the analysis of epidemiologic&#xD;
      studies, the investigators conducted two interrelated analyses using simulation studies and&#xD;
      data from five observational studies: The Framingham Heart Study; the NHANES I, II, and III&#xD;
      cohorts; and The International Collaborative Study of Hypertension in Blacks (ICSHIB). They&#xD;
      first conducted simulation studies to examine the behavior of different methodologies in each&#xD;
      of two common analytic settings: relating body mass index to level of systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      and relating level of systolic blood pressure to coronary heart disease mortality. They&#xD;
      planned to use the data from the five studies to derive the parameters for use in the&#xD;
      simulation studies. In these studies they quantified the level of bias that results from&#xD;
      ignoring the presence of blood pressure treatment in observational data. After conducting&#xD;
      their simulations studies, they repeated the analysis of the relationship between body mass&#xD;
      index and systolic blood pressure using available empirical data.&#xD;
