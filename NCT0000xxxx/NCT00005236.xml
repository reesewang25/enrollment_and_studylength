  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether there were differences in the prevalence and extent of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      lesions in the coronaries and aortas between Alaskan natives and non-natives, and whether the&#xD;
      extent of the lesions was related to omega-3 fatty acids in blood and tissues.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purported low mortality from coronary heart disease in Eskimos from Greenland, Canada, or&#xD;
      Alaska has been interpreted by many investigators as synonymous with the absence of or&#xD;
      reduced amount of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries compared to populations&#xD;
      with a high rate of coronary heart disease. It was thought that this study would help to&#xD;
      clarify the role of omega-3 fatty acids in atherosclerosis but also would help in making a&#xD;
      decision whether to recommend to the general public the inclusion of fish oils, which contain&#xD;
      large amounts of these fatty acids in the diet, for prevention and/or reduction of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary arteries, aortas, blood, adipose tissue, and liver were collected at autopsy from&#xD;
      deceased Alaskan natives, aged 5 years and above, dying of all causes and from a similar&#xD;
      number of age- and sex-matched non-native Alaskans. Tested standardized methods of gross&#xD;
      evaluation, histomorphometry, and chemistry were used to characterize, measure, and evaluate&#xD;
      the prevalence and extent of atherosclerosis in arteries. Chemical methods for determination&#xD;
      of blood and tissue lipids and gas liquid chromatographic methods for determination of fatty&#xD;
      acids in various lipid fractions in plasma and tissues were used. Risk factors for coronary&#xD;
      artery disease were evaluated from tissues taken at autopsy. Hypertension was evaluated by an&#xD;
      examination of kidney arterioles. Cigarette smoking was evaluated by measurement of&#xD;
      thiocyanate in the blood and the presence or absence of diabetes was evaluated by measuring&#xD;
      glycosylation of hemoglobin from red blood cells. Findings were compared with those studied&#xD;
      in other populations such as Blacks and whites in New Orleans, and Japanese, Norwegians and&#xD;
      nineteen other ethnic groups in the International Atherosclerosis Project.&#xD;
