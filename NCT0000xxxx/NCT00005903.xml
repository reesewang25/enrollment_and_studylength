    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of an experimental drug called GDNF&#xD;
      delivered through an investigational device to treat progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).&#xD;
      The drug will be administered directly into the brain through catheters attached to an&#xD;
      infusion pump implanted in the abdomen. The study will evaluate 1) if the drug is safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated when given by this method; 2) the performance of the catheters and pump&#xD;
      system, and 3) the effects of GDNF on PSP symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSP is a rare neurological disease that causes eye movement dysfunction, muscle rigidity,&#xD;
      slowness of movement, swallowing, speech, emotional, cognitive and personality problems.&#xD;
      Patients 35 to 75 years old with PSP may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened at the National Institutes of Health outpatient clinic in Bethesda, MD, with a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, neurological and neuropsychiatric evaluations, blood&#xD;
      tests, electrocardiogram, CT scan of the brain, and baseline studies including a special eye&#xD;
      examination, evaluation of symptoms, lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and psychiatric interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will undergo surgery to place two catheters into the brain and&#xD;
      two infusion pumps under the skin in the upper abdomen. The surgery will be performed at&#xD;
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN. It will be done under general&#xD;
      anesthesia and will require a 3 day hospitalization. Within 24 hours after the surgery, a CT&#xD;
      scan of the brain will be done to ensure the catheters are properly placed. Patients return&#xD;
      to NIH two weeks after surgery for post-surgery examination and treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive continuous infusions of GNDF through one catheter and placebo (an&#xD;
      inactive salt solution) through the other for 6 months. Half of the patients will receive&#xD;
      placebo in the right side of the brain and GNDF in the left, and half will receive GNDF in&#xD;
      the right side of the brain and placebo in the left. All patients will also undergo the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief physical examination, and evaluation of symptoms and adverse side effects - every 2&#xD;
      weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests - every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then every 8 weeks until the&#xD;
      end of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan to check catheter placement - weeks 9 and 27&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thorough evaluation of symptoms - before beginning treatment and weeks 1, 5, 9, 17 and 27&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric evaluation - week 27&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special eye examination - weeks 1 and 27&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture - week 27&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional blood tests to measure drug concentration and antibodies - 6 times during the&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some patients may be asked to have positron emission tomography (PET) scans or a&#xD;
      single photon emission tomography (SPECT) scan, or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefit of GDNF is unknown. In studies with rats and monkeys, GNDF increased&#xD;
      the number and size of brain cells containing the chemical messenger dopamine and some&#xD;
      movement and balance problems were lessened. Earlier studies of GDNF infused into the&#xD;
      ventricles of patients with Parkinson's disease showed no benefit and no serious harm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and initial efficacy of the unilateral intralenticular infusion of&#xD;
      recombinant-methionyl human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (r-metHuGDNF) will be&#xD;
      compared with the contralateral intralenticular infusion of a placebo solution, both&#xD;
      continuously administered using chronically implanted catheters and pumps in up to 10&#xD;
      patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. Safety will be evaluated by analyzing implant-,&#xD;
      post-implant-, and treatment-emergent adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, and&#xD;
      disease status. Efficacy will be studied by comparing left and right sided neurologic&#xD;
      function using validated clinical scales as well as by putative surrogate biochemical and&#xD;
      radiographic measures.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of PSP with bilateral symptoms based on medical history and neurologic&#xD;
             examination in accordance with NINDS criteria. Those evidencing ratable limb&#xD;
             dysfunction bilaterally as well as a past history levodopa responsivity will be&#xD;
             especially sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. PSP will be considered clinically to be at a moderate to moderately advanced stage&#xD;
             (PSP Staging System grade BB - DD), associated with ratable parkinsonian signs in the&#xD;
             limbs bilaterally and a Hoehn and Yahr grade of 3 - 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Men or nonpregnant women age 35 to 75 years. Women of childbearing potential must have&#xD;
             a negative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test result immediately before (within&#xD;
             48 hours) catheter and pump implantation and repeated again immediately before (within&#xD;
             48 hours) the start of drug infusion; men and women of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             practice adequate contraception during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Before any study-specific procedures are performed, the subject and their designated&#xD;
             representative must give signed informed consent for their participation. All patients&#xD;
             must sign a Durable Power of Attorney (DPA). Device implantation must occur within 60&#xD;
             days after a subject consents to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject is medically able to undergo the surgical procedures required to implant&#xD;
             bilateral pumps and intracranial catheters using stereotactic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Treatment with levodopa, dopamine agonists or any other antiparkinsonian medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of clinically significant psychosis or hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any disorder that precludes a surgical procedure (e.g., bleeding diathesis, signs of&#xD;
             sepsis or inadequately treated infection) alters wound healing or renders bilateral&#xD;
             catheter and infusion pump implants unsuitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any history of clinically significant head trauma or cerebrovascular disease or recent&#xD;
             history (within previous 2 years) of drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain within&#xD;
             3 months before the implantation procedure that indicates the presence of a central&#xD;
             nervous system abnormality that may interfere with the assessments of safety or&#xD;
             biologic effect in this protocol, or represent a surgical risk to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The presence of an intracranial shunt or catheter system other than the one used in&#xD;
             this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any medical disability, condition or laboratory abnormality (e.g., severe degenerative&#xD;
             arthritis, compromised nutritional state, body weight less than 15% of ideal, Na less&#xD;
             than 130 (grade 3 or above), cardiovascular disease) that would be deemed likely to&#xD;
             increase risk of participation in the protocol or interfere with assessment of the&#xD;
             safety and biologic effect of study materials, the chronic implantation of catheters&#xD;
             and infusion pumps, or would compromise the ability of the subject to give informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known allergy to E coli-derived products or history of anaphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment with an investigational agent or used an investigational device within 60&#xD;
             days before the first dose of study material, other than those described in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
