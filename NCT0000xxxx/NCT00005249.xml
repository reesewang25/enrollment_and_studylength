      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin levels are consistently related to blood pressure, obesity, and blood lipids. Insulin&#xD;
      level correlation with sodium-lithium countertransport is limited to only one available study&#xD;
      done in white, normotensive, predominantly normal weight women aged 45-52. The relationship&#xD;
      between cellular sodium-hydrogen exchange activity and hypertension has been studied in rats&#xD;
      and in a small study in humans. Correlation of this transport with weight, fasting insulin&#xD;
      and lipid levels, and sodium-lithium countertransport was not available in 1989.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was cross-sectional. Subjects were stratified by weight: plus or minus 10 percent&#xD;
      of desirable weight; 11 to 30 percent over desirable weight; and 30 percent over desirable&#xD;
      weight; and by diastolic blood pressure: 80; 80-89; 90-99 mmHg. Blood pressure, height,&#xD;
      weight, waist and hip girth, skinfold, fasting and post-glucose load insulin, glucose,&#xD;
      lipids, creatinine, maximal rates of red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransport and&#xD;
      platelet sodium-hydrogen exchange, pH, and calcium concentrations were measured. The strength&#xD;
      and independence among these continuous variables were measured by Pearson correlations,&#xD;
      partial correlations, and multiple regressions within each stratum, and if appropriate, over&#xD;
      all strata. The study examined the hypotheses that: part of the relationship between obesity&#xD;
      and blood pressure was due to insulin effects and/or lipid effects on ion transport; the&#xD;
      relationship between ion transport and blood pressure was related to an abnormality of&#xD;
      sodium-hydrogen exchange, for which the observed increase in sodium-lithium countertransport&#xD;
      was a marker; increased blood pressure was related to the alteration of intracellular pH&#xD;
      and/or calcium concentration.&#xD;
