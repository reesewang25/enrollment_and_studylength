      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic studies in the acute stage of myocardial infarction have shown complete&#xD;
      occlusion in 75-85 percent and subtotal lesions in the remaining cases. Evidence for spasm in&#xD;
      acutely occluded arteries has been reported. However, the majority of pathological as well as&#xD;
      intraoperative examinations have yielded thrombotic material at the site of complete&#xD;
      obstruction. Indirect evidence of thrombotic material was provided by successful&#xD;
      intracoronary thrombolysis in 80 percent of infarct patients with complete obstruction. There&#xD;
      could be causative relationships between spasm, intimal damage and coronary thrombosis.&#xD;
      Selective applications of spasmolytic and/or thrombolytic substances into occluded vessels&#xD;
      enabled high local concentrations with doses that caused little or no systemic effect.&#xD;
      Angiographic verification of the results of this pharmacotherapy would help to clarify the&#xD;
      role of spasm and thrombus in the pathogenesis of the acute coronary occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reperfusion in man has been achieved by coronary by-pass surgery in the acute stage of&#xD;
      infarction. Follow-up angiography revealed significant improvement of left ventricular&#xD;
      function. Intracoronary streptokinase infusion resulted in recanalization of acute coronary&#xD;
      occlusion in 80 percent of cases within 20-30 minutes of infusion time. Reperfusion achieved&#xD;
      by intervention angiography has been associated with improved local wall motion as well as&#xD;
      improved left ventricular function. Improvement in left ventricular function depended on the&#xD;
      duration of symptoms prior to reperfusion and on the presence or absence of collateral blood&#xD;
      flow. Available data suggested that improvement was more likely to occur if reperfusion was&#xD;
      achieved within 3-4 hours. However, since the majority of patients reached the hospital after&#xD;
      greater than 4 hours of chest pain, study of functional changes following late reperfusion&#xD;
      was of great practical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a randomized trial of myocardial reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction by&#xD;
      selective intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin and/or intracoronary infusion of&#xD;
      streptokinase. The trial was single-blinded as to the interventional therapy; it was&#xD;
      double-blinded as to the drug infused. The primary endpoint was the ejection fraction on the&#xD;
      10th day of intervention. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment arms: an&#xD;
      intracoronary infusion of streptokinase; an intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin; combined&#xD;
      infusions of nitroglycerin and streptokinase; a control group receiving conventional therapy&#xD;
      without acute catheterization. All patients underwent anticoagulant therapy with intravenous&#xD;
      heparin followed by warfarin for three months. Patients were followed for a minimum of two&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
