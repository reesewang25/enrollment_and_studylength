      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Motexafin&#xD;
      gadolinium may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy by making tumor cells more&#xD;
      sensitive to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of motexafin gadolinium plus radiation&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of motexafin gadolinium in combination&#xD;
      with radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the&#xD;
      intratumoral pharmacology and quantitative pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium. Patients&#xD;
      receive a loading dose regimen comprising motexafin gadolinium IV over 10-15 minutes on days&#xD;
      1-5 or days 1-5 and 8-12 (cohort 7). After the loading dose regimen, patients receive a&#xD;
      maintenance regimen comprising motexafin gadolinium IV 3 times weekly for a maximum of 6.5&#xD;
      weeks. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6.5 weeks. Cohorts&#xD;
      of 3-6 patients receive an escalating number of doses of motexafin gadolinium until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at&#xD;
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and&#xD;
      then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
