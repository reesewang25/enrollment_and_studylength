    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with that of&#xD;
      observation following radiation therapy, combination chemotherapy, and peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
      cells. Giving interleukin-2 after radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation may kill more cancer cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the survival and disease-free survival of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
      treated with post-transplant therapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or no further treatment.&#xD;
      Transplant therapy is total body irradiation (TBI), high-dose etoposide, cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the frequency and severity of toxicity associated with post-transplant IL-2&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      disease grade (low vs intermediate vs high), chemosensitive disease (yes vs no), partial or&#xD;
      complete response after initial induction chemotherapy (yes vs no), and performance status&#xD;
      (0-1 vs 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested before study entry.&#xD;
      Patients undergo total body irradiation twice a day on days -8 to -5, high-dose etoposide IV&#xD;
      over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day -2. PBSC are reinfused on&#xD;
      day 0 and then filgrastim (G-CSF) may be administered subcutaneously or IV on days 0-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Within 28-80 days after PBSC transplantation and after recovery from any toxic&#xD;
      effects, patients with no active recurrent or progressive disease are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 IV continuously on days 1-4 and 9-18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients undergo observation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 275 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5-5.9&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

             institutional upper limit of normal measured after completion of prior therapy and&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate pulmonary function as measured by a DLCO &gt;= 65% of&#xD;
             predicted or FEV1 &gt;= 65% of predicted measured after completion of prior therapy and&#xD;

             prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone previous bone marrow transplantation or autologous&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have LDH performed within 28 days prior to registration and at least 21&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If day 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next&#xD;
             working day; in calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or&#xD;
             measurement is done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the&#xD;
             Monday four weeks later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient&#xD;
             scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell (or squamous&#xD;
             cell) skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer or other cancer for which the patient has&#xD;
