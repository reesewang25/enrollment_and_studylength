  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound to examine changes in&#xD;
      tongue volume and blood circulation during tongue exercises that require the use of different&#xD;
      tongue muscle movements and contractions. More information on the structure and function of&#xD;
      the human tongue is needed to develop better treatments for people with certain diseases&#xD;
      affecting speech and swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers between 21 and 80 years old who live in the metropolitan Washington, D.C.,&#xD;
      area may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief medical history&#xD;
      and physical examination, including suitability for MRI testing, and a brief examination of&#xD;
      tongue, lip and jaw movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo ultrasound and MRI studies. During both tests, they will perform&#xD;
      tongue exercises, such as holding a soft round object on the tongue or exerting tongue&#xD;
      pressure against the back of the throat or roof of the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the ultrasound, the subject lies on a flattened dental chair. A small transducer is&#xD;
      placed under the chin to take images of the tongue during the exercises. A thin rubber strip&#xD;
      with air-filled pressure bulbs is attached to the roof of the mouth (with dental adhesive) to&#xD;
      measure tongue pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the MRI, the subject lies on a table that slides inside a donut's machine containing a&#xD;
      magnetic field. MRI coils-special padded sensors that improve image quality-are placed around&#xD;
      the head and neck. A pressure cuff placed around the arm measures blood pressure. The subject&#xD;
      wears earplugs to muffle loud thumping noises that occur during electrical switching of the&#xD;
      magnetic fields. The subject is in constant visual contact with the researchers and MR&#xD;
      technologist and may request to stop the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may undergo another procedure, called magnetic resonance diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging, to examine how the fluid (water) in the tongue tissue shifts during tongue&#xD;
      maneuvers. This procedure is essentially the same as the first MRI study, but two small round&#xD;
      coils are placed in the mouth (one on each side) between the cheeks and the teeth.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As an organ unparalleled in anatomical architecture, the tongue has the versatility to effect&#xD;
      regional deformations and positional changes with multiple potential degrees of freedom.&#xD;
      Despite an abundance of studies on the tongue and its functions, as well as numerous proposed&#xD;
      tongue models over the years, much of the anatomical and biomechanical details of the in vivo&#xD;
      human tongue remain poorly understood. Physiologically based biomechanical modeling of the&#xD;
      tongue in swallowing is the ultimate objective of this protocol. However, before such&#xD;
      modeling can be accurately pursued, a substantial database must be established, and several&#xD;
      important, unaddressed issues regarding lingual anatomy and biomechanics must be resolved.&#xD;
      These issues include: (1) the compressibility of the human tongue and its common, yet&#xD;
      untested, reference as a muscular hydrostat; (2) task induced interactions between lingual&#xD;
      musculature and vasculature and region-specific vascular demands; (3) changes in lingual&#xD;
      fiber orientation, length, and strain distribution as a function of contraction tasks; and&#xD;
      (4) effects of normal aging, disease processes, and task training on lingual myoarchitecture&#xD;
      as well as the integration between structure and function. Using advanced 3D MRI, Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography, and other MR imaging techniques (e.g., tagged MRI, diffusion tensor MRI),&#xD;
      this protocol proposes to quantitatively address these issues and contribute to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the functional biomechanical as well as myoarchitectural intricacies of the&#xD;
      in vivo human tongue.&#xD;
