    <textblock>
      Some children with certain language disorders may not properly process the sounds they hear,&#xD;
      resulting in language impairments. The purpose of this study is to determine if deficits in&#xD;
      auditory temporal processing the way the brain analyzes the timing and patterns of sounds are&#xD;
      an inherited trait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families with auditory temporal processing deficits are sought in order to identify the genes&#xD;
      responsible for auditory temporal processing deficits. Children and adults with a diagnosis&#xD;
      or history of language impairment in the family and their family members both affected and&#xD;
      non-affected are eligible for this two-part study. In Part 1, participants undergo a series&#xD;
      of language tests and listening tests to measure various characteristics of how they perceive&#xD;
      sound. In Part 2, they are interviewed about language disorders, learning disabilities, and&#xD;
      other medical problems of family members. This information is used to construct a pedigree&#xD;
      (family tree diagram) showing the pattern of inheritance of family traits. Study subjects&#xD;
      whose pedigree indicates that language disorders may be hereditary in their family will&#xD;
      provide either a small blood sample (1 to 2 tablespoons) or a tissue specimen obtained from a&#xD;
      cheek swab (rubbing the inside of the cheek with a small brush or cotton swabs). The sample&#xD;
      will be used to isolate DNA for genetic analysis.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research implicates auditory processing deficits in the etiology of language&#xD;
      impairments, but no standard methodology has been employed to determine whether auditory&#xD;
      processing deficits are heritable traits. We will investigate whether auditory processing&#xD;
      skills and auditory processing disorders (APDs) are hereditary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study same-sex twins (healthy volunteers) and individuals who score in the top or&#xD;
      bottom 10th percentile on auditory processing tests and their first-degree family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A Two-Phase, Staged Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach uses the two classical methods of demonstrating heritability: comparison of&#xD;
      monozygotic (MZ) to dizygotic (DZ) concordance rates in twins and measuring familial&#xD;
      aggregation of a trait. While there are a variety of auditory processing tests in common use,&#xD;
      there is no standard battery of tests for the diagnosis of APD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the normal variation in performance on many of these tests is not known. We will&#xD;
      systematically evaluate tests of auditory processing for variation in the general population&#xD;
      and for evidence of heritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Twin study&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate a variety of auditory processing tests in MZ and same-sex DZ twins. This&#xD;
      initial phase of the study is designed to provide data so that the performance of MZ twin&#xD;
      pairs can be compared to the performance of DZ twin pairs. Statistical modeling will be used&#xD;
      to estimate the relative contributions of heredity and environment to auditory processing&#xD;
      skills. In addition, we will examine variation in auditory processing skills in the general&#xD;
      population of twins. This will allow us to identify auditory processing skills and tests that&#xD;
      have the greatest heritable components, and to establish normative data for the tests we&#xD;
      administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Family aggregation study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the outcomes of Phase 1, auditory processing tests of skills with the highest&#xD;
      heritable component will be selected for evaluation of probands. Those who score in the top&#xD;
      and bottom 10th percentile will be eligible for participation as probands in this phase of&#xD;
      the study. Variation of these skills in the general population, as determined by the twin&#xD;
      data (Phase 1) or published norms, when they are available, will be used to determine the top&#xD;
      and bottom 10th percentiles. This same test set will be administered to probands and at least&#xD;
      two first-degree relatives allowing us to determine whether traits related to auditory&#xD;
      processing occur within the family at a rate greater than chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 outcome measures will be individual performance on tests of auditory processing&#xD;
      skills and comparative performance of MZ and DZ co-twin pairs on these tests. Phase II&#xD;
      outcome measures will be the performance on auditory processing measures of probands and&#xD;
      their family members, and affectance rates observed in these families.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
