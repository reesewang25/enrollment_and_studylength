      RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy may&#xD;
      fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. It is not yet known which&#xD;
      androgen suppression regimen is more effective for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two hormone therapy regimens and&#xD;
      comparing them to see how well they work in treating patients with rising PSA levels&#xD;
      following radiation therapy for prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the survival of prostate cancer patients with prostate-specific antigen&#xD;
           progression in the clinical absence of distant metastases after prior radical&#xD;
           radiotherapy treated with intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) vs continuous androgen&#xD;
           deprivation (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the time to the development of hormone resistance in patients treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the serum cholesterol and HDL/LDL levels at 3 years with those at baseline and&#xD;
           compare them annually in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the duration of treatment and non-treatment intervals, time to testosterone&#xD;
           recovery (return to pre-therapy levels), and time to recover potency in patients treated&#xD;
           with IAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy (yes vs no), time since completion of prior radical radiotherapy (1 to&#xD;
      3 years vs 3 years or more), baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (3-15 ng/mL vs&#xD;
      greater than 15 ng/mL), and prior hormonal therapy (neo-adjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant&#xD;
      cytoreduction in association with the radical radiotherapy treatment or prostatectomy for a&#xD;
      maximum duration of 12 months and completed at least 12 months prior to randomization) (yes&#xD;
      vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients undergo intermittent androgen suppression (IAS). Patients receive&#xD;
           luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog (buserelin [BSRL], goserelin [ZDX],&#xD;
           or leuprolide [LEUP]) and an antiandrogen (nilutamide [ANAN], flutamide [FLUT],&#xD;
           bicalutamide [CDX], or cyproterone acetate [CPTR]) for 8 months. Patients receive LHRH&#xD;
           analog by subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) implant every 1-4 months beginning&#xD;
           within 5 days of randomization and oral antiandrogen 1-3 times daily, depending on the&#xD;
           actual LHRH analog and antiandrogen. PSA levels are monitored every 2 months. If PSA&#xD;
           falls to normal during the 8-month treatment period, therapy stops until levels rise to&#xD;
           10 ng/mL, at which time IAS resumes for another 8-month period. IAS continues as long as&#xD;
           PSA levels are controlled. At the time of disease progression, patients begin continuous&#xD;
           hormonal treatment similar to arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients undergo continuous androgen deprivation without scheduled&#xD;
           interruptions. Patients receive LHRH analog (BSRL, ZDX, or LEUP) with an antiandrogen&#xD;
           (ANAN, FLUT, CDX, or CPTR) OR undergo bilateral orchiectomy within 5 days of&#xD;
           randomization and receive an antiandrogen. Patients receive LHRH analog by SC or IM&#xD;
           implant every 1-4 months beginning within 5 days of randomization and oral antiandrogen&#xD;
           1-3 times daily, depending on the actual LHRH analog and antiandrogen. PSA levels are&#xD;
           monitored every 2 months. Treatment continues until hormone resistance develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving LHRH analog may begin antiandrogen therapy either prior to or&#xD;
      simultaneously with LHRH analog and must continue antiandrogen therapy for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
      to block tumor flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at randomization, every 4 months for 2 years, every 8 months&#xD;
      until development of hormone resistance, at the time of hormone resistance, and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed annually for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,386 patients will be accrued for this study within 7 years.&#xD;
