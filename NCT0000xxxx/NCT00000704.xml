  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of the drug 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (&#xD;
      zalcitabine; ddC ) in treating patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex ( ARC ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies show that a certain group of drugs (dideoxynucleosides) are effective in&#xD;
      treating patients with HIV infection. ddC is a dideoxynucleoside and test tube studies show&#xD;
      that it may be valuable in treating AIDS patients. ddC has been shown to be well tolerated in&#xD;
      certain patients with AIDS.&#xD;

      Recent studies show that a certain group of drugs (dideoxynucleosides) are effective in&#xD;
      treating patients with HIV infection. ddC is a dideoxynucleoside and test tube studies show&#xD;
      that it may be valuable in treating AIDS patients. ddC has been shown to be well tolerated in&#xD;
      certain patients with AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of doses of ddC is given to patients with AIDS and ARC. Eight patients with AIDS and&#xD;
      eight patients with ARC are given ddC at the lowest level for 12 weeks. Patients who respond&#xD;
      with a rise in their number of T4 cells or with a fall in HIV antigen in their serum (the&#xD;
      fluid portion of the blood) are continued at that dose for an additional 12 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      who do not respond at a given dose level (no rise in T4 or fall in serum HIV antigen) stop&#xD;
      treatment at 12 weeks. All patients are followed off therapy for 4 weeks. As each dose level&#xD;
      is found to be well tolerated for 10 weeks in five of the eight patients in each group,&#xD;
      additional patients will be entered at higher dose levels until eight AIDS and eight ARC&#xD;
      patients are receiving the drug at a given level.&#xD;
