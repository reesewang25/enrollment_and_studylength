  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if laparoscopy can be used successfully to find and remove&#xD;
      insulinomas (insulin-secreting tumors of the pancreas). These tumors are very small and often&#xD;
      difficult to locate with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) or&#xD;
      ultrasound. Invasive procedures, such as arteriograms (X-ray imaging using a contrast agent&#xD;
      injected into the bloodstream through a catheter) and venous sampling are more successful but&#xD;
      involve more patient discomfort and greater risk. This study will test whether laparoscopy&#xD;
      can be used to replace some or all of these tests, as well as more extensive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 11 years of age and older with low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) probably caused by an&#xD;
      insulinoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have their hypoglycemia confirmed&#xD;
      (with tests done under NIH protocol 91-DK-0066: Diagnosis and Treatment of Hypoglycemia) and&#xD;
      will have CT imaging of the abdomen and MRI and ultrasound tests of the liver and pancreas.&#xD;
      Patients whose tumors are not found by these studies will undergo arteriography of the&#xD;
      pancreas and hepatic (liver) venous sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then have laparoscopy. This surgical procedure uses a laparoscope-a tube-like&#xD;
      device with special cameras and an ultrasound probe attached through which the surgeon can&#xD;
      see and operate inside the abdomen. Laparoscopy is commonly done to remove the gallbladder&#xD;
      and is also used to remove portions of the pancreas. For the current procedure, the surgeon&#xD;
      makes small incisions in the abdomen, inserts tubes, fills the abdomen with gas, and proceeds&#xD;
      to explore and operate on the pancreas. The surgeon will try to locate the tumor with the&#xD;
      laparoscope. If the tumor is found, the location will be verified by the imaging study&#xD;
      results. If it cannot be located by laparoscopy, the results of the imaging studies will be&#xD;
      disclosed to enable removal. If the tumor cannot be successfully removed using the&#xD;
      laparoscope, standard surgery will then be performed. If the tumor cannot be found though&#xD;
      laparoscopy, imaging studies, or traditional surgery, the operation will be concluded without&#xD;
      removing any of the pancreas. Medical treatment will be initiated and re-evaluation will be&#xD;
      recommended after 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with the clinical diagnosis of hypoglycemia secondary to a putative insulin&#xD;
      secreting pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor require accurate localization of the tumor and&#xD;
      definitive surgical resection. Non-invasive pre-operative imaging studies such as CT, MRI and&#xD;
      ultrasound often fail to accurately localize the lesion prior to surgery. Invasive imaging&#xD;
      such as arteriogram and selective arterial stimulation are a major improvement, but may not&#xD;
      be needed in all patients. This trial will evaluate the ability of laparoscopic exploration&#xD;
      with intraoperative ultrasound to localize the insulinoma and allow for its resection with a&#xD;
      single procedure.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of symptomatic hypoglycemia due to insulin or proinsulin secretion&#xD;
        presumed to be from an insulinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to return to NIH for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients (or their parents or guardians) must be able to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or Von-Hipple-Lindau&#xD;
        (VHL) syndrome or any history of a familial neuroendocrine tumor syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        pregnancy or breast-feeding. A negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) is required prior&#xD;
        to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known allergy to contrast agents and contraindications to or failure of pretreatment with&#xD;
        prednisone, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine per standard procedure to prevent such&#xD;
        reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of metastatic disease by CT, MRI or US.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelet count less than 50,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical condition which would preclude surgery including moderate to severe chronic lung&#xD;
        disease that may be worsened by gas insufflation of the abdomen.&#xD;
