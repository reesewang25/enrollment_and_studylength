      RATIONALE: AE-941 may stop the growth of kidney cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of AE-941 in treating&#xD;
      patients who have metastatic kidney cancer that has not responded to biological therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma refractory&#xD;
      to immunotherapy treated with AE-941 (Neovastat) versus placebo. II. Compare the time to&#xD;
      progression and one-year survival rate of patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine&#xD;
      the safety of this regimen in these patients. IV. Compare the overall tumor response rate,&#xD;
      duration of response, and quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients&#xD;
      are stratified according to number of organs with metastases (1 vs more than 1) and ECOG&#xD;
      performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:&#xD;
      Patients receive oral AE-941 (Neovastat) twice a day. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo&#xD;
      twice a day. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease&#xD;
      progression. Quality of life is assessed on day 1 and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients&#xD;
      are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression and then every 8 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.&#xD;
