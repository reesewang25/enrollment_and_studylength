      RATIONALE: White blood cells from donors may be able to kill cancer cells in patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma that has recurred following bone marrow transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving donor white blood cells works in&#xD;
      treating patients with recurrent multiple myeloma who have undergone bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the response rate of patients with recurrent multiple myeloma after an allogeneic&#xD;
           marrow transplant from a genotypically HLA identical sibling donor treated with donor&#xD;
           lymphocyte infusions as salvage therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicity of this treatment when used as salvage therapy in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive initial cell dose of donor lymphocytes (CD3+ cells) IV over 15-30&#xD;
      minutes. Patients with rapidly progressive disease may skip the initial cell dose and proceed&#xD;
      directly to dose escalation to receive CD3+ cells at a higher cell dose. Patients who achieve&#xD;
      complete response to the initial treatment may receive up to 2 additional courses of&#xD;
      escalating doses of CD3+ cells 8-12 weeks apart in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks after each infusion. Patients with disease&#xD;
      progression at 8 weeks are retreated at that time. Patients who achieve partial response or&#xD;
      stable disease at 8 weeks are re-evaluated at 12 weeks and may then be retreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 3 months, once a month for 9 months, and then every 2&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.&#xD;

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or persistent multiple myeloma at least 6 months&#xD;
             following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA identical sibling&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must meet one of following criteria to be considered persistent, recurrent, or&#xD;
             progressive disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual detectable disease 6-12 months after BMT, as determined by the M protein&#xD;
                  level or bone marrow involvement, without further evidence of clinical or&#xD;
                  laboratory improvement on 2 consecutive measurements 4 weeks apart&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete response not achieved 12 or more months after BMT and there is no&#xD;
                  evidence of progressive improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 25% increase of serum paraprotein (greater than 1.0 g/dL) as measured on&#xD;
                  two occasions or a 50% increase in urinary light chain excretion (greater than&#xD;
                  150 mg/day) as measured on 2 occasions&#xD;
