  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dilution of blood caused by cardiopulmonary bypass (the heart-lung machine) during open heart&#xD;
      surgery is associated with decreased concentrations in the blood of coagulation factors. This&#xD;
      can be extreme in infants because of their small blood volumes and can lead to impairment of&#xD;
      the normal blood clotting mechanism and excessive bleeding after the operation. Transfusion&#xD;
      of fresh whole blood has been shown to be an effective treatment because fresh blood is rich&#xD;
      in coagulation factors. However, it is difficult to obtain truly fresh blood from a blood&#xD;
      bank. We hypothesized that fresh blood drawn from the patient and given back after&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass would improve the clotting mechanism. In our study, the infants in the&#xD;
      treatment group have some of their own fresh blood removed after they are anesthetized for&#xD;
      the operation and before they are placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. This blood is then given&#xD;
      back to them after completion of cardiopulmonary bypass. Infants in the control group will&#xD;
      not have their own blood removed but will undergo cardiopulmonary bypass. We will compare the&#xD;
      two groups by drawing blood samples that measure coagulation tests.&#xD;
