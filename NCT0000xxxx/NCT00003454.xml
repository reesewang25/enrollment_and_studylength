      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the&#xD;
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating&#xD;
      women who have stage IV breast cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which patients with Stage IV breast&#xD;
      cancer receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal +&#xD;
      Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to12 months in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage IV breast&#xD;
           cancer, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial&#xD;
           response or stable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage&#xD;
           IV breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are&#xD;
           performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth&#xD;
           years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with Stage IV Breast Cancer will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal).&#xD;
The daily doses of A10 and AS2-1 are divided into six infusions, which are given at 4-hourly intervals. Each infusion starts with infusion of A10 and is immediately followed by infusion of AS2-1.</description>
