      THIS STUDY HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fluoxetine for treating children&#xD;
      and adolescents with Bipolar Disorder who are experiencing an episode of major depression&#xD;
      while being treated with a mood stabilizer. The study involves a 2-week assessment period.&#xD;
      Patients who are on stable, therapeutic doses of lithium or valproate and continue to have&#xD;
      depression will be randomized to a 12-week treatment of fluoxetine or placebo. Those who&#xD;
      respond favorably to treatment will be followed openly for an 18-week continuation phase.&#xD;

      This NIMH sponsored study is being done to determine the safety and efficacy of a selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (Prozac), compared to placebo in the&#xD;
      treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder who, while taking a mood&#xD;
      stabilizer, are currently experiencing an episode of major depression. Bipolar disorder is a&#xD;
      recurrent, episodic illness with key features of severe mood swings from one extreme&#xD;
      (depression) to the other extreme (mania). These mood swings and associated symptoms are not&#xD;
      similar to the normal mood changes that individuals experience from time to time. A person&#xD;
      suffering from bipolar disorder, while in an episode of depression or mania, experiences&#xD;
      problems in their functioning in several different areas in his or her life such as&#xD;
      interpersonal, social, academic and occupational. Symptoms of depression include sad or&#xD;
      irritable mood, sleep and appetite disturbances, trouble concentrating, inability to enjoy&#xD;
      things that are normally fun, feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, withdrawal from family and&#xD;
      friends, suicidal ideation. Symptoms of mania include extremely happy or irritable mood,&#xD;
      little need for sleep, poor judgment, continuous high energy, overconfidence, racing&#xD;
      thoughts, increase in social interactions, frequent or constant thoughts about sex. There are&#xD;
      varying degrees and types of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric bipolar disorder is now recognized as a significant health problem. Studies of&#xD;
      adults have shown that approximately 40% of bipolar patients started to suffer from this&#xD;
      disorder during their teens. Bipolar disorder is usually treated with medications, such as&#xD;
      lithium or valproate (Depakote), to stabilize the mood swings. Sometimes people with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder experience depression, even when they are taking a mood stabilizer medication. When&#xD;
      this happens, an antidepressant medication may need to be added to treat the depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. The current practice for treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents&#xD;
      in the depressed phase follows treatment guidelines developed for adults, but it is unknown&#xD;
      whether these treatment strategies are appropriate for children and teens. Few studies have&#xD;
      been done in youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluoxetine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of&#xD;
      depression, bulimia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults, but not in children or&#xD;
      adolescents. Previous research has shown that fluoxetine is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      periods of depression, however, in this study the investigators are evaluating whether it is&#xD;
      effective for periods of depression associated with bipolar disorders. In this study, about&#xD;
      100 children and adolescents (ages 8-18 years) who are taking lithium carbonate or valproate&#xD;
      (Depakote) and are experiencing depression will be randomized to receive fluoxetine (Prozac)&#xD;
      or placebo for 12 weeks. Weekly visits to the clinic are necessary for participation to&#xD;
      ensure safety. At the end of the 12 weeks there is an 18-week open treatment period, which&#xD;
      will involve clinic visits at least monthly. Those who were taking fluoxetine and improved&#xD;
      will continue taking the fluoxetine during this time period. Those who did not improve will&#xD;
      either receive an increased dose of fluoxetine or will be assigned to a different medication.&#xD;
      Those who were taking placebo and did not improve will be offered treatment with fluoxetine&#xD;
      and those who improved with placebo will continue taking only lithium or valproate.&#xD;
