    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of stavudine (d4T),&#xD;
      didanosine (ddI), and BMS-232632 when given early in the course of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute HIV infection may develop in patients that are exposed to the HIV virus. Following&#xD;
      infection, the viral load (level of HIV in the blood) rises rapidly over the next few days to&#xD;
      weeks. It is not known which is the best treatment in patients with very early HIV infection.&#xD;
      Researchers believe these patients may respond well to strong early treatment. A combination&#xD;
      consisting of enteric-coated didanosine (ddI-EC), stavudine (d4T), and the HIV-1 protease&#xD;
      inhibitor, BMS-232632, will be tested.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) follows exposure to the HIV-1 virus and results in a&#xD;
      rapid rise in plasma viremia within days to 1 to 3 weeks. Individuals with acute PHI or early&#xD;
      HIV-1 infection represent a potentially unique patient population in which to evaluate potent&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapies because of the degree of viral heterogeneity and the fact that&#xD;
      immunologic disruption is likely to be lower than in later stages of HIV-1 disease. The&#xD;
      optimal treatment for acute PHI is unknown. This study evaluates a regimen consisting of&#xD;
      enteric-coated didanosine (ddI-EC), stavudine (d4T), and the HIV-1 protease inhibitor,&#xD;
      BMS-232632.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are enrolled into Group I or Group II and may participate in substudies. Patients in&#xD;
      Group I receive ddI-EC, d4T, and BMS-232632 daily for 52 weeks. Clinical, virologic, and&#xD;
      immunologic evaluations are performed on Days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28, then every 4 weeks&#xD;
      through Week 24, and then every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 48. Based on laboratory&#xD;
      results from the Week 48 visit, a decision is made by Week 52 whether or not to continue&#xD;
      study medications for an additional 52 weeks. Evaluation schedules for those patients&#xD;
      enrolled in substudies may be different. Group II patients elect not to receive&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment and are followed as a natural history disease group to be compared&#xD;
      with patients in Group I. They are followed according to the same schedule of evaluations as&#xD;
      those enrolled in Group I, unless otherwise specified as part of their participation in&#xD;
      substudies. All patients are followed in this study at 8-week intervals for a total duration&#xD;
      of 104 weeks (2 years). HIV will be measured in plasma and tissues to determine reduction in&#xD;
      replication for a duration of at least 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 substudies in which patients may participate are AI-03-006, Lymphoid Tissue Substudy;&#xD;
      AI-03-007, Immunology Substudy of cytolytic and co-stimulatory markers, T-cell repertoire,&#xD;
      and cytokine and chemokine elaboration; and AI-03-008, Viral Dynamics and Diversity Substudy.&#xD;
