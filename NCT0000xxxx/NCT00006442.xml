  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the HIV virus in the blood and lymphoid tissues of&#xD;
      patients taking anti-HIV medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infection is closely linked to the growth of the HIV virus in the body. Much of this&#xD;
      information was obtained from studying how the HIV virus grows in circulating blood. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that the lymphoid tissue (part of the immune system) is a major site where&#xD;
      HIV is found in the body and is also where much of the HIV virus growth occurs. This study&#xD;
      will examine not only blood but also lymphoid tissue to gain a better understanding of the&#xD;
      disease and how to treat it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The natural history and pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection are linked closely to the replication&#xD;
      of virus in the body. Studies obtained entirely from analyses of peripheral blood led to a&#xD;
      shift in the understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that lymphoid&#xD;
      tissues are a major reservoir for HIV and the primary site of virus replication. The proposed&#xD;
      studies will provide the first comprehensive assessment of HIV-1 expression and lymphocyte&#xD;
      response in both blood and lymphocyte tissue compartments. The data obtained will provide new&#xD;
      insight into HIV-1 pathogenesis and provide a more rational basis for treatment decisions&#xD;
      concerning early therapy of HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are admitted to the hospital for insertion of an angiocath to collect blood samples&#xD;
      periodically over 48 hours on the day study medication from the parent study is initiated.&#xD;
      After discharge, additional blood samples are obtained over a 6-month period. Within 7 days&#xD;
      prior to a scheduled biopsy, patients have physical examinations and laboratory evaluations&#xD;
      done. All patients undergo some combination of the following during the 2-week prestudy&#xD;
      evaluation period and at Weeks 4 and 24: a) superficial lymph node biopsy from cervical,&#xD;
      axillary, or inguinal area; b) rectal biopsy; and/or c) tonsillar biopsy. The tissue samples&#xD;
      provide an assessment of viral and cellular dynamics.&#xD;
