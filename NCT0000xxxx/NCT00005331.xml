      To conduct a randomized controlled smoking prevention trial to evaluate quality of&#xD;
      implementation and effectiveness, as a function of provider type (school teacher vs. nurse)&#xD;
      and training (mediated vs. interactive).&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compared smoking prevention in junior high schools and in high schools either&#xD;
      receiving or not receiving a school-wide community intervention. The junior high school&#xD;
      curriculum was delivered to all volunteers in grades 6, 7, and 8 in each intervention school.&#xD;
      All participants were tested five times: midway through grade 6 before the intervention&#xD;
      began, and at the end of grades 7,8,9, and 10. The primary endpoint was self-reported smoking&#xD;
      status at the ends of grades 8 and 10. The validity of smoking reports was enhanced with&#xD;
      collection of breath carbon monoxide samples for all subjects at all test points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was extended for an additional three years to add to the three year, junior high,&#xD;
      design a two arm comparison between high schools either receiving or not receiving a&#xD;
      school-wide, community, intervention. The new high school intervention responded to both&#xD;
      recent evidence of long term decay in junior high program effectiveness, and a trend toward&#xD;
      greater high school smoking onset most notably among females. Secondary objectives for this&#xD;
      Demonstration and Education research included (a) a test of the hypothesis that higher levels&#xD;
      of implementation were associated with better outcomes; (b) preparation for diffusion of a&#xD;
      complete set of curriculum, provider training, program implementation, and evaluation methods&#xD;
      and materials; and (c) study of the effects of school environment on program effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred junior high schools were randomly selected and assigned, 20 per condition, and&#xD;
      some 5,000 Grade 6 youth with approximately the same number of females and males, recruited&#xD;
      to cohort which participated in intervention and evaluation through the end of Grade 10. The&#xD;
      junior high curriculum was delivered to all volunteers in each intervention school in Grades&#xD;
      6, 7, and 8. All participants were tested five times: midway through Grade 6 before the&#xD;
      intervention began, and at the end of Grades 7, 8, 9 and 10. The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      self-reported smoking status at the ends of Grades 8 and 10, 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 years after the&#xD;
      intervention began. The validity of smoking reports were enhanced with collection of breath&#xD;
      carbon monoxide samples from all subjects at all test points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new high school intervention integrated three approaches: attitude-behavior change&#xD;
      strategies derived from social psychological research on dissonance, self-perception, values,&#xD;
      social norms, and commitment; organizational/cultural change strategies using student- driven&#xD;
      participatory planning and multilevel change methods; and mobilization strategies adapted&#xD;
      from the National Cancer Institute-funded Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation&#xD;
      (COMMIT). A comprehensive implementation evaluation used direct observation, multiple sources&#xD;
      of self-report, program records, and cost data to assess the relationships between&#xD;
      implementation, outcome, and cost- effectiveness; to provide direct measures of training and&#xD;
      mobilization effects; and to develop feasible implementation evaluation methodology for&#xD;
      future diffusion studies.&#xD;
