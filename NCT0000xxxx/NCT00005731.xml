      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a serious chronic disease affecting about 12 million Americans; about 3 million are&#xD;
      children. The study was part of an initiative, &quot;Developing and Implementing at the State and&#xD;
      Local Level Educational Strategies and Interventions for Controlling Asthma in Inner City and&#xD;
      High Risk Populations&quot;, released in February 1993 by the National Asthma Education Program of&#xD;
      the Office of Prevention, Education and Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-assisted multimedia instructional and feedback system, &quot;Asthma Patient/Provider&#xD;
      Partnership System&quot; (APPPS), was developed for African American and Hispanic school-age&#xD;
      children that was suited for adoption and implementation in clinical and other settings based&#xD;
      on the National Asthma Education Program's Expert Panel Guidelines on the Diagnosis and&#xD;
      Management of Asthma. A formative evaluation of the educational intervention was conducted.&#xD;
      Also, an efficacy study of the intervention in three clinical settings was conducted and the&#xD;
      findings of this study were incorporated into the APPPS. Finally, a recommended dissemination&#xD;
      strategy was prepared for diffusion of the system to other settings.&#xD;
