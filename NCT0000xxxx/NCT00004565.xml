  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore whether different forms, or variants, of genes are related to a&#xD;
      person s risk of developing breast cancer. The genes that are looked at have no clinical&#xD;
      significance today, and thus will not impact your personal healthcare at this time. However,&#xD;
      these results may help researchers better understand why some people develop breast cancer&#xD;
      and others do not. The study will try to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      if people with breast cancer have different gene variants from people without the disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
      if these genetic differences influence a person s susceptibility to breast cancer when they&#xD;
      are exposed to certain environmental substances, such as nicotine and estrogen; and&#xD;
&#xD;
      if breast cancer that occurs in families is related to a grouping of these variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also look for certain proteins, cells, or other substances in fluid aspirated&#xD;
      (by the use of gentle suction; no needles) from the nipple that might represent a pattern, or&#xD;
      &quot;fingerprint,&quot; indicating increased risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will complete questionnaires on cancer risk factors, diet, and family&#xD;
      history. A small blood sample (3 tablespoons) will be drawn for study of genetic differences&#xD;
      between people with breast cancer and people who are cancer-free. Nipple aspirations, a&#xD;
      noninvasive method to obtain fluid from a women s breast, will be attempted 4 to 6 times,&#xD;
      over a 4 6 week period. For this procedure, the subject places a warm moist towel over the&#xD;
      breasts for about 20 minutes. The breasts are then cleansed with a rubbing alcohol pad. The&#xD;
      subject compresses the breast with both hands and a small plastic cup is inverted over the&#xD;
      breast. Suction is applied to a small syringe (no needles) attached to the cup for about 15&#xD;
      seconds. The procedure may be repeated up to 5 times on each breast. Any drops of fluid&#xD;
      obtained from the nipple will be collected in a glass tube.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer risk, even among those with similar environmental exposures is not uniformly&#xD;
      distributed. Although we have been able to identify genetic factors whose variants appear to&#xD;
      significantly alter an individual's risk of developing breast cancer (BRCA1 and BRCA2), these&#xD;
      genes are likely involved with less than 10% of breast cancer cases. Perhaps more applicable&#xD;
      to the general population are genes which, while not directly involved with the oncogenic&#xD;
      process, may have variants (polymorphisms) which act indirectly by increasing the risk of an&#xD;
      oncogenic change within a cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the goal of this proposal to look at genes, environment, clinical co-factors, and, if&#xD;
      possible, any interactions in breast cancer. The ultimate objective of these studies is to&#xD;
      establish an effective way of identifying individuals at greatest risk for cancer. We will&#xD;
      evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with polymorphisms in genes involved in&#xD;
      estrogen metabolism and action. We will also evaluate the association of breast density and&#xD;
      polymorphisms in genes associated with estrogen metabolism and action. In addition, we will&#xD;
      also evaluate nipple aspirate fluid and breast duct lavage fluid as another potential source&#xD;
      of promising biomarkers of risk.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Case Populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with breast cancer are being ascertained from among the patient population at&#xD;
        National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) as well as other referring institutions. Individuals&#xD;
        from the Clinical Center may also be eligible. There will be three groups of participants,&#xD;
        which include a control group, individuals with a documented history of breast cancer, and&#xD;
        individuals identified to be at high risk of developing breast cancer. The purpose of the&#xD;
        high risk group is to look for potential similarities and differences between the cancer&#xD;
        and control populations that may start to be exhibited in the high risk group. This will&#xD;
        potentially allow the research team to identify high risk women by markers of risk. After&#xD;
        providing informed consent, individuals are asked to donate a blood sample, undergo nipple&#xD;
        fluid sampling, and complete epidemiological, dietary and family history questionnaires and&#xD;
        grant access to their medical records. The questionnaires will be completed and/or reviewed&#xD;
        by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. . Individuals with a documented history of invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. . Individuals with a documented history of ductal carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control and High Risk Populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will use two primary methods for establishing risk status in individuals who are not&#xD;
        affected with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. . Individuals found to harbor a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 face up to a 50-85 percent&#xD;
             lifetime risk for developing breast cancer as well as an increased risk for ovarian&#xD;
             and other cancers that vary dependent on the gene involved. Therefore, individuals&#xD;
             with a documented BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation will be assigned to the high risk population&#xD;
             group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. . For all participants without a history of breast cancer and no documented BRCA1 or&#xD;
             BRCA2 mutation, the computerized Pedigree Assessment Tool (PAT) will be used to&#xD;
             establish control or high risk group assignment. The PAT is capable of identifying&#xD;
             women from families with features suggesting transmission of an autosomal dominant&#xD;
             breast cancer susceptibility allele. The PAT is a simple point scoring system which&#xD;
             assigns point values for each case of breast or ovarian cancer within a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pedigree Assessment Tool Scoring System&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis Points Assigned&#xD;
&#xD;
        Breast Cancer at age 50 or higher 3 Breast cancer prior to age 50 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ovarian Cancer at any age 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male Breast Cancer at any age 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ashkenazi Jewish heritage 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        The PAT score is calculated by adding the points assigned to every family member with a&#xD;
        breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis, including 2nd and 3rd degree relatives. A separate&#xD;
        score is calculated for both the maternal and paternal lineage and the higher of the 2&#xD;
        scores is assigned to the participant. Validation data from this model demonstrate that the&#xD;
        PAT score was more accurate than the modified Gail model at identifying women with a&#xD;
        hereditary risk of breast cancer. Area under the ROC curve for the PAT was 0.9625 compared&#xD;
        to 0.389 and 0.5861 for 5-year and lifetime Gail estimates respectively. a PAT score of&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 8 provided the most accurate discrimination between &quot;high risk&quot;&#xD;
        and &quot;not high risk&quot; women with a sensitivity of 100 percent specificity of 93 positive&#xD;
        predictive value of 63 percent and negative predictive value of 100 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control Populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The control participants have been ascertained from among the low risk screening&#xD;
        population, and from non-cancer clinics and practices of the NNMC and must meet both of the&#xD;
        following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals with no prior history of any malignancy excluding skin cancers (except&#xD;
             melanoma) and cervical cancer in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A PAT score less than 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Gail risk less than 1.67.&#xD;
&#xD;
        High Risk Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order for individuals to be in the high-risk for breast cancer group a subject must&#xD;
        satisfy criterion 1 AND at least one of criteria 2 through 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have no prior history of any malignancy excluding skin cancers (except melanoma) and&#xD;
             cervical cancer in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Gail Model - an estimated risk of greater than 1.66 of developing breast cancer over&#xD;
             the next five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A documented deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A PAT score greater than or equal to 8 .&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of atypical lobular or ductal hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with any active infection or superficial inflammation of the breast, or who are&#xD;
        currently lactating or who are less than 6 months post-lactation will not be eligible to&#xD;
        undergo nipple fluid sampling, however they may still participate in the rest of the study.&#xD;
