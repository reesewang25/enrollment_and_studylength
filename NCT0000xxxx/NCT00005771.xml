  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, physical therapists have begun treating people who have mechanical low back pain,&#xD;
      hypothesized to be caused by segmental instability in the lumbar spine, with a very specific&#xD;
      exercise program consisting of trunk stabilization exercises. The theory behind the use of&#xD;
      trunk stabilization exercises to treat lower back pain is that active contraction of the&#xD;
      trunk local segmental muscles helps to control inter-segmental movement in the spine. The&#xD;
      initial trunk stabilization exercise that physical therapists teach patients is an abdominal&#xD;
      drawing in maneuver often called an abdominal hollowing exercise (AHE). A challenge for&#xD;
      physical therapists is to establish the most effective means of teaching people to contract&#xD;
      the relevant muscles needed to perform the AHE. The purpose of this study is to examine if&#xD;
      supplementing the typical clinical instruction for teaching the AHE with visual ultrasound&#xD;
      feedback to the patient is effective at reducing the length of time it takes an individual to&#xD;
      learn to perform an AHE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of research volunteers will be taught how to do the AHE while receiving&#xD;
      different kinds of feedback about their performance in order to determine which type of&#xD;
      feedback is most effective in assisting people to learn the AHE. Group 1 will not receive any&#xD;
      feedback about performance; Group 2 will receive feedback from palpation and verbal&#xD;
      descriptive alone; and Group 3 will receive feedback from palpation, verbal descriptive&#xD;
      feedback, and real time ultrasound. For the initial test when subjects are learning the AHE,&#xD;
      the number of trials until the subject demonstrates his/her third correct AHE will be the&#xD;
      outcome variable. For the retention test, the outcome variable will be the percentage of&#xD;
      trials (out of ten) of correctly performed AHEs in the absence of visual, verbal or palpation&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
