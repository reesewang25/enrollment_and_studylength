    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 plus interleukin-2 in treating&#xD;
      patients who have advanced solid tumors. Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping&#xD;
      blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining the&#xD;
      two drugs may kill more cancer cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the toxicity profile and MTD of low-dose SC IL-2 administered in conjunction&#xD;
      with BIW regimen of IV rhIL-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the antitumor effects of combination therapy with IV rhIL-12 and SC IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the impact low-dose SC IL-2 has on the magnitude and duration of in vivo&#xD;
      immune activation induced by a BIW schedule of IV rhIL-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) IV on days 1 and 4 for 6 weeks. Beginning on day 4 of&#xD;
      the third week, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously 1 hour before and 20&#xD;
      hours after each dose of IL-12. On subsequent courses, IL-2 and IL-12 are administered on&#xD;
      days 1 and 4 of each week. Treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease response may continue treatment&#xD;
      until complete response or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-12 and IL-2 until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) IV on days 1 and 4 for 6 weeks. Beginning on day 4 of the third week, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously 1 hour before and 20 hours after each dose of IL-12. On subsequent courses, IL-2 and IL-12 are administered on days 1 and 4 of each week. Treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease response may continue treatment until complete response or disease progression.</description>
