      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients&#xD;
      with recurrent or unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer that has been previously treated&#xD;
      with platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced, recurrent, or&#xD;
      inoperable ovarian epithelial cancer treated with aminocamptothecin as second-line therapy.&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the&#xD;
      topoisomerase-I levels with response in patients with accessible tumors treated with this&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (measurable vs nonmeasurable). (The&#xD;
      measurable disease stratum closed to accrual effective 08/1998.) Patients receive&#xD;
      aminocamptothecin IV continuously on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR)&#xD;
      receive 4 additional courses past CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every&#xD;
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study&#xD;
      within approximately 15 months. (The measurable disease stratum closed to accrual effective&#xD;
      08/1998.)&#xD;
