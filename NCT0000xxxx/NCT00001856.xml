  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On a yearly basis there are approximately 12,000 kidney transplants in the United States.&#xD;
      Presently there are approximately 40,000 patients awaiting a transplant with only 5,000&#xD;
      available donors. Due to the obvious difference between organ supply and demand, live donors&#xD;
      have become a standard source of kidneys for transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has proven that kidneys from living donors are superior to cadaveric donors (kidneys&#xD;
      harvested from a deceased individual). Kidneys from living donors are not exposed to&#xD;
      extremely low temperature that could increase post-operative problems. They are less likely&#xD;
      to experience rejection and there is a decreased likelihood that a patient will have to&#xD;
      undergo post-operative dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to promote the enrollment of healthy individuals to serve as&#xD;
      kidney donors for patients undergoing research kidney transplantation at the NIH. Potential&#xD;
      donors will be screened to make sure they are able to survive with a single kidney without&#xD;
      significant medical risk. Additional tests will be taken to establish compatibility with the&#xD;
      recipient. Compatible donors will be evaluated to determine which kidney is suitable for&#xD;
      transplantation. Both the donation and transplantation procedure will be conducted on the&#xD;
      same day. Appropriate post-operative care and follow-up will be provided at the Clinical&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed to facilitate the enrollment of healthy individuals to serve as&#xD;
      renal allograft donors for subjects undergoing protocol renal transplantation at the NIH.&#xD;
      Donation will be allowed for altruistic purposes only.&#xD;
