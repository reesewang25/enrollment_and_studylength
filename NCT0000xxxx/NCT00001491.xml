  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry's disease a genetic disorder (X-linked recessive) due to the absence of the enzyme&#xD;
      ceramidetrihexosidase. The disease is characterized by abnormal collections of glycolipids in&#xD;
      cells (histiocytes) within blood vessel walls, tumors on the thighs, buttocks, and genitalia,&#xD;
      decreased sweating, tingling sensations in the extremities, and cataracts. Patients with&#xD;
      Fabry 's disease die from complications of the kidney, heart, or brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to measure levels of a protein marker (PGP 9.5) in the skin,&#xD;
      blood, and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord (CSF) in patients with Fabry's&#xD;
      disease. In addition the study will attempt to determine if levels of the protein are&#xD;
      directly related to the severity of disease in the nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGP 9.5 protein levels will be measured in normal volunteers and patients with other diseases&#xD;
      of the nervous system then compared to the levels recorded in patients with Fabry's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is designed to improve the understanding of Fabry's disease. Patients&#xD;
      participating in it will not directly benefit from it. However, knowledge gained as a result&#xD;
      of this study may contribute to the development of effective therapies for Fabry's disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of Fabry disease in&#xD;
      the different organ systems, understand its pathogenesis, and develop adequate clinical&#xD;
      outcome measures for therapy trials. Development of sensitive outcome measures is a&#xD;
      prerequisite of enzyme or gene replacement trials in patients with Fabry's disease. STUDY&#xD;
      POPULATION: Patients with Fabry disease of all ages. The patients are not foregoing available&#xD;
      treatment to participate in this protocol. Experimental treatment is not part of this study.&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Patients will typically be seen once a year at NIH. Patients will have&#xD;
      comprehensive testing in order to evaluate the state of their health as affected by the Fabry&#xD;
      disease. OUTCOME MEASURES: All potential clinically relevant areas will be evaluated&#xD;
      comprehensively with a particular emphasis on the vasculopathy and the peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      of Fabry disease.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients with Fabry's disease will be considered as potential candidates for this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All candidates must be serologically nonreactive for human immunodeficiency (AIDS) virus.&#xD;
        HIV positive patients will be excluded because of the effects of the latter illness on the&#xD;
        nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Fabry's disease will be excluded from participation if they have additional&#xD;
        illnesses such as cancer, diabetes or vasculitis that could potentially involve the nervous&#xD;
        system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The general health and well being of each candidate must be sufficient to allow for a&#xD;
        modest amount of blood drawing, collection of appropriate laboratory specimens and&#xD;
        performance of necessary roentgenograpic and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies. In&#xD;
        addition, each candidate must be able to return to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#xD;
        annually for monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters.&#xD;
