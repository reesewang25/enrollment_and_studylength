  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of ampligen at several doses in HIV-infected patients who have not&#xD;
      yet developed AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex (ARC). Biologic, antiviral, and&#xD;
      immunologic effects will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence indicates that a long period with no symptoms follows infection with HIV.&#xD;
      Individuals who are infected with the virus could benefit from therapy with a drug that acts&#xD;
      to kill the virus or to stimulate the immune system of the individual or both. The immune&#xD;
      system is the means the human body has for fighting infections. Ampligen is a suitable drug&#xD;
      for clinical trials against HIV because it has been shown to stimulate the immune system and&#xD;
      to inhibit HIV in vitro (test tube) at drug levels that can be achieved without noticeable&#xD;
      clinical side effects.&#xD;

      Individuals who are infected with the virus could benefit from therapy with a drug that acts&#xD;
      to kill the virus or to stimulate the immune system of the individual or both. The immune&#xD;
      system is the means the human body has for fighting infections. Ampligen is a suitable drug&#xD;

      to inhibit HIV in vitro (test tube) at drug levels that can be achieved without noticeable&#xD;
      clinical side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals entered in the study are given ampligen by intravenous infusion once during the&#xD;
      first week of the trial and twice a week during the following 8 weeks. The dose each&#xD;
      individual receives is determined by the responses of earlier individuals. Each is followed&#xD;
      for 12 weeks after the last dose of ampligen is given. Each individual maintains a daily&#xD;
      diary listing any symptoms or problems that occur, such as headache, nausea, or change in&#xD;
      appetite. Other anti-HIV drugs cannot be taken during the trial, and aspirin or acetaminophen&#xD;
      should not be taken for more than 2 hours without consulting the research staff. Blood is&#xD;
      drawn at intervals during the trial and follow-up and used to determine the effect of&#xD;
      ampligen on the HIV and the immune system as well as to monitor any toxicity and side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
