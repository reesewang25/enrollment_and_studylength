      The Veterans Administration Patient Study examined the progression of peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease (PAD) in patients with large vessel PAD or isolated small vessel PAD. The Community&#xD;
      Follow-up Study following subjects with and without PAD from a previous cohort to determine&#xD;
      subsequent coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral arterial disease is a common condition, particularly in the elderly, but is the&#xD;
      least frequently studied and the least well understood of the major atherosclerotic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veterans Administration Patient Study: The progression of PAD was followed in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed at the San Diego VA Medical Center from July 1984 to June 1989. Four non-invasive&#xD;
      tests used in the initial diagnosis were repeated after a five year interval. The tests&#xD;
      included segmental blood pressure flow velocity by Doppler ultrasound, post-occlusive&#xD;
      reactive hyperemia, and pulse reappearance time. Risk factors examined for related to PAD&#xD;
      included cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure,&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose, diabetes history, immunoglobulin E, and creatinine. The degree of&#xD;
      concordance between PAD and carotid disease was evaluated using phonoangiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Follow-up Study: The study was conducted in a cohort first examined for PAD in&#xD;
      1978-1981 and followed for morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
