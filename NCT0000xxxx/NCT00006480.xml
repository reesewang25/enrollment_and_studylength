      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop&#xD;
      cancer cell from growing. Inserting genetic material made in the laboratory into a person's&#xD;
      blood cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy and gene therapy in&#xD;
      treating children who have recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of cellular immunotherapy using ex vivo&#xD;
      expanded autologous CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clones genetically modified to express the&#xD;
      CE7R scFvFc:zeta chimeric immunoreceptor and the HyTK selection/suicide gene in children with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory disseminated neuroblastoma. II. Determine the antitumor activity of&#xD;
      this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of&#xD;
      adoptively transferred clones and the effect of interleukin-2 on maintaining the in vivo&#xD;
      persistence of these clones. IV. Screen for the development of host anti-scFvFc:zeta and HyTK&#xD;
      immune responses in patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      ganciclovir in ablating transferred clones in vivo if toxicity occurs in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell&#xD;
      harvest. CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones are isolated, genetically modified to&#xD;
      express the CE7R scFvFc:zeta chimeric immunoreceptor and the HyTK selection/suicide gene, and&#xD;
      then expanded ex vivo. While the modified CTL clones are being generated, patients each&#xD;
      receive an individualized salvage chemotherapy regimen that may consist of one of the&#xD;
      following: cyclophosphamide and topotecan; ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide; or another&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen chosen by the patient's primary oncologist. The first cohort of 5&#xD;
      patients receives escalating doses of modified CTL clones IV over 30 minutes on days 0, 14,&#xD;
      and 28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Each patient begins&#xD;
      the series of 3 infusions as soon as an adequate number of modified CTL clones are ready and&#xD;
      after the acute side effects of chemotherapy have resolved. In the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity in the first cohort, the second cohort of 5 patients receives the same treatment as&#xD;
      cohort 1 plus interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12 hours on days 15-24 and 29-38. Patients&#xD;
      with unacceptable toxicity receive ganciclovir IV every 12 hours for 14 days (or longer if&#xD;
      symptomatic resolution is not achieved in that interval). Patients are followed at day 100&#xD;
      and then periodically thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.&#xD;
