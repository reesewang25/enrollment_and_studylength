  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract and AMD are two of the most important causes of visual impairment in older&#xD;
      Americans. Approximately 3.3 million people have visual impairment due to cataract. Cataract&#xD;
      extraction, although one of the safest and most successful of all operations, is now the most&#xD;
      frequently performed operation in the United States among persons older than 60, costing an&#xD;
      estimated $1.5 billion annually. AMD is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in&#xD;
      persons aged 65 and older. Approximately 25 percent of persons aged 65 years and older have&#xD;
      signs of AMD. The pathogenesis of AMD, however, is only partly understood, and its etiology&#xD;
      remains obscure. For most patients, there is no available treatment. The public health burden&#xD;
      imposed by cataract and AMD will only increase in the coming decades as the U.S. population&#xD;
      ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials will test the hypotheses that&#xD;
      supplementation with antioxidant vitamins and with low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of&#xD;
      age-related cataract and AMD. The study populations are the Women's Health Study (WHS) and&#xD;
      the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study (WACS). The WHS is a randomized, double-masked,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial design to test low-dose aspirin (100 mg on&#xD;
      alternate days) and vitamin E (600 IU on alternate days) in the primary prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. It is being conducted among 39,876 apparently&#xD;
      healthy female health professionals age 45 years and older. The WACS is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-masked, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial using a 2x2x2x2 factorial design&#xD;
      to test antioxidant vitamins (vitamins E [600 IU on alternate days] and C [500 mg daily],&#xD;
      beta carotene [50 mg on alternate days]), and a combination of folate (800 mg daily), vitamin&#xD;
      B6 (25 mg daily), and vitamin B12 (1 mg daily) among women who are at high risk for CVD&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. It is being conducted among 8,171 female health professionals, ages&#xD;
      40 years or older, who either have preexisting CVD or have at least three coronary risk&#xD;
      factors and therefore are at high risk for the development of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the randomized comparisons, the investigators will also examine risk factors&#xD;
      for age-related cataract and AMD in these two populations. Factors to be examined include&#xD;
      cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      height, body mass index, diabetes, and dietary factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study population, followup questionnaires were sent at 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      randomization and every 12 months thereafter requesting information about development of&#xD;
      relevant study end points including cataract and AMD and participant compliance with study&#xD;
      medications. Reported diagnoses of cataract and AMD are confirmed by medical record review.&#xD;
      The primary analysis for the randomized studies will be incidence of AMD or cataract in the&#xD;
      treatment and placebo groups. Survival analysis will be used to determine whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in time to AMD or cataract diagnosis.&#xD;

        Women's Health Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant must have met all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (a) female; (b) aged 45 years or older; (c) postmenopausal or with no intention of becoming&#xD;
        pregnant; (d) no reported personal history of cardiovascular disease, cancer (other than&#xD;
        non-melanoma skin cancer), gout, peptic ulcer, chronic renal or liver disease, or other&#xD;
        serious illness precluding participation; (e) no reported history of serious side effects&#xD;
        to the study treatments; (f) not currently taking aspirin, aspirin containing medication,&#xD;
        or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) more than 1 day per week or, if so doing,&#xD;
        willing to forego use of these medications; (g) not currently taking individual supplements&#xD;
        of vitamin E or beta carotene more than 1 day per week; (h) not currently taking&#xD;
        anticoagulants or corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study:&#xD;
