      To evaluate the hypothesis that chronic anxiety and/or anxiety disorders resulted in&#xD;
      hyperkinetic cardiovascular autonomic regulation, often associated with increased coronary&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective epidemiologic data indicate a strong relationship of chronic anxiety and/or&#xD;
      anxiety disorders to risk of sudden cardiac death. Other studies have shown that cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic mechanisms are altered among stably anxious individuals in the direction of reduced&#xD;
      parasympathetic and elevated sympathetic control. The latter investigations, however, have&#xD;
      been based on very small clinic samples and have been incomplete in their assessment of&#xD;
      cardiovascular regulation in anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation was the first large-scale population-based research examining the&#xD;
      cardiovascular physiology of anxiety, and helped to increase understanding of the reported&#xD;
      association between anxiety and sudden cardiac death. This study also helped to identify&#xD;
      groups in the general population at increased risk of sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used an ongoing well-characterized cohort, the VA Normative Aging Study (NAS), to&#xD;
      recruit middle-aged and older community-dwelling men and women into the study. Using a&#xD;
      variety of validated psychological and psychiatric screening instruments--including the Brief&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, the Spielberger&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Crown-Crisp Index--the study population was&#xD;
      characterized in terms of symptoms of anxiety and diagnosis of anxiety disorders.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular autonomic control was then assessed among anxious and non-anxious individuals&#xD;
      using non-invasive time-domain and power-spectral measures of heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
      variability. Cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and end-tidal pCO2 were&#xD;
      simultaneously assessed.&#xD;
