  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give ALVAC-HIV vCP205, a possible HIV&#xD;
      vaccine, and to study the immune responses in adult HIV-1 uninfected volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uganda has been severely affected by HIV infection and AIDS and has been selected to&#xD;
      participate in HIV-vaccine development. The HIV viruses commonly isolated from Uganda are 2&#xD;
      kinds that are not used in making current vaccines. Current vaccines generate several kinds&#xD;
      of immune responses. Researchers would like to see if a response to the kind of virus in a&#xD;
      current vaccine will also protect people from the viruses commonly found in Uganda.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The African country of Uganda is severely affected by HIV infection and AIDS and has been&#xD;
      selected by the World Health Organization to participate in HIV-vaccine development. The&#xD;
      predominant HIV-1 strains isolated from Ugandans are members of clade A and clade D. The only&#xD;
      vaccines available for human testing are based on envelope proteins from clade B and clade E&#xD;
      viruses. ALVAC-HIV vCP205 is a second generation vaccine that can induce a humoral and&#xD;
      cellular response against several antigens. The current study will attempt to extend these&#xD;
      findings to determine if the vCP205 vaccine, when administered to Ugandans, can induce&#xD;
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses that are reactive against the HIV strains prevalent in&#xD;
      Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are randomized into 1 of 3 groups and receive either the candidate HIV-1 vaccine&#xD;
      ALVAC-HIV vCP205, the experimental canarypox rabies vaccine ALVAC-RG, or placebo-ALVAC.&#xD;
      Neither the volunteer nor his/her health care professional knows which preparation is being&#xD;
      given. Volunteers receive 4 injections over a period of 6 months and are followed for up to&#xD;
      24 months. Clinical observations and monitoring of hematological, chemical, and immunologic&#xD;
      parameters are done. Safety is evaluated by monitoring for local and systemic adverse&#xD;
      reactions during the course of the trial. Comparative immunogenicity analyses are based on&#xD;
      CTL responses to HIV and measures of binding and HIV-specific antibody responses. At each&#xD;
      visit, volunteers are counseled on how to avoid HIV exposure and pregnancy.&#xD;
