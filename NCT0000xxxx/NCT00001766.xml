      This study examined the interactions of various drugs used to treat HIV infection in order to&#xD;
      design larger studies of possible combinations for people who continue to have high viral&#xD;
      levels despite combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who have a viral load of at least 500&#xD;
      copies/mL; who have received 20 weeks of protease inhibitor therapy, with the same protease&#xD;
      inhibitors in combination therapy for the last 12 weeks; and who have never been treated with&#xD;
      abacavir, amprenavir or efavirenz were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive 600 milligrams a day of efavirenz (a non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor); 300 mg twice daily of abacavir (a nucleoside analog); and 1200 mg&#xD;
      twice a day of amprenavir (a protease inhibitor). In addition to these drugs, six patients&#xD;
      will receive 500 mg twice a day of ritonavir (a protease inhibitor); six patients will&#xD;
      receive 200 mg twice a day of ritonavir; and 10 will receive 1250 mg twice a day of&#xD;
      nelfinavir (a protease inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the two ritonavir groups (500-mg and 200-mg dose groups) took abacavir and&#xD;
      amprenavir for one week and then come to the clinic for blood tests to measure drug levels&#xD;
      before taking their morning pills and at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after taking the&#xD;
      medicines. They will then add ritonavir to their treatment regimen. After one week, they will&#xD;
      return for blood tests as before. They will then add efavirenz to their regimen and had&#xD;
      bloods drawn again after another 1 or 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the nelfinavir group took abacavir, amprenavir and nelfinavir for one week and&#xD;
      then have blood sampling as described above for the ritonavir group. They will then add&#xD;
      efavirenz to the regimen and repeat the blood tests again after another 1 or 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are being seen in the clinic for follow-up only if they wish to continue to&#xD;
      participate and if the regimen appears to offer clinical benefit.&#xD;

      In this study of pharmacokinetic interactions, (1) the effect of ritonavir on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of amprenavir; (2) the effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      amprenavir and ritonavir, and (3) the effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      amprenavir and nelfinavir were examined. Twenty-two patients who have a viral burden of at&#xD;
      least 500 copies/mL on combination therapy with a protease inhibitor for at least 20 weeks&#xD;
      were to be enrolled to receive open-label treatment, 6 with abacavir 300 mg po BID,&#xD;
      amprenavir 1200 mg po BID, ritonavir 200 mg po BID and efavirenz 600 mg po QD, 6 with&#xD;
      abacavir 300 mg po BID, amprenavir 1200 mg po BID, ritonavir 500 mg po BID and efavirenz 600&#xD;
      mg po QD, and 10 with abacavir 300 mg po BID, amprenavir 1200 mg po BID, nelfinavir 1250 mg&#xD;
      po BID and efavirenz 600 mg po QD. The groups enrolled sequentially: low-dose ritonavir&#xD;
      combination group, then the full dose ritonavir combination group, and then the nelfinavir&#xD;
      combination group. Subjects were seen at pre-entry, baseline (Day 1), and thereafter at study&#xD;
      weeks 1 (serial sampling), 2 (serial sampling), 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 then every 8 weeks through&#xD;
      one year. Patients discontinued current therapy and without a washout period began dosing.&#xD;
      For the groups who will receive ritonavir, the schedule was: dose with abacavir and&#xD;
      amprenavir and, after one-week, serial plasma sampling was performed for baseline amprenavir&#xD;
      levels. Next ritonavir at the assigned dose was added (for the full-dose, there is a rapid&#xD;
      dose escalation) and plasma sampling was repeated one week later; finally, efavirenz 600 mg&#xD;
      once daily will be added and plasma sampling was again be repeated between 2 weeks after&#xD;
      beginning the combination. For the nelfinavir group, the schedule was: dose with nelfinavir,&#xD;
      amprenavir, and abacavir for one week and obtain serial plasma sampling, then add efavirenz&#xD;
      for another week and obtain serial plasma sampling. Patients with a confirmed increase in&#xD;
      viral burden of one log or greater from baseline will end study participation. The safety and&#xD;
      antiviral activity of each combination were also assessed and continue to be assessed;&#xD;
      toxicity management is outlined in the protocol. This study remains open in order to continue&#xD;
      to provide these drugs to subjects who completed the original one-year study period and who&#xD;
      wish to continue medications that appear, by viral load, to be of benefit to them.&#xD;
