      AMENDED: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered AZT to HIV-1 infected&#xD;
      pregnant women in labor; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of AZT and&#xD;
      its metabolites in newborns of HIV-1 infected mothers who receive IV AZT only during labor;&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety of IV AZT administered by continuous infusion to HIV-1 infected&#xD;
      laboring women and their infants. Original design: To determine the distribution and&#xD;
      elimination of zidovudine (AZT) in the body as well as its safety in the treatment of&#xD;
      pregnant women and their unborn children. The information derived from this study is required&#xD;
      in order to design a future study that will assess the efficacy of AZT in reducing the&#xD;
      transmission rate of HIV-1 from seropositive women to their fetus by treating them during the&#xD;
      third trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 30 percent to 40 percent infected pregnant women risk transmission of HIV-1 to&#xD;
      their infants, whether they be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Zidovudine (AZT) has previously&#xD;
      demonstrated its effectiveness as a potent inhibitor of HIV replication in vitro and in adult&#xD;
      patients; benefits of treatment include decreased mortality rate, decreased incidence of&#xD;
      opportunistic infections, and increased number of CD4 cells. Phase I AZT studies in children,&#xD;
      however, have resulted in uncontrolled information regarding clinical efficacy. The present&#xD;
      study, therefore, will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) and&#xD;
      oral AZT administration to HIV-1 infected pregnant women in the 3rd trimester, as well as the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of such treatment in their newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the results will be instrumental in designing future studies to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of AZT in reducing the transmission risk of HIV-1.&#xD;

      An estimated 30 percent to 40 percent infected pregnant women risk transmission of HIV-1 to&#xD;
      their infants, whether they be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Zidovudine (AZT) has previously&#xD;
      demonstrated its effectiveness as a potent inhibitor of HIV replication in vitro and in adult&#xD;
      patients; benefits of treatment include decreased mortality rate, decreased incidence of&#xD;
      opportunistic infections, and increased number of CD4 cells. Phase I AZT studies in children,&#xD;
      however, have resulted in uncontrolled information regarding clinical efficacy. The present&#xD;
      study, therefore, will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) and&#xD;
      oral AZT administration to HIV-1 infected pregnant women in the 3rd trimester, as well as the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of such treatment in their newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the results will be instrumental in designing future studies to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of AZT in reducing the transmission risk of HIV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: For the pharmacokinetic and safety study of AZT during labor and in the newborn&#xD;
      infants, women who were screened and have consented are included in this part of the study. 6&#xD;
      mother-infant pairs without a history of intravenous drug abuse and 4 pairs with such a&#xD;
      history are evaluated. The mother receives an infusion of AZT over 1 hour followed by&#xD;
      continuous infusion of AZT for at least 4 hours until delivery. Pharmacokinetic data is&#xD;
      collected on all patients including those who deliver before receiving 4 hours of AZT&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: The trial will proceed as described above except that the first 2 methadone patients&#xD;
      enrolled will receive half the AZT dose given to the non-methadone patients. Results will be&#xD;
      evaluated before dosing of additional methadone-use patients is done. Original design:&#xD;
      Following evaluation, patients receive one intravenous dose of AZT over a 1-hour period. One&#xD;
      day later, patients begin taking AZT capsules 5 times a day by mouth for the remaining weeks&#xD;
      prior to labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During labor, patients continue to receive AZT intravenously every 4 hours until they deliver&#xD;
      their babies. Blood and urine tests are made to measure the amounts of AZT in the mother's&#xD;
      and, after delivery, the baby's body fluids. AZT is stopped after the baby has been&#xD;
      delivered. The initial enrollment is six women with no history of intravenous drug abuse plus&#xD;
      another four women with a history of intravenous drug use, who have been receiving methadone&#xD;
      maintenance therapy. These women are not required to have a negative urine toxicology screen&#xD;
      for illicit drugs to enter the study.&#xD;
