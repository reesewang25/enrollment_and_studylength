      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients&#xD;
      who have metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and feasibility of prostate specific antigen (PSA) RNA&#xD;
      pulsed autologous dendritic cells in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. II. Evaluate&#xD;
      the presence and magnitude of cellular immune responses against PSA as a surrogate target for&#xD;
      immune activation in this patient population. III. Assess the presence, frequency, and&#xD;
      activation status of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocytes prior to and following immunotherapy&#xD;
      with this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate humoral immune responses as evidenced on&#xD;
      circulating peripheral PSA specific antibodies in this patient population. V. Evaluate&#xD;
      delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to irradiated PSA RNA transfected dendritic cells and&#xD;
      other standard recall antigens prior to and following immunotherapy in these patients. VI.&#xD;
      Evaluate eventual clinical responses as evidenced on clinical and biochemical (PSA) response&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive prostate specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      RNA pulsed autologous dendritic cells IV over 2 minutes followed by PSA RNA dendritic cells&#xD;
      intradermally on weeks 0, 2, and 4 for a total of 3 treatments. Cohorts of 3-6 patients&#xD;
      receive escalating doses of PSA RNA pulsed autologous dendritic cells until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 3 months,&#xD;
      then every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.&#xD;
