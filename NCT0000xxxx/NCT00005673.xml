      This 2-part study will test the safety and anti-HIV activity of capravirine alone, and the&#xD;
      safety, anti-HIV activity, and drug interactions of capravirine combined with other anti-HIV&#xD;
      drugs. Capravirine belongs to a class of drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors (NNRTIs), which are effective when used together with other drugs, including&#xD;
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may enroll in Part 1 of the study. HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients 18 years of age and older who have not previously been treated with a NNRTI&#xD;
      (efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine) may participate in Part 2. All prospective study&#xD;
      participants will be screened for eligibility with a physical examination, blood tests, a&#xD;
      urine test and an electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive capravirine alone for 7 days and capravirine plus efavirenz (another&#xD;
      NNRTI) for an additional 10 days. On day 1, participants will have a physical examination,&#xD;
      urine test and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples will be collected just before the first&#xD;
      dose of capravirine is given and again at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the dose. A&#xD;
      small plastic tube will be placed in a vein to avoid multiple needle sticks. On day 8,&#xD;
      participants will have another physical examination and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be drawn again as described above. In the evening of day 8, efavirenz will be added to&#xD;
      the regimen. On day 18 (the last day of the study), participants will have another physical&#xD;
      examination and blood tests. Blood will again be collected as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will take capravirine alone for 8) days and capravirine plus ritonavir (a protease&#xD;
      inhibitor) for an additional 8 days. Physical examinations, urine tests, and blood&#xD;
      collections will be done as described above on day 1, day 8 and day 16 (the last day) of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - Patients will take capravirine alone for 7 days. On day 1, patients will have a&#xD;
      physical examination, urine test and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      just before the first dose of capravirine is given and again at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12&#xD;
      hours after the dose. A small plastic tube will be placed in a vein to avoid multiple needle&#xD;
      sticks. On day 8, patients will have another physical examination and laboratory blood tests.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn again as described above. Additional drugs will then be added to&#xD;
      the regimen (in varying doses according to group), as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - efavirenz plus abacavir&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - ritonavir plus efavirenz plus abacavir&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - ritonavir plus efavirenz plus abacavir&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 15, the procedures performed on day 8 will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have the option of having blood drawn daily on days 2 through 7 to measure&#xD;
      HIV-1 viral load and of having a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) done between days 2 and 7 to&#xD;
      measure how well capravirine gets into the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After day 15, patients in all groups will continue with their drug regimen until week 48 or&#xD;
      until it is determined that the treatment is not effective for the patient. Physical&#xD;
      examinations, viral load measurements, white blood cell counts and other blood tests will be&#xD;
      done periodically throughout the trial. Within 4 weeks after the end of the study, patients&#xD;
      will be followed with another physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an ECG.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, phase I study examining the safety and anti-HIV activity of an&#xD;
      investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, capravirine. The primary&#xD;
      objectives of the study are 1) To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of capravirine&#xD;
      when combined with efavirenz and (low-dose) ritonavir in non-HIV-infected volunteers; 2) To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, virologic activity, and pharmacokinetics of capravirine when combined&#xD;
      with efavirenz, (low-dose) ritonavir, and abacavir in HIV-infected patients; and 3) To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, virologic activity, and pharmacokinetics of a once-daily regimen with&#xD;
      capravirine, efavirenz, (low-dose) ritonavir, and abacavir in HIV-infected patients. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part I will examine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      potential drug interactions of capravirine with other antiretroviral agents in&#xD;
      non-HIV-infected volunteers. Sixteen volunteers (8 per group) will receive capravirine&#xD;
      monotherapy (7 days), followed by the addition of either: 1) efavirenz (10 days); or 2)&#xD;
      ritonavir (8 days). Part II will examine the safety, virologic activity, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and potential drug interactions of capravirine in HIV-infected patients. Thirty patients (10&#xD;
      per group) will receive of capravirine monotherapy (7 days), followed by the randomized&#xD;
      addition of: 1) efavirenz/abacavir (7 days); 2) ritonavir/efavirenz/abacavir (7 days)&#xD;
      twice-daily regimen; or 3) ritonavir/efavirenz/abacavir (7 days) once-daily regimen. [Doses&#xD;
      of capravirine may be changed depending upon pharmacokinetic data obtained from Part I of the&#xD;
      study.] The primary efficacy endpoint is the time-to-virologic-failure.&#xD;
