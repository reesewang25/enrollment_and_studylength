      To investigate the differences in diet, fat cell morphology and lipoprotein metabolism in&#xD;
      previously- overweight and naturally lean men and women who ran and who lived sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyles in order to better understand the relationship between lipoprotein metabolism and&#xD;
      weight set-point.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations of long distance&#xD;
      runners has been ascribed almost exclusively to increased muscle lipoprotein lipase. Based on&#xD;
      data collected in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, the investigators proposed an&#xD;
      alternative theory: long-distance runners had the HDL-cholesterol metabolism of men who were&#xD;
      below their sedentary weight rather than the HDL-cholesterol metabolism of lean sedentary men&#xD;
      who were at their usual sedentary weight. In other analyses, they found that the most&#xD;
      significant determinant of male runners' plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations was the&#xD;
      difference between the runners' greatest weight and their current weight. HDL- cholesterol&#xD;
      levels were highest in runners who had lost the most weight, i.e., highest in those who were&#xD;
      presumed to be the furthest below their weight set-point&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a result of a Program Announcement (PA) released in October, 1994 on Physical&#xD;
      Activity and Cardiopulmonary Health. The PA was jointly sponsored by the NHLBI, the National&#xD;
      Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the National Institute of&#xD;
      Nursing Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional study, runners and sedentary men and women were measured for&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of HDL and&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein subclasses, apolipoproteins A-I and B, intravenous fat clearance&#xD;
      rate, post-heparin lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase, adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase,&#xD;
      cholesteryl ester transfer activity, diet, percent body fat, and regional adiposity. It was&#xD;
      hoped that the survey would confirm or reject the weight set-point hypothesis, provide a&#xD;
      possible explanation of the lipoprotein differences between male and female runners, and&#xD;
      elucidate the mechanism for the lipoprotein changes that occur during exercise-induced weight&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
