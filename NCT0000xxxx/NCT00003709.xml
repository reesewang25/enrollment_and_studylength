      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of carbendazim in treating patients who&#xD;
      have advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral carbendazim in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of oral&#xD;
      carbendazim in these patients. III. Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of oral&#xD;
      carbendazim in these patients. IV. Assess the recommended dose of oral carbendazim to be used&#xD;
      in phase II studies. V. Determine preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this regimen&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral carbendazim weekly for 3&#xD;
      weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Treatment is repeated every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating&#xD;
      doses of carbendazim. If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is seen in 1 of 3 patients treated at a&#xD;
      given dose level, 3 additional patients will be entered at the same dose level. Dose&#xD;
      escalation continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined&#xD;
      as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience DLT. Patients are followed for&#xD;
      up to 30 days posttreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 35 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
