      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures may improve the ability to detect metastatic melanoma and to&#xD;
      determine the extent of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to evaluate the effectiveness of PET and CT scans to detect&#xD;
      metastatic disease in patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of fludeoxyglucose F 18&#xD;
      (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in detecting metastatic disease in patients&#xD;
      with stage III or IV melanoma considered for operative management based on the currently&#xD;
      accepted diagnostic work up including CT imaging. II. Determine how often the clinical&#xD;
      management of these patients is altered based on FDG PET imaging findings in addition to CT&#xD;
      scan results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are required to fast for a minimum of 6 hours prior to positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) is administered IV over 15 minutes&#xD;
      followed 50-60 minutes later by whole body PET imaging. Iodinated contrast dye is&#xD;
      administered by IV injection and by mouth followed by CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and&#xD;
      pelvis within 2 weeks of PET imaging. Whole body FDG PET imaging and CT imaging of the chest,&#xD;
      abdomen, and pelvis are repeated at 6 months. Initial positive PET or CT imaging results are&#xD;
      verified based on surgical and/or biopsy findings or clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.&#xD;
