    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on the different ways people control limb and body&#xD;
      movements. This information will be used to develop a database on normal movements and&#xD;
      adaptive movements of people who have diseases that affect the way they move. The database&#xD;
      will serve as a tool to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with movement-related&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers of all ages who have normal movement patterns or who have developed different ways&#xD;
      to perform movement tasks may be eligible for this study. A physician or physical therapist&#xD;
      will screen candidates to determine their strength, flexibility and range of motion of&#xD;
      joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to perform movements such as walking, walking up or down stairs,&#xD;
      standing quietly or reaching for an object or using treadmill. For the test, the arms and&#xD;
      legs are wrapped with a soft, rubber-like material to which small plastic reflective balls&#xD;
      are attached. A piece of firm material called a shell may be attached to the rubber sleeves&#xD;
      or other areas of the body. Then the volunteer performs the specified task several times&#xD;
      while special cameras record the movement. These cameras will record the positions of the&#xD;
      reflective balls during movement and may show the person s face or body. Electrical activity&#xD;
      in the muscles also may be measured, using small metal electrodes attached to the surface of&#xD;
      the skin with an adhesive bandage....&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to develop a database of normative and adaptive control&#xD;
      strategies for human motion. Volunteers will serve as subjects after they complete a&#xD;
      neuromusculoskeletal screening exam. Subjects will be asked to perform one or more tasks&#xD;
      related to the execution of activities of daily living such as: walking on the ground,&#xD;
      walking on a treadmill, quiet and perturbed standing, stair ascent and descent, turning and&#xD;
      jumping, cycling, elliptical training, and isolated upper and lower extremity limb movements&#xD;
      or trunk movements. The subjects movement patterns will be recorded using a three-dimensional&#xD;
      motion tracking system. Motion data will be analyzed using a rigid body six degree-of-freedom&#xD;
      approach when applicable. Temporal/spatial, kinematic, kinetic, and surface electromyographic&#xD;
      variables will be collected and calculated. When only temporal-spatial parameters are of&#xD;
      interest, an instrumented portable walkway system may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors affect the ability to move. The ones we are mainly interested in investigating&#xD;
      include muscle weakness, spasticity, and dynamic balance. To quantify strength or spasticity,&#xD;
      a force transducer is needed such as a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer which is a standard&#xD;
      rehabilitation assessment and training device, or a more simple handheld dynamometer can be&#xD;
      used that the person presses against as force is recorded. For the spasticity tests, a person&#xD;
      or a machine such as the Biodex moves a joint through an arc of motion (e.g. elbow, knee, or&#xD;
      ankle) at a range of speeds from 5-240 degrees per second while resistance to motion is being&#xD;
      recorded or graded subjectively. EMG and joint position may be collected simultaneously&#xD;
      during the passive movements. The dynamic balance tests will be performed on a force plate or&#xD;
      using a clinical balance testing device, the Equitest, by Neurcom. To determine if electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (ES) improves limb movement, walking, and balance, a FDA-cleared device (LG-8TM&#xD;
      FDA 510K 4 Channel TENS/EMS Unit, LGmedsupply.com) may be used in patients who have some gait&#xD;
      dysfunction in their lower extremities. Only persons with central nervous system injuries who&#xD;
      have an abnormal gait pattern will be given the opportunity to use this device. The device&#xD;
      delivers individually programmed ES to aid in muscle function of the hip, knee or ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient groups will be identified clinically or statistically. Group means and standard&#xD;
      deviations will then be computed. It is hoped the database developed may serve as a tool by&#xD;
      which individual patient data may be compared in order to facilitate the diagnosis and&#xD;
      optimize the treatment and clinical outcome of patients with movement related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An over ground harness system may be used for some of the over ground or instrumented gait&#xD;
      and balance assessments if there is concern that the patient is too weak or unbalanced and&#xD;
      therefore may trip or fall during the activity, or to help facilitate more normal patterns by&#xD;
      decreasing the load borne by the trunk and/or legs.&#xD;
