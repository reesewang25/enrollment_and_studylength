    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: To evaluate the short-term safety of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 vaccine versus MF59 placebo&#xD;
      administered to HIV-infected pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY: To evaluate the immunogenicity and long-term safety of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 in&#xD;
      HIV-infected pregnant women who received the vaccine during pregnancy only or during&#xD;
      pregnancy and postpartum. To evaluate immunogenicity and safety in the infant through 18&#xD;
      months of age following maternal immunization with the vaccine during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active immunization of HIV-infected women during pregnancy may slow the progression of&#xD;
      maternal disease, reduce the titer of virus in maternal plasma, and increase the titer of&#xD;
      epitope-specific antibody. Also, active immunization has the potential to induce primary&#xD;
      immunity in the fetus and to boost both T-cell and humoral immune responses to HIV in the&#xD;
      mothers.&#xD;

      Active immunization of HIV-infected women during pregnancy may slow the progression of&#xD;
      maternal disease, reduce the titer of virus in maternal plasma, and increase the titer of&#xD;

      mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are randomized to receive rgp120/HIV-1SF2 vaccine or MF59 placebo. Patients receive the&#xD;
      first immunization between 16 and 24 weeks gestation and monthly thereafter until delivery,&#xD;
      for a maximum of five immunizations. Patients may continue to receive the immunization&#xD;
      regimen to which they were originally assigned at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum. Maternal&#xD;
      follow-up continues until 18 months postpartum; infants are followed until age 18 months.&#xD;

          -  Methadone maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not initiate antiretroviral therapy for disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may change from AZT to another antiretroviral agent or may begin&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy following delivery, if clinically indicated.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Estimated gestational age between 16 and 24 weeks, confirmed by baseline sonogram that&#xD;
             does not demonstrate any congenital abnormalities considered to be incompatible with&#xD;
