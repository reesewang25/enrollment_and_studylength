  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop&#xD;
      growing or die. This phase II trial is studying how well topotecan hydrochloride works in&#xD;
      treating children with meningeal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the therapeutic activity of intrathecal topotecan, in terms of response rate and&#xD;
      time to central nervous system (CNS) progression, in pediatric patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory neoplastic meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the&#xD;
      concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs.&#xD;
      other leukemia/lymphoma vs medulloblastoma vs other solid tumors). (Recurrent CNS acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia stratum only open to accrual as of 11/30/04)&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intrathecally (IT) over 5 minutes twice&#xD;
      weekly for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning 1 week after completion of induction, patients receive topotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride IT over 5 minutes weekly for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Beginning 2 weeks after completion of consolidation, patients receive topotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride IT over 5 minutes twice monthly for 4 months and then monthly through year 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-77 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
