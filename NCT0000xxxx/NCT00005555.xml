      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the study will provide important data regarding the dose of exercise required to&#xD;
      improve cardiovascular health, as described both by the NIH Consensus Conference on Physical&#xD;
      Activity and CV Health and by the recent Report of the Surgeon General. The study was&#xD;
      initiated in response to a Program Announcement released in October 1994 on Physical Activity&#xD;
      and Cardiopulmonary Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized into one of five groups in a 2x2 factorial design plus a usual care&#xD;
      control group (n=100 in each of 5 groups). Subjects trained at a moderate (45-55 percent) or&#xD;
      high (65-75 percent of maximum heart rate reserve) intensity, and at a frequency of 3-4 or&#xD;
      5-7 days/week (viz., Group 1, 65-75 percent at 5-7 days/week; Group 2, 65-75 percent at 3-4&#xD;
      days/week; Group 3, 45-55 percent at 5-7 days/weekk; Group 4, 45-55 percent at 3-4 days/week;&#xD;
      and, Group 5, usual care control). Controls received advice from a physician to increase&#xD;
      their physical activity. The subjects in Groups 1-4 participated in an exercise intervention&#xD;
      using walking as the mode of training for a total of 24 months. A lifestyle model of physical&#xD;
      activity was used, in that subjects could accumulate exercise minutes during the day in&#xD;
      10-minute increments or more continuously (for a total duration of 30 minutes/day), and&#xD;
      training was conducted where it was most convenient for the subject (i.e. at home, work or&#xD;
      some combination thereof). Tests occurred at baseline (0), 12, and 24 months of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis was that Groups 1-4 would show a significant reduction in systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure and an increase in HDL-cholesterol compared to the usual care&#xD;
      control group. A second hypothesis was that that there would be significant main effects for&#xD;
      both frequency and intensity, with the higher levels of each producing greater improvement on&#xD;
      the major outcome variables compared to the lower levels of each dose. The study also planned&#xD;
      to determine the minimal dose response to exercise necessary to elicit significant&#xD;
      improvement in cardiovascular and behavioral health factors. Finally, the project included&#xD;
      examination of the effects of age and level of initial test values on outcome variables to&#xD;
      determine if their interactions affected the results of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also includes assessment of the effect of specific doses of exercise on the&#xD;
      reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increase in HDL-cholesterol (primary&#xD;
      outcomes), in addition to changes in levels of physical activity, aerobic fitness (VO2 max),&#xD;
      body composition (percent fat and waist-to-hip ratio), triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes). Psychological variables (depression, anxiety, anger, and perceived&#xD;
      stress) and health-related quality of life are also evaluated, and the important issue of&#xD;
      adherence to exercise is examined with respect to the effect of dose of exercise.&#xD;
