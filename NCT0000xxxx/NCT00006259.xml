      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to deliver x-rays directly to the tumor&#xD;
      and cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of stereotactic radiation therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients who have brain metastases.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery without whole brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy in elderly patients or patients with poor performance status who have brain&#xD;
      metastases. II. Determine the neurologic function in these patients after receiving this&#xD;
      treatment regimen. III. Determine the quality of life in these patients with this treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic head frame placement, followed by stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery using Gamma Knife, on day 1. Quality of life is assessed one week prior to and&#xD;
      one week after treatment, and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months. Patients are followed at&#xD;
      one week, at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months, every 4 months for one year, and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.&#xD;
