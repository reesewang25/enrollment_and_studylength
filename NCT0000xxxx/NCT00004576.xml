  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of an experimental drug called LY300164 on improving&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease symptoms, such as movement impairments and tremor, as well as involuntary&#xD;
      movements produced by long-term treatment with levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with relatively advanced (Stage II to IV) Parkinson's disease between 30 and 75&#xD;
      years of age may be eligible for this 8-week study. Participants will have a complete medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination, including blood tests and an electrocardiogram, and&#xD;
      possibly brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT scan, and chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will stop taking all anti-parkinsonism medications except levodopa (Sinemet) and the&#xD;
      experimental drug during the study. For the first 1 to 3 days, patients will be in the&#xD;
      hospital for a levodopa &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this study, levodopa is infused through&#xD;
      a vein for up to 8 hours, with symptoms monitored frequently to determine the doses that will&#xD;
      produce two results: 1) the dose that is less than what is needed to relieve symptoms, and 2)&#xD;
      the dose that relieves symptoms, but may produce dyskinesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When these dose rates are determined, patients will begin treatment in one of two groups. One&#xD;
      will take LY300164 3 times a day, along with levodopa, for 3 weeks. The second group will&#xD;
      take placebo tablets (a look-alike tablet with no active ingredient) and levodopa on the same&#xD;
      schedule as the LY300164 group. A brief medical examination and routine blood and urine tests&#xD;
      will be done weekly. The drug dose will be increased every 3 to 4 days until significant side&#xD;
      effects occur or the maximal dose is reached. Patients will be closely monitored for 4 hours&#xD;
      after every increase. At the end of the 3 weeks, or when the maximal dose is reached,&#xD;
      patients will be readmitted to the hospital for 2 to 3 days for a second levodopa&#xD;
      dose-finding study, while continuing on LY300164 or placebo. After this test, patients will&#xD;
      resume taking levodopa and the experimental drug or placebo as before for another 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 2-weeks, the entire procedure will be repeated in both groups, but the&#xD;
      treatments will be switched-that is, the patients who were taking LY300164 will now take&#xD;
      placebo, and the patients who took placebo will now take the drug. At the end of the second 3&#xD;
      weeks, the levodopa infusion procedure will be repeated once more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, parkinsonism symptoms and dyskinesias will be evaluated and blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn periodically to measure drug levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of&#xD;
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid (AMPA) receptor blockade on the&#xD;
      severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor response complications in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial,&#xD;
      efficacy will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be&#xD;
      monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Males and females between the ages of 30 and 75 are eligible for the study. All will carry&#xD;
        the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease based on the presence of a characteristic&#xD;
        clinical history and neurological findings. All will have relatively advanced disease&#xD;
        (Hoehn and Yahr Stages II to IV) with levodopa-associated motor response complications,&#xD;
        including wearing-off fluctuations and peak-dose dyskinesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject&#xD;
        the patient to unwarranted risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities including liver enzyme elevations more&#xD;
        than three times the upper limit of normal, or neutropenia (WBC less than 4000).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No parkinson's disease patients exhibiting diphasic or end-of-dose dyskinesias or disabling&#xD;
        dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since LY300164 is an inhibitor of CP4503A4, patients receiving certain drugs metabolized by&#xD;
        that pathway will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who are unable to be treated with levodopa/carbidopa alone or a single,&#xD;
        relatively short-acting dopamine agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who require additional treatment with amantadine or other concomitant&#xD;
        medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnant women or those not practicing effective means of birth control since the&#xD;
        influence of any investigational compound on the unborn child and reproductive organs is&#xD;
        unknown.&#xD;
