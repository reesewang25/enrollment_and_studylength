  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A variety of hormones and immune system processes are responsible for how the body responds&#xD;
      to illness. This study concentrates on how the hormone cortisol effects the release of immune&#xD;
      system factors called cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol is a hormone produced in the adrenal glands as a response to stimulation from the&#xD;
      pituitary gland. Abnormal levels of cortisol have been seen in several diseases such as&#xD;
      depression and multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines are factors produced by certain white blood cells. They act by changing the cells&#xD;
      that produce them (autocrine effect), altering other cells close to them (paracrine), and&#xD;
      effecting cells throughout the body (endocrine effect). Cytokines are important in&#xD;
      controlling inflammation processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers would like to determine if changes in levels of hormones in the&#xD;
      blood are associated with changes in cytokine levels. In addition, researchers would like to&#xD;
      learn more about how cytokines respond to hormones in certain diseases.&#xD;

      Many of the biochemical alterations observed in people suffering from major depression are&#xD;
      changes in the concentrations and activity of components of the generalized stress response.&#xD;
      These include the principal hypothalamic stimulus of pituitary-adrenal activation&#xD;
      (corticotropin releasing hormone) and the locus ceruleus/norepinephrine system. The current&#xD;
      study attempts to provide a clearer picture of the stability of changes during the acute&#xD;
      illness, the treatment phase and the recovery process. We particularly wish to determine&#xD;
      whether abnormalities in HPA axis perturbability in the well-state can be demonstrated, and&#xD;
      if so how these are related to the acutely-ill state, since this information could provide a&#xD;
      quantifiable phenotypic marker for depression.&#xD;
