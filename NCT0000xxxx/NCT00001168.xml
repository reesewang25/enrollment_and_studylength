  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipoproteins are particles that carry fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides through the&#xD;
      blood stream. These particles are involved in causing blood vessel disease that can lead to&#xD;
      conditions like hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) or heart attacks (myocardial&#xD;
      infarctions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to look closely at the factors affecting lipoproteins. Researchers&#xD;
      plan to study patients and normal volunteers by measuring lipoprotein levels in the blood.&#xD;
      Patients and volunteers will be placed on a balanced diet during the study. In addition,&#xD;
      researchers plan to measure levels of various hormone and enzymes in the blood. Patients and&#xD;
      volunteers participating in the study may be asked to undergo more specific tests in order to&#xD;
      collect more information about lipoprotein metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may not provide direct benefits to patients and volunteers participating in it.&#xD;
      However, information gathered from this study may help researchers develop better skills and&#xD;
      techniques to diagnose and treat patients with diseases of lipoprotein metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lipoprotein transport system is vital to the delivery of the hydrophobic fats that are&#xD;
      carried in the aqueous environment of the blood. The lipoprotein particles that comprise this&#xD;
      system are polydisperse and contain triglycerides, free and esterified cholesterol,&#xD;
      phospholipids and proteins. Inborn errors in the lipoprotein transport system lead to&#xD;
      alterations in both the steady state concentrations of the various lipoproteins and in the&#xD;
      metabolism of these particles. These inborn errors lead to both hyperlipoproteinemia and&#xD;
      hypolipoproteinemia. Profound changes in the ambient lipoprotein concentrations have a&#xD;
      variety of clinical manifestations. The present study protocol is designed to permit a full&#xD;
      evaluation of the lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins, in patients with potential&#xD;
      genetic defects in these processes. The protocol will also permit training of students, staff&#xD;
      clinicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, dieticians and post-doctoral fellows&#xD;
      in the evaluation and treatment of patients with dyslipidemias. The study population will&#xD;
      include patients which are referred to the Lipid Service from private care providers,&#xD;
      academic institutions, or the NHLBI Lipid website, with any of the following potential lipid&#xD;
      abnormalities or clinical stigmata associated with dyslipoproteinemias: a) increased plasma&#xD;
      levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol b) decreased plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol c) postprandial hyperlipidemia or d)&#xD;
      eruptive xanthomas, xanthelasma, tuberous or tendinous xanthomas, or corneal opacities.&#xD;
