      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining topotecan and paclitaxel in&#xD;
      treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer or other advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: Phase I: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral topotecan combined&#xD;
      with a fixed dose of paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) and&#xD;
      other advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the response rate of NSCLC patients treated at the&#xD;
      MTD of oral topotecan combined with intravenous paclitaxel. III. Determine the dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities of this drug combination in this patient population. Phase II: IV. Determine the&#xD;
      toxicities of this regimen at its MTD in patients with NSCLC. V. Determine time to response,&#xD;
      response duration, survival, time to progression, and rate of stable disease of patients with&#xD;
      NSCLC treated with this regimen at the MTD. VI. Assess changes in well-being of patients with&#xD;
      NSCLC treated with this regimen at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients receive oral topotecan on&#xD;
      days 1-5 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD&#xD;
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer are accrued to receive treatment with topotecan and paclitaxel at the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose. Quality of life is assessed in the phase II portion of the study at baseline,&#xD;
      before each treatment course, and at the end of the study. Patients are followed at 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for the phase I dose escalation&#xD;
      portion of this study. A total of 14-40 additional non-small cell lung cancer patients will&#xD;
      be accrued to the phase II portion of this study.&#xD;
