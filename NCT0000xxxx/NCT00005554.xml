      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures are increasingly used in the treatment of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, with approximately 300,000 interventions performed each year.&#xD;
      Despite new developments in cardiology such as intra-coronary stents and anticoagulant&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments, a major problem remains the frequent occurrence of coronary&#xD;
      restenosis and new cardiac events within six months after the intervention. These adverse&#xD;
      outcomes occur in one out of four patients and have substantial impact on the costs of&#xD;
      medical care and patients' quality of life. Research indicated that hemostatic factors (e.g.,&#xD;
      fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor) promote the formation&#xD;
      of blood clots and that these factors predict coronary restenosis. Moreover, prior&#xD;
      longitudinal studies have also demonstrated that the psychosocial traits of hostility and&#xD;
      depression affect clinical progression of coronary disease. These psychosocial factors&#xD;
      significantly predict adverse long-term outcome after revascularization and both hostility&#xD;
      and depression are known to affect blood clotting factors. In addition, acute mental and&#xD;
      physical stress are reported to affect blood clotting factors (coagulation and fibrinolysis)&#xD;
      and responses to stress are reported to be more pronounced in hostile individuals. However,&#xD;
      previous research on predictors of adverse clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      revascularization has not examined stress-induced changes in hemostatic factors and the&#xD;
      consequences of these responses for progression of coronary artery disease. Therefore, the&#xD;
      study investigates whether psychosocial factors and responses to acute mental stress affect&#xD;
      measures of the blood clotting process that are involved in progression of coronary disease,&#xD;
      thereby increasing the risk of an adverse prognosis following percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      revascularization. This study may improve the identification of patients at risk for&#xD;
      recurrent cardiac events and provide further understanding of the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the progression of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigated whether psychosocial factors and responses to acute mental stress&#xD;
      affected measures of the blood clotting process that are involved in progression of coronary&#xD;
      disease, thereby increasing the risk of an adverse prognosis following percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      revascularization. This study helped to improve the identification of patients at risk for&#xD;
      recurrent cardiac events and provided further understanding of the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the progression of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
