      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1987 idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was a disorder of unknown cause that directly&#xD;
      affected one or both cardiac ventricles in a diffuse or multifactorial fashion, and that&#xD;
      produced heart failure, at least in some patients. Although a viral etiology had been&#xD;
      proposed, dilated cardiomyopathy could be associated with numerous genetic and non-genetic&#xD;
      diseases. However in 1987, the role of genetic factors was not known in humans. Although the&#xD;
      condition was usually dismissed as sporadic, numerous families with multiple affected members&#xD;
      have been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of atrial natriuretic peptide levels in the pathogenesis or progression of&#xD;
      idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was just beginning to be explored in 1987. Although Syrian&#xD;
      hamster studies did not suggest a genetic deficiency as the primary cause of dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy in that model, it was thought possible that ANP production or levels were&#xD;
      somehow involved in how the myocardium responds in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were interviewed and asked whether any first-degree relatives were willing&#xD;
      to participate. If family members participated, a three generation pedigree was constructed&#xD;
      and first-degree relatives contacted. The relatives were interviewed for a medical history&#xD;
      and medical records from other institutions were reviewed. Each family member had a brief&#xD;
      cardiovascular examination, a 12-lead electrocardiogram and 2-dimensional, M-mode, and&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiogram. Blood was drawn for determination of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)&#xD;
      levels. The contributions of variability in age, sex, drug use, smoking, and other&#xD;
      concomitants to variability in ANP and echocardiographic data were estimated. After removing&#xD;
      these sources of variability, the strength of similarity among family members was assessed.&#xD;
      The relative contributions of genes and shared environments to the similarity among family&#xD;
      members were estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heterogeneity in the mean levels of echocardiographic indices and ANP levels, familial&#xD;
      aggregation and etiology of aggregation were assessed between families with familial&#xD;
      idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and families with non-familial idiopathic dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
