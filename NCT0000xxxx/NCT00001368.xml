  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early studies have shown that the immune system may play a role in the development of&#xD;
      strokes. Conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and old age can&#xD;
      activate the immune system and increase the risk of developing hardening of the arteries&#xD;
      (atherosclerosis) and damaged blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will attempt to characterize factors that may contribute to atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      stroke by measuring certain components of the immune system, cytokines and leukocyte&#xD;
      activation. Measurements will be taken from patients that are considered to be stroke prone&#xD;
      and from patients without risk factors for the development of stroke. Researchers will&#xD;
      measure the immune system components at the beginning of the study, at six months, and at the&#xD;
      one-year completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will attempt to determine;&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) If patients with risk factors for stroke have an increased activation of the immune system&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) If patients with risk factors for stroke that are symptomatic have higher levels of&#xD;
      immune system activation compared to patients who do not have symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      III) If patients with increased activation of the immune system have accelerated hardening of&#xD;
      the arteries (atherosclerosis)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies indicate that activation of the immune system by risk factors for stroke&#xD;
      (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and age) increases the risk of atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and the formation of intravascular thrombosis. By measuring the levels of cytokine and&#xD;
      leukocyte activation in the stroke prone population and age matched controls without risk&#xD;
      factors, an attempt will be made to characterize those factors which potentially increase the&#xD;
      risk for carotid atherosclerosis and subsequent cerebral infarctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of one hundred twenty subjects with risk factors for stroke and forty controls will&#xD;
      be enrolled over a two year period and followed for one year. All subjects will have blood&#xD;
      drawn at the time of enrollment, at six months, and one year to measure cytokine levels&#xD;
      (including Interleukin-I, Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha, Interleukin-8) and leukocyte&#xD;
      activation/receptor (including Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Endothelial&#xD;
      Leukocyte Adhesion Molecule-1 (ELAM-1), V-Cell Adhesion Molecule (VCAM), and Macrophage&#xD;
      Antigen-1). Carotid dopplers will be performed at the time of enrollment and at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis will be performed to: 1) determine if patients with risk factors for stroke have&#xD;
      an increased activation of baseline cytokine levels and leukocytes, 2) determine if patients&#xD;
      who have stroke risk factors and are symptomatic have an increased activation of cytokines&#xD;
      and leukocyte vs. asymptomatic patients, and 3) determine if patients with increased&#xD;
      cytokine/leukocyte activity have accelerated atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries.&#xD;
