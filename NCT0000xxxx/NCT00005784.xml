  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with certain diseases of the retina&#xD;
      (the layer of light-sensitive tissue that lines the inside of the eyeball). The protocol is&#xD;
      not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will receive the current standard of&#xD;
      care for his or her specific condition. The purpose of the study is twofold: 1) to allow&#xD;
      National Eye Institute physicians to increase their knowledge of retinal eye diseases and&#xD;
      identify possible new avenues of research in this area; and 2) to establish a pool of&#xD;
      patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are developed. (Participants in this&#xD;
      protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision will be voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, vascular occlusive&#xD;
      disease, central serous retinopathy or another retinal disease may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, brief physical examination,&#xD;
      thorough eye examination and blood test. The eye examination includes measurements of eye&#xD;
      pressure and visual acuity (ability to see the vision chart), examination of the pupils and&#xD;
      eye movements, and dilation of the pupils to examine the lens and retina. Patients will also&#xD;
      undergo fundus photography and fluorescein angiography, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus photography - Special photographs of the inside of the eye to help evaluate the&#xD;
           status of the retina and evaluate changes that may occur in the future. From 2 to 20&#xD;
           pictures may be taken, depending on the eye condition. The camera flashes a bright light&#xD;
           into the eye for each picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography - Procedure to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye&#xD;
           injected into an arm vein travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the&#xD;
           retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures&#xD;
           show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood&#xD;
           vessel abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed at least 3 years. Follow-up visits are scheduled according to&#xD;
      the standard of care for the individual patient's eye problem. It is estimated that most&#xD;
      patients will have from one to four follow-up visits each year. Vision will be checked at&#xD;
      each visit, and some of the screening tests described above may be repeated to follow the&#xD;
      progress of disease and evaluate the response to treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This 'Evaluation and Treatment Protocol' will allow the retinal specialists at the NEI to&#xD;
      identify, follow and provide &quot;standard of care&quot; treatment to patients with various retinal&#xD;
      diseases. A primary purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a cohort of patients with&#xD;
      retinal diseases for possible participation in new clinical trials and epidemiological&#xD;
      protocols. Also, by providing long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of retinal&#xD;
      diseases, the retinal specialists at NEI will be better able to identify research hypotheses&#xD;
      about these diseases in addition to maintaining their clinical skills. The availability of&#xD;
      cohorts of patients with a spectrum of retinal diseases will be valuable for the training of&#xD;
      retinal fellows, an important mission of the NEI. The ability to provide long-term follow-up&#xD;
      and care will also facilitate referral efforts for new NEI protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retinal specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those retinal&#xD;
      diseases that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be enrolled in&#xD;
      the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments.&#xD;
      Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of&#xD;
      care for each retinal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for&#xD;
      potential eligibility in any new NEI clinical trials or epidemiologic protocols as they are&#xD;
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However,&#xD;
      they will not be required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be&#xD;
      entirely voluntary. No more than 150 patients will be accepted in this &quot;Evaluation and&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol.&quot;&#xD;
