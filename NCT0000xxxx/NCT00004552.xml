  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether pretreatment with two doses of acamprosate for seven days&#xD;
      prior to abstinence lessens the intensity of acute withdrawal from alcohol compared with a&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either one of two doses of acamprosate&#xD;
      or placebo for seven days. This will be followed by a four- day inpatient period when&#xD;
      withdrawal will be monitored. Additional drinking information will be obtained at a three&#xD;
      month followup interview.&#xD;
