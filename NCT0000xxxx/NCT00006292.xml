      This study will test whether the drug combination of methotrexate and infliximab&#xD;
      (anti-TNF-alpha antibody) is more effective than methotrexate alone for treating rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis early in the disease. (The Food and Drug Administration has approved both treatment&#xD;
      regimens for patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.) The study will also evaluate&#xD;
      how effectively magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect differences in the development of&#xD;
      bone damage in the two treatment groups by as early as 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had rheumatoid arthritis for less than 2 years&#xD;
      and who have four or more affected joints may be eligible for this 1-year study. Patients&#xD;
      must have received methotrexate treatment in the past without complete success, and must not&#xD;
      have been treated previously with Anti-Thymocyte therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive 20 Mg./week of methotrexate. In addition, patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive a monthly infusion of infliximab or placebo (a fluid that&#xD;
      contains no active drug). After 6 months, all patients will receive active infliximab for the&#xD;
      remaining half year of the study. Patients will also receive folic acid (1mg/day), Vitamin D&#xD;
      (400 IU/day), and calcium supplements. They may continue to take prednisone (no more than 10&#xD;
      Mg./day) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Medication dosages will be&#xD;
      adjusted as needed if pain and joint swelling worsen. Over the course of the study, patients&#xD;
      will come to NIH for 15 visits and undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Joint examination-at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Drug side effects evaluation-at every visit during the study and after the study at 24&#xD;
           and 36 months by questionnaires to be filled out and returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hand and feet X-rays at the first visit, at 6 months and at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MRIs of the wrist to examine damage in the bone and synovial tissue (tissue lining the&#xD;
           joint)-before treatment begins and at weeks 15, 27 and 54. For this study, the patient&#xD;
           lies still in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) with a strong magnetic field. A contrast&#xD;
           material (gadolinium) is injected into the blood to enhance the images of the synovium.&#xD;
           The MRI takes about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. DEXA scans (dual emission X-ray absorptiometry) of the lower spine, one hip and one&#xD;
           wrist to measure bone density and assess bone loss-before treatment begins and at weeks&#xD;
           27 and 54. This X-ray test takes about 5 to 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. CTs (computed tomography) of one hand to assess joint damage in the wrist-before&#xD;
           treatment begins and at weeks 27 and 54. Only half the patients in the study will have&#xD;
           this X-ray study, which produces 3-dimensional images of the hand. It will be done to&#xD;
           compare the location, size and change of damage in the wrist seen on CT with the&#xD;
           information obtained on MRI. The procedure takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Blood tests-at every visit to evaluate treatment response and side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current 'gold standard' of measuring osseous damage in patients with RA in the context of&#xD;
      clinical trials is the radiographic evaluation of hands and feet. However, conventional&#xD;
      radiographs are insensitive to change and extended trial duration is required to reliably&#xD;
      document differences of this important surrogate endpoint in the different treatment arms. In&#xD;
      this active treatment controlled double blind trial in patients with erosive RA we want to&#xD;
      test whether a very sensitive imaging modality, MR images of a typically involved joint, the&#xD;
      wrist, can detect differences in the formation of erosions in the two treatment arms with&#xD;
      fewer numbers of patients at 6 months. We plan to enroll a total of 60 patients into the&#xD;
      study, allocating 20 into methotrexate/placebo arm and 40 into a methotrexate/infliximab arm.&#xD;
      The anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody infliximab in combination with methotrexate has been&#xD;
      shown to retard the development of bone erosions on conventional radiographs in patients with&#xD;
      established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at one year. We are proposing to use MRI of the most&#xD;
      severely involved wrist as a highly sensitive imaging modality to assess differences in the&#xD;
      development of new erosions significantly earlier, at 3 and 6 months (primary endpoint) in&#xD;
      the two treatment arms. After 6 months, all patients will receive open label treatment of&#xD;
      methotrexate in combination with infliximab for an additional 6 months followed by a one year&#xD;
      evaluation. We will use MRI again to assess if abnormalities at 6 months are still present at&#xD;
      12 months. Concomitantly we will evaluate the use of bone and cartilage markers as well as&#xD;
      endocrine and metabolic markers before and after treatment with infliximab.&#xD;
