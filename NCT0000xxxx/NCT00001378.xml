  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, chemoprevention study. Patients receive fenretinide daily for 25 of every 28&#xD;
      days for 4 months and tamoxifen daily for 23 months, beginning the second month of&#xD;
      fenretinide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are removed from study for unacceptable toxicity, the development of invasive breast&#xD;
      cancer, or for dysfunctional uterine bleeding.&#xD;

      This is a pilot chemo-prevention study of the combination tamoxifen and 4-HPR in persons at&#xD;
      increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The objectives of the study are to&#xD;
      determine the acute and cumulative toxicity of tamoxifen and 4-HPR in high risk persons; to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of obtaining adequate tissue to study potential intermediate&#xD;
      biomarkers of proliferative disease and malignancy using nipple aspiration, four quadrant&#xD;
      fine needle aspirates, and breast core needle biopsies; and to study the effects of tamoxifen&#xD;
      and 4-HPR on TGF-beta isoforms and the proliferative markers ki67 and PCNA pre- and&#xD;
      post-therapy.&#xD;

        Histologically documented atypical ductal hyperplasia in premenopausal women with 1&#xD;
        first-degree relative (mother or sister) diagnosed with breast cancer.&#xD;
