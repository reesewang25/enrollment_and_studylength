  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to develop improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      techniques and hardware for studying brain function. MRI is a diagnostic tool that provides&#xD;
      information about brain chemistry and physiology. This study will evaluate new MRI methods&#xD;
      for monitoring blood flow to regions of the brain in response to simple tasks. The MRI&#xD;
      machine used in this study is more powerful than those in most hospitals, permitting a higher&#xD;
      visual resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal healthy volunteers over 18 years old may be eligible for this study. Candidates will&#xD;
      be screened with a medical history and questionnaire, and a neurological examination. Study&#xD;
      participants will have a yearly MRI scan. For this procedure, the subject lies on a stretcher&#xD;
      that is moved into a donut-shaped machine with a strong magnetic field. A lightweight&#xD;
      circular or rectangular coil a device that improves the quality of the images may be placed&#xD;
      on the head. The scan time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours; most scans last between 45 and&#xD;
      90 minutes. During the scan, the subject may perform simple tasks, such as listening to&#xD;
      tapes, tapping a finger, moving a hand, watching a screen, or smelling a fragrance. More&#xD;
      complex tasks may require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing&#xD;
      buttons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from this study will be used to develop better imaging methods that will, in&#xD;
      turn, permit a greater understanding of normal and abnormal brain behaviors.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to improve spatial resolution and contrast in MRI studies of&#xD;
      brain anatomy and function, by developing novel hardware, and image acquisition and&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques. Specifically, by improving MRI image quality and manipulating MRI&#xD;
      contrast, we aim to better characterize and quantify structural, chemical, and blood flow&#xD;
      variations across the brain, and study their relationship with neuronal activity. For this&#xD;
      purpose, we will develop and optimize novel MRI techniques on normal, healthy volunteers, and&#xD;
      combine these with EEG and recording of other physiological signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any healthy, male or female volunteer 18 years of age and older; the subjects must be capable&#xD;
      of understanding the procedures and requirements of this study and be willing to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a technical development study design to develop and evaluate new MR technology for&#xD;
      performing MRI and functional MRI in the CNS with novel contrasts and with a high spatial&#xD;
      resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study will be the ability to acquire anatomical and functional&#xD;
      images of the human brain with high spatial resolution, i.e. 200-300 micron and 750-1000&#xD;
      micron respectively. In addition, developed techniques will allow the robust measurement of&#xD;
      specific tissue properties, including diffusion, structural anisotropy, iron and myelin&#xD;
      content, perfusion, and metabolite concentrations. The relative merits of blood flow and&#xD;
      blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) techniques, and their&#xD;
      particular spatial and temporal signal characteristics will be established. It will be&#xD;
      determined whether information valuable to interpret BOLD fMRI can be derived from EEG and&#xD;
      other physiological signals&#xD;
