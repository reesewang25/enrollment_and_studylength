  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the cause and natural history (medical problems that appear over&#xD;
      time) of certain genetic disorders. It will also try to locate the abnormal genes responsible&#xD;
      for these conditions and eventually develop tests to predict who is likely to be affected and&#xD;
      to what degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with known or suspected genetic disorders in certain categories, such as those&#xD;
      involving chromosomal or metabolic abnormalities, immune system or blood disorders, abnormal&#xD;
      growth, benign tumors, and others may be eligible for this study. Participants will be&#xD;
      interviewed by specialists in genetics about their condition and family history. They may&#xD;
      also be asked to have a physical examination and certain tests needed for study of the&#xD;
      specific individual's condition. These may include collection of blood samples (up to 3&#xD;
      tablespoons); imaging studies, such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI), ultrasound and echocardiography; skin biopsy (removal of a small sample of&#xD;
      skin tissue under local anesthetic), and other procedures. DNA testing may reveal the genetic&#xD;
      abnormality responsible for the disorder. Participants who so wish will have an opportunity&#xD;
      to talk with experts about the health implications of the test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may provide information that will lead to improved treatment or management of&#xD;
      these inherited disorders, as well as more effective genetic counseling for families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals and their families affected by disorders with a potentially genetic basis within&#xD;
      six broad categories will be evaluated over time to characterize the natural and clinical&#xD;
      history of various specific disorders. Medical and laboratory evaluations will be completed&#xD;
      to identify areas of management concern that have not been previously described. Further&#xD;
      protocols will be developed addressing specific disorders once a number of affected&#xD;
      individuals have been investigated and is sufficient to query various aspects of those&#xD;
      disorders. Issues for both diagnosis and medical management of those affected with certain&#xD;
      genetic disorders will be collated and addressed within a national consensus conference&#xD;
      format. In addition, phenotype to genotype correlation will be established to further&#xD;
      understanding of specific molecular alterations on phenotypic expression. This broad-based&#xD;
      protocol will also facilitate the training of fellows in medical genetics, graduate and post&#xD;
      graduate training in genetics and genetic counseling.&#xD;
