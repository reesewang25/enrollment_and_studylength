      To investigate the relationship between endogenous estrogen and androgen levels and risk of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease among postmenopausal women in the Women's Health&#xD;
      Initiative-Observational Study (WHI-OS).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of endogenous gonadal hormones in the etiology of atherosclerotic disease needs&#xD;
      clarification. Previous studies of women have been small, rarely prospective, and had other&#xD;
      methodological problems. Results have been inconsistent. Observational and clinical trial&#xD;
      data on exogenous hormones, also inconsistent, are probably irrelevant to endogenous hormonal&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, despite hormonal differences being evoked as the reason for women having&#xD;
      less atherosclerotic disease than men, it is not apparent from existing data that&#xD;
      between-person variability in endogenous hormones is likely to be a strong risk factor for&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease in women. Furthermore, the atherosclerotic process begins early in&#xD;
      life, and postmenopausal hormone differences are only one aspect of possible hormonal effects&#xD;
      on disease. Nevertheless, this study has the potential to provide important new information&#xD;
      on the role of endogenous hormones on atherosclerotic disease in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used a nested-case control design to measure baseline sex steroid hormone levels&#xD;
      (serum total and free estradiol, estrone sulfate, total and free testosterone,&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and sex hormone binding globulin to determine whether these&#xD;
      predicted subsequent risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 350 case subjects and&#xD;
      350 control subjects were selected from women who were free from cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      cancer at study entry and were not using hormone replacement therapy at baseline. Cases were&#xD;
      those women who subsequently developed a documented myocardial infarction or underwent&#xD;
      coronary artery revascularization (N=350), while control subjects were selected from study&#xD;
      participants who remained free from CHD during follow-up. Controls were matched 1:1 for age,&#xD;
      ethnicity, smoking and follow-up time. The study also examined correlations between sex&#xD;
      steroid hormone levels and other previously funded analyses of biomarkers, including&#xD;
      thrombotic and inflammatory markers, lipoproteins, fasting glucose and insulin. Detailed&#xD;
      baseline data including anthropometrics and behavioral factors allowed control for&#xD;
      confounding.&#xD;
