  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary lymphoangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare destructive lung disease typically&#xD;
      affecting women of childbearing age. Currently, there is no effective therapy for the disease&#xD;
      and the prognosis is poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to better study this disease, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)&#xD;
      has developed a registry to keep an official record of patients diagnosed with LAM. This&#xD;
      research project will collect data from 6 health care centers as well as outside physicians.&#xD;
      Researchers hope to provide valuable information about the rate of lung destruction and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with LAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will be followed for 5 years. Tissue collected from&#xD;
      these patients may contribute to the development of future studies on the disease processes&#xD;
      of LAM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LAM is a rare disease that predominantly affects women of child-bearing age. To study in more&#xD;
      detail this rare disease, this multi-center project will establish a registry of persons with&#xD;
      LAM. By combining data from 6 centers and outside physicians, this study may yield valuable&#xD;
      information regarding the rate of decline in pulmonary function and quality of life in&#xD;
      individuals with LAM. These patients will be followed over a five-year period. Tissue&#xD;
      collected from study participants may facilitate future studies into the molecular basis of&#xD;
      LAM.&#xD;
