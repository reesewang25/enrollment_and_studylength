      To evaluate whether red krypton laser treatment is as effective at causing regression of&#xD;
      diabetic disc neovascularization as treatment with the blue-green argon laser, when both&#xD;
      lasers are used with identical panretinal photocoagulation patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the vision of study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the feasibility of a prototype NEI-sponsored multicenter clinical trial in which&#xD;
      participating clinics are not financially reimbursed and in which both the Coordinating and&#xD;
      Fundus Photograph Reading Center functions are carried out by staff of the NEI Biometry and&#xD;
      Epidemiology Program.&#xD;

      The KARNS was a randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effectiveness of argon and&#xD;
      krypton laser photocoagulation in causing the regression of preexisting neovascularization on&#xD;
      the disc (NVD) in diabetic retinopathy. The main theoretical advantage for the krypton laser&#xD;
      in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy is that the red laser beam penetrates blood and may&#xD;
      be more effective in making burns in the pigment epithelium in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burns produced by the krypton laser in the retina are different from those produced by&#xD;
      the argon laser. Specifically, the burns from the krypton laser do not involve the inner&#xD;
      retina. Also, the krypton laser spares the nerve fiber layer near the macula. In contrast,&#xD;
      nerve fiber layer burns are common with the argon laser. Pigment epithelium and outer&#xD;
      segments are usually destroyed by both krypton and argon photocoagulation, but there is no&#xD;
      uptake of energy by the vascular tissues within the retina when krypton photocoagulation is&#xD;
      used. Further, krypton treatment is more effective in penetrating nuclear sclerosis of the&#xD;
      lens and can be used to treat some diabetic eyes with this condition that cannot be treated&#xD;
      with the argon laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the KARNS, patients with diabetic retinopathy and NVD of one-third disc area or greater in&#xD;
      extent were assigned at random to either argon or krypton laser scatter photocoagulation&#xD;
      (panretinal photocoagulation). The null hypothesis was that each treatment would result in a&#xD;
      similar proportion of eyes having regression of the NVD by 3 months. The KARNS pilot study&#xD;
      affirmed the benefits of argon laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy, as demonstrated in the NEI-supported Diabetic Retinopathy Study&#xD;
      conducted a decade ago. (See publication list.) The KARNS study sought to determine whether&#xD;
      use of the krypton laser could be as effective as the argon laser in causing regression of&#xD;
      diabetic neovascularization, but with fewer side effects (such as smaller loss of central&#xD;
      visual acuity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-two nationwide clinical centers participated initially in this multicenter clinical&#xD;
      trial. Following the initial study examination, the baseline examination and fundus&#xD;
      photographs were obtained within 1 week before application of photocoagulation. Study&#xD;
      followup visits occurred at 3 months and 1 year after entry in the study. Additional visits&#xD;
      were scheduled as clinically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific techniques for photocoagulation were similar for both argon and krypton scatter&#xD;
      photocoagulation. Scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation consisted of 1,600 to 2,000 burns&#xD;
      placed 0.5 to 1 burn width apart. Burns of moderate intensity (whiteness) and 500 ??m in size&#xD;
      at the retina were required. The burns were applied to the retinal periphery no closer than 2&#xD;
      disc diameters from the center of the fovea and 500 ??m from the margin of the optic disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 1985, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study groups reported that focal&#xD;
      photocoagulation was effective in reducing the rates of moderate visual loss in patients with&#xD;
      clinically significant diabetic macular edema. The KARNS protocol was then changed to allow&#xD;
      focal treatment for clinically significant macular edema in all study participants and to&#xD;
      allow an eye that had previous focal photocoagulation for macular edema to become eligible&#xD;
      for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study primary end point was regression of NVD, as assessed on the 3-month visit stereo&#xD;
      fundus photographs of the disc, to less than one-third disc area in extent. Secondary end&#xD;
      points included change in extent of NVD, change in visual acuity after photocoagulation,&#xD;
      development of fibrous tissue proliferation, and change or development of macular traction&#xD;
      lines.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Men and women ages 18 through 79 diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and who had&#xD;
        neovascularization on the optic nerve head (NVD) were eligible. NVD in one or both eyes of&#xD;
        each patient had to be greater than or equal to DRS Standard Photograph 10A. NVD was&#xD;
        defined as new vessels on the surface of the retina, further forward in the vitreous cavity&#xD;
        over the disc, or within one disc diameter of the disc in any direction. Patient's ocular&#xD;
        media must have been clear enough for fundus photography, which allowed the extent of&#xD;
        neovascularization on the optic nerve head to be assessed. (If vitreous hemorrhage or other&#xD;
        media opacity prevented adequate visualization of the neovascularization, it would greatly&#xD;
        impair the ability to assess the effect of photocoagulation.) Another requirement for&#xD;
        patient eligibility was the presence of an area of at least three quadrants of the retina&#xD;
        in which full argon or krypton laser panretinal photocoagulation could be placed. (Vitreous&#xD;
        hemorrhage and/or traction retinal detachment that interfered with treatment was less than&#xD;
        one quadrant in extent.)&#xD;
