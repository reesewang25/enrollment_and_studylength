  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether anti-HIV drugs that reduce HIV in the blood also&#xD;
      reduce HIV in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is the fluid found around the brain and&#xD;
      spinal cord. This study also looks at whether reducing HIV in the CSF can help protect brain&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV can be detected in the brain and CSF early in HIV disease. Anti-HIV drugs probably reduce&#xD;
      HIV in the CSF. This may be important because other studies have suggested high CSF HIV&#xD;
      levels may lead to some loss of brain function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-1 RNA emerges in CSF early in the course of HIV disease. Studies have shown that high&#xD;
      levels of HIV-1 RNA in CSF correlate with increased severity of dementia and worsened&#xD;
      performance on neuropsychological tests. While combination antiretroviral treatments are&#xD;
      potent suppressors of HIV-1 replication in plasma, the extent to which these treatments&#xD;
      suppress viral replication in CSF is unknown. A few studies suggest that antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatments can reduce HIV-1 RNA in CSF. However, since CSF is isolated from peripheral immune&#xD;
      responses to HIV and antiretroviral treatment may not readily penetrate the compartment,&#xD;
      researchers hypothesize the remaining virus will overcome the antiretroviral treatment to&#xD;
      achieve high levels of viral replication again. This virologic failure is likely accompanied&#xD;
      by decreased cognitive function. It is therefore critical to determine the ability of&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatments to control HIV-1 replication in the CSF and the durability of that&#xD;
      viral suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolling in one of several AACTG-sponsored potent antiretroviral therapy trials (a&#xD;
      &quot;parent&quot; trial) may enter this study. [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/06/00: Patients already enrolled&#xD;
      in an AACTG-sponsored study who are changing treatment due to virologic failure may also&#xD;
      enter this study.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01: Patients starting a new potent antiretroviral&#xD;
      regimen as part of their clinical care, enrolling in a potent antiretroviral treatment trial,&#xD;
      or changing potent antiretroviral therapy in clinical care or in an ongoing antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment trial because of virologic failure may enter this study.] Patients receive no&#xD;
      treatment but undergo various procedures aimed at characterizing the effects of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapies on CSF viral load and cognitive function. Procedures include: 1)&#xD;
      venipuncture to measure plasma HIV-1 RNA and DNA levels, CD4+ T cell count, and cytokine and&#xD;
      immune activation markers associated with HIV-1 neurological disorders; 2) neuropsychological&#xD;
      examinations to measure cognitive function; and 3) lumbar punctures to obtain CSF samples,&#xD;
      which are used to determine the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents in CSF and to&#xD;
      determine levels of blood cells, cytokine and immune activation markers, and HIV-1 RNA and&#xD;
      DNA. An entry visit must occur before initiating potent antiretroviral therapy in the parent&#xD;
      trial [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/06/00: or before changing the antiretroviral regimen due to&#xD;
      virologic failure in an ongoing trial]. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01: Patients are registered&#xD;
      before initiating a new potent antiretroviral regimen.] Subsequent visits occur within 21&#xD;
      days prior to each lumbar puncture and at Weeks 24 and 52. If evaluations, procedures, or&#xD;
      assays for a given patient's parent trial [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01: for any coenrollment&#xD;
      AACTG study] occur at the times specified in this study, they are not duplicated for this&#xD;
      study. Other visits may occur when a patient changes antiretroviral treatment or discontinues&#xD;
      a parent trial [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01: discontinues a potent antiretroviral therapy].&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have levels of CD4 cells (immune cells that fight infection) less than 200 cells/mm3&#xD;
             and viral loads (level of HIV in the blood) greater than 2,000 copies/ml or viral&#xD;
             loads greater than 50,000 copies/ml and any CD4 cell levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are either: 1) starting a new potent antiretroviral therapy for HIV; 2) enrolling in a&#xD;
             potent antiretroviral trial; or 3) currently participating in an ongoing&#xD;
             antiretroviral trial or in clinical care and will be changing treatment due to&#xD;
             treatment failure. The entry visit for ACTG 736 must occur before starting the&#xD;
             treatment or before changing to the new treatment. (This study has been changed to&#xD;
             include patients who have changed treatment due to treatment failure and those who are&#xD;
             starting a new anti-HIV regimen.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an infection or cancer in the brain or certain diseases of the brain or nervous&#xD;
             system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a serious psychiatric illness (such as schizophrenia or severe depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have completed treatment for a significant infection within 4 weeks of beginning the&#xD;
             study (but certain drugs that fight infection are allowed on this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking drugs to prevent or dissolve blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abuse drugs or alcohol.&#xD;
