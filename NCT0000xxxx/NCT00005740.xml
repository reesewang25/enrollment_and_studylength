      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis was on the decline from the mid 1950s until the mid 1980s; however, the United&#xD;
      States is now experiencing a resurgence of tuberculosis. In 1992, approximately 27,000 new&#xD;
      cases were reported, an increase of about 20 percent from 1985 to 1992. Not only are&#xD;
      tuberculosis cases on the increase, but a serious aspect of the problem is the recent&#xD;
      occurence of outbreaks of multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, which poses an urgent&#xD;
      public health problem and requires rapid intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control programs involve two major components. First, and of highest priority, is to detect&#xD;
      persons with active tuberculosis and treat them with effective antituberculosis drugs, which&#xD;
      prevents death from tuberculosis and stops the transmission of infection to other persons.&#xD;
      Treatment of active tuberculosis involves taking multiple antituberculosis drugs daily or&#xD;
      several times weekly for at least six months. Failure to take the medications for the full&#xD;
      treatment period may mean that the disease is not cured and may recur. If sufficient&#xD;
      medications are not prescribed early and taken regularly, the tuberculosis organism can&#xD;
      become resistant to the drugs, and the drug resistant tubercuosis then may be transmitted to&#xD;
      other persons. Drug resistant disease is difficult and expensive to treat, and in some cases,&#xD;
      cannot be treated with available medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second major goal of control efforts is the detection and treatment of persons who do not&#xD;
      have active tuberculosis, but who have latent tuberculosis infection. These people may be at&#xD;
      high risk of developing active tuberculosis. The only approved treatment modality for&#xD;
      preventive therapy requires treatment daily or twice weekly for a minimum of six months, and&#xD;
      many patients do not complete the full course of therapy. Public and patient programs are&#xD;
      needed to increase the awareness of the problems associated with tuberculosis control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is part of the NHLBI initiative &quot;Behavioral Interventions for Control of&#xD;
      Tuberculosis&quot; . The concept for the initiative originated from the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Working Group on Health and Behavior. The Request for Applications was released in&#xD;
      October, 1994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project, based on social learning theory, was conducted in several phases. First, a&#xD;
      process evaluation of the current contact investigation process was conducted. Results guided&#xD;
      the development of a revised contact investigation protocol, a software program for notebook&#xD;
      computers designed to enhance protocol implementation, and a behavioral intervention to&#xD;
      educate contact investigators in the use of the protocol and software. A formative evaluation&#xD;
      of the intervention, protocol, and software was used to refine the procedures, which were&#xD;
      then implemented throughout the State of Alabama. An impact evaluation was then conducted to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of the procedures. If the impact evaluation results&#xD;
      weresatisfactory, the behavioral intervention and contact investigation procedures would be&#xD;
      developed in a format that could be exported to other areas and settings.&#xD;
