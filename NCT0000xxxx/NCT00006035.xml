      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Electroporation therapy may enhance the ability of chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs to enter tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with electroporation therapy may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to compare the effectiveness of bleomycin with or without&#xD;
      electroporation therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the objective tumor response rate of patients with stage III or IV&#xD;
      melanoma when treated with intratumoral bleomycin with or without electroporation therapy.&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety of electroporation therapy in these patients. III. Compare the time&#xD;
      to heal with these treatments in these patients. IV. Compare the duration of lesion response&#xD;
      with these treatments in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive bleomycin intratumorally on day 1. Arm II: Patients&#xD;
      receive bleomycin intratumorally followed by electroporation therapy intratumorally on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients in arm I&#xD;
      with progressive disease after 1 course of treatment may be crossed over to arm II. Patients&#xD;
      are followed at 4 and 6 months after final treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
