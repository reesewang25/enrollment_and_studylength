  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of immediate versus deferred indinavir&#xD;
      (IDV) in addition to background therapy on disease progression or death in patients with CD4+&#xD;
      cell counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 and plasma HIV RNA levels &gt;= 10,000 copies/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine two management strategies, immediate versus deferred IDV therapy,&#xD;
      for their clinical effects in the context of background antiretroviral (AR) therapy, given&#xD;
      according to current clinical practice. There is an urgent need to identify the optimal use&#xD;
      of IDV in patient management, since clinical endpoint studies have not been completed in the&#xD;
      United States. Since there is little information about the long term durability of clinical&#xD;
      effects, and even less information about the timing of the initiation of protease inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy, exploring the disease progression and survival impact of immediate versus delayed&#xD;
      use of IDV will yield important information to guide clinical decision making for this group&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;

      This study aims to examine two management strategies, immediate versus deferred IDV therapy,&#xD;
      for their clinical effects in the context of background antiretroviral (AR) therapy, given&#xD;
      according to current clinical practice. There is an urgent need to identify the optimal use&#xD;
      of IDV in patient management, since clinical endpoint studies have not been completed in the&#xD;
      United States. Since there is little information about the long term durability of clinical&#xD;
      effects, and even less information about the timing of the initiation of protease inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy, exploring the disease progression and survival impact of immediate versus delayed&#xD;
      use of IDV will yield important information to guide clinical decision making for this group&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization the patient and clinician will determine whether the background&#xD;
      therapy will be zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) or other background antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (OBAT). Patients will then be randomized to IDV or matching placebo. AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      06/27/97: The protocol was closed as of 03/25/97, and all patients have been unblinded to&#xD;
      their assigned treatment. Patients still on study medication are eligible for the protocol&#xD;
      extension. Patients who were randomized to immediate IDV may continue on therapy for up to an&#xD;
      additional 4 months. All study therapy, both for those on immediate or delayed therapy, must&#xD;
      be discontinued on 10/24/97.&#xD;
