  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AMENDED: As of 10/19/90 only Children 0 to 3 months are being enrolled. Original design: To&#xD;
      determine whether the experimental drug recombinant CD4 (rCD4), which is produced through&#xD;
      genetic engineering technology, is safe and well-tolerated in children infected with or at&#xD;
      risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rCD4 may be an effective treatment for HIV infection, based on its ability to block infection&#xD;
      of human cells by HIV in laboratory tests. However, the activity of rCD4 still needs to be&#xD;
      confirmed in clinical trials. It is hoped that these tests will show that rCD4 is both safe&#xD;
      and effective in treating children who are infected with or who are at risk for infection&#xD;
      with HIV.&#xD;

      rCD4 may be an effective treatment for HIV infection, based on its ability to block infection&#xD;
      of human cells by HIV in laboratory tests. However, the activity of rCD4 still needs to be&#xD;
      confirmed in clinical trials. It is hoped that these tests will show that rCD4 is both safe&#xD;
      and effective in treating children who are infected with or who are at risk for infection&#xD;
      with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children have preliminary testing and evaluation to determine eligibility and health. The&#xD;
      dosage schedule varies with the dose. During the course of the study, children are monitored&#xD;
      for safety through physical exams and blood tests. They have blood withdrawn to study the&#xD;
      response to rCD4 and measure the activity of rCD4 in the body. Children may receive&#xD;
      immunization of DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) or DT and a polio vaccine to measure&#xD;
      their antibody response. If the rCD4 is beneficial, children may continue treatment. The&#xD;
      study is conducted in four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A: Children 13 to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B: Children 3 months to less than 13 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part C: Full-term infants over 3 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part D: Preterm infants less than 3 months old. Parts C and D are not started until&#xD;
           parts A and B have been completed.&#xD;
