      To investigate whether traditional risk factors and novel risk factors predict higher risk of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in a prospective study of incident dialysis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a very high mortality especially from cardiovascular disease among patients who are&#xD;
      on dialysis. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading contributor to the&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, accounting for 36&#xD;
      percent of ESRD deaths (total annual mortality of 23 percent). The high mortality among&#xD;
      dialysis patients is a major public health problem and the ability to identify and treat risk&#xD;
      factors that may reduce morbidity and mortality would be of substantial benefit. There are&#xD;
      well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease that certainly are related to morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality among dialysis patients, i.e., relationship to hypertension, diabetes, smoking,&#xD;
      etc. However, some of the new risk factors could also contribute to the excess mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study tested the hypothesis that higher levels of several novel risk factors&#xD;
      (Lp(a) levels and apo(a) isoforms; homocysteine and related vitamins; Chlamydia pneumoniae&#xD;
      and cytomegalovirus; and C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) and traditional risk factors&#xD;
      predicted higher risk of ASCVD in 925 incident dialysis patients recruited within three&#xD;
      months of starting dialysis. Although these factors had been implicated in the etiology of&#xD;
      ASCVD in ESRD patients, little prospective data existed. The cohort had already been&#xD;
      recruited through a collaboration between Johns Hopkins and 80 Dialysis Clinics Incorporated&#xD;
      (DCI) clinics; many of the important predictors and possible confounders had been measured.&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up was obtained by extending mean followup of 2.4 years by four more years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators 1) extended specimen collection, and follow-up, and instituted standardized&#xD;
      review of ASCVD events; 2) characterized baseline associations of novel and traditional&#xD;
      factors with each other, dialysis modality and dose, nutritional status, and ASCVD prevalence&#xD;
      in the full cohort using a cross-sectional design; 3) determined whether baseline levels of&#xD;
      risk factors predicted subsequent incidence of ASCVD events, and total mortality using a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study design and tested a priori hypothesized interactions between risk&#xD;
      factors and the risk of ASCVD; 4) studied the variability of risk factors over time using&#xD;
      annual measurements in a random subset of 180 patients (subcohort) using a longitudinal&#xD;
      design; and lastly, 5) used a case-cohort design, utilizing the subcohort, to test whether&#xD;
      the most recent level before an ASCVD event, the baseline level, or the mean level of each&#xD;
      risk factor was most predictive of ASCVD risk. Baseline data collection included a patient&#xD;
      health questionnaire and a standardized review of comorbidity using dialysis chart records.&#xD;
      Serum, plasma and DNA were stored at -80 degrees C. from patient visits at recruitment (month&#xD;
      0), and followup (months 1,2,3,6,12,8,24, etc.). ASCVD was assessed by review of hospital&#xD;
      charts, patients and care providers questionnaires, and HCFA death forms.&#xD;
