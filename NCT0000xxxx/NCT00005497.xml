    <textblock>
      To conduct a multicenter case-control study of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the&#xD;
      newborn (PPHN) in relation to maternal exposure to smoking and non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Also, to assess other potential antenatal risk factors and&#xD;
      collect and store buccal cell specimens for future analyses.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), previously called persistent fetal&#xD;
      circulation, is a birth defect affecting approximately 1 in 1250 liveborn term infants; even&#xD;
      with complex and high-risk interventions, PPHN results in substantial mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity. This defect results from the inappropriate muscularization of fetal pulmonary&#xD;
      vessels, and experimental and human evidence consistently suggests that maternal cigarette&#xD;
      smoking and antenatal exposure to NSAIDs, particularly aspirin or ibuprofen, may play a role&#xD;
      in the etiology of this condition. Because these exposures are quite prevalent (e.g.,&#xD;
      ibuprofen is currently taken in the first trimester or later in pregnancy by 15 percent and&#xD;
      3.2 percent of women, respectively), testing these hypotheses is of considerable public&#xD;
      health importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multicenter study had a case-control design. There were 560 case infants with PPHN and&#xD;
      four controls per case (2240). All controls were drawn from the birth hospitals of cases;&#xD;
      half the controls had malformations other than PPHN, and half had normal formations. Cases&#xD;
      and controls were identified within five months of birth at 88 birth and tertiary hospitals&#xD;
      in the areas surrounding Boston, Philadelphia, and Toronto. Mothers of subjects were&#xD;
      interviewed by telephone within six months of delivery; a standardized questionnaire inquired&#xD;
      in detail about demographic factors; reproductive, medical, and pregnancy illness histories;&#xD;
      medication use (including a detailed focus on use of over-the-counter analgesic/antipyretic&#xD;
      medications), smoking, and nutrition. Because of emerging genetic research suggesting an&#xD;
      effect of NSAIDs on pathways possibly related to the etiology of PPHN, buccal swabs were also&#xD;
      collected and stored for future analyses. Exposure prevalences were compared between mothers&#xD;
      of cases and controls and relative risks were estimated, controlling for potential&#xD;
      confounding factors.&#xD;
