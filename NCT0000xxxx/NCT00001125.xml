  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine will be safe&#xD;
      and if it can help prevent shingles in HIV-infected children who have already had chickenpox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VZV is the virus that causes chickenpox. If this virus is reactivated in the body, it can&#xD;
      also cause shingles. Shingles is common in children with HIV who have had chickenpox,&#xD;
      although it is usually not life-threatening. The VZV vaccine used in this study may be able&#xD;
      to prevent HIV-positive children who have had chickenpox from developing shingles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varicella (chickenpox) results from primary infection with VZV. Varicella, a common and&#xD;
      usually benign illness in normal children, is more severe in HIV-infected children and may&#xD;
      result in other conditions such as HZ (shingles). HZ is due to reactivation of latent VZV&#xD;
      acquired during varicella and is common in HIV-infected children who have had natural&#xD;
      varicella. While HZ is not likely to be life-threatening in these children, it does cause&#xD;
      considerable morbidity and interferes with quality of life. Use of a live-attenuated VZV&#xD;
      vaccine may be able to boost immunity in these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two immunologic cohorts are enrolled. Cohort A includes children with a CD4 cell percentage&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 20 percent that has been documented as stable for at least the 6&#xD;
      months prior to the time varicella developed (confirmed by a minimum of 2 tests) and a CD4&#xD;
      cell percentage greater than [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99: or equal to] 15 percent that has&#xD;
      been documented as stable for at least the 6 months prior to enrollment (confirmed by a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 tests). Cohort B includes children with a CD4 cell percentage greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 10 percent and less than 15 percent that has been documented as stable for at least&#xD;
      the 6 months prior to the time varicella developed and stable for at least the 6 months prior&#xD;
      to enrollment (confirmed by a minimum of 2 tests). [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/01: Cohort B&#xD;
      includes children who have a CD4 cell percentage less than 15% documented by a minimum of 1&#xD;
      but preferably 2 tests within 1 year of onset of varicella (i.e., within 1 year before to 1&#xD;
      year after varicella) and a CD4 cell percentage greater than or equal to 15% documented by a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 tests at the time of enrollment.] A pilot study precedes the full study. [AS PER&#xD;
      AMENDMENT 10/27/99: The pilot study for Cohort A precedes the full study for Cohort A and the&#xD;
      pilot study for Cohort B. The pilot study for Cohort B precedes the full study for Cohort B.]&#xD;
      The pilot study includes 10 children from each cohort who receive live-attenuated VZV at&#xD;
      Weeks 0 and 8. If 3 pilot-study patients in a cohort meet a toxicity endpoint related to the&#xD;
      vaccine, the dose regimen has failed the safety criteria for that cohort. [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      10/27/99: If 3 children in the pilot study for Cohort A meet a toxicity endpoint deemed to be&#xD;
      related to the vaccine, the dose regimen has failed safety criteria for both cohorts. If 3&#xD;
      children in the pilot phase of Cohort B meet a toxicity endpoint deemed related to the&#xD;
      vaccine, the dose regimen has failed the safety criteria for Cohort B.] If, at 12 weeks after&#xD;
      immunization, at least 5 pilot-study patients in a cohort respond and the safety profile is&#xD;
      deemed adequate, the pilot study extends into a full study with the immunization of an&#xD;
      additional 20 patients from that cohort. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99: If, at Week 12, at least&#xD;
      5 pilot-study patients in Cohort A meet immunologic criteria and the safety profile is deemed&#xD;
      adequate, then the full study for Cohort A and the pilot study for Cohort B opens. If the&#xD;
      same immunologic and safety criteria are met for the pilot study for Cohort B, then the full&#xD;
      study for Cohort B opens.] If either cohort shows an inadequate immunologic response or&#xD;
      safety profile, the study team reviews the results to determine if another regimen should be&#xD;
      considered. In the full study, patients receive 2 immunizations, at Weeks 0 and 8. Varicella&#xD;
      antibody titers and in vitro responder cell frequency (RCF) assays are measured at Weeks 0,&#xD;
      4, 8, 12, 24, 52, 78, and 104. Symptoms, HIV progression, and VZV presence are monitored&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
