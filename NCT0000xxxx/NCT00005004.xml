      This research trial will study discourse processing-that is, how the brain processes the&#xD;
      meaning of language. It will examine, for example, how words and sentences are interpreted in&#xD;
      cases where more than one meaning is possible. The study will include two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An investigation of the role of the prefrontal cortex of the brain in discourse&#xD;
           processing will compare test performance of patients with prefrontal cortex damage with&#xD;
           that of healthy age-matched normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An investigation of the role of aging in discourse processing will compare test&#xD;
           performance of young healthy subjects (18 to 40 years old) with older healthy subjects&#xD;
           (41 to 80 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study candidates-both normal volunteers and patients with brain damage-must be at least&#xD;
      18 years old, speak English as their native language, have a high school degree or equivalent&#xD;
      (GED), read on a minimum fourth grade level and be right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study candidates who have central nervous system disease, dysfunction or trauma will have a&#xD;
      routine history and neurological examination. They will also undergo neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing if they have not already done so. Patients with neurological damage who have not had&#xD;
      a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan within six months or a year will be asked to undergo&#xD;
      this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will take verbal or written tests; sit in front of a computer screen and&#xD;
      press computer keys in response to what they are shown; answer questions from an examiner,&#xD;
      which may be tape-recorded; and fill out questionnaires. There will be rest breaks between&#xD;
      tasks. The studies will be spread over three to four days, with sessions lasting from 30&#xD;
      minutes to three hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to acquire a better understanding of the underlying cognitive&#xD;
      mechanisms involved, and the roles of the prefrontal cortex and normal aging, on various&#xD;
      aspects of discourse processing. For Phase 1 of the investigations, two investigations will&#xD;
      be conducted: Study 1 will compare the performance of patients with prefrontal cortical&#xD;
      damage with age-matched healthy controls; Study 2 will compare the performance of young&#xD;
      healthy subjects with older healthy subjects in various aspects of on-line discourse&#xD;
      processing. The primary focus of our investigations will be on the cognitive mechanism of&#xD;
      suppression, which allows selection of appropriate meanings when information is ambiguous. A&#xD;
      secondary focus will be on the cognitive processes involved in comprehending explicit and&#xD;
      implicit information in stories and appreciating their thematic aspects. In addition, we are&#xD;
      interested in learning how individuals comprehend visual (pictorial) versus propositional&#xD;
      (textual) representations of relational language concepts (e.g., more/less, front/back). From&#xD;
      a cognitive neuroscience perspective, our interests are in investigating the roles of both&#xD;
      the prefrontal cortex (i.e., prefrontal lateral and orbitomedial areas of either hemisphere)&#xD;
      and the normal aging process in these aspects of discourse processing. We predict that: (1)&#xD;
      patients with frontal lobe lesions will have difficulty in suppressing mental activation of&#xD;
      inappropriate meanings of ambiguous text at various points during ongoing processing; (2)&#xD;
      aging reduces the efficiency of suppressing contextually inappropriate meanings of ambiguous&#xD;
      text; (3) prefrontal cortex damage will have deleterious effects on processing implied&#xD;
      information in stories and appreciating their thematic aspects, and (4) prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      damage will impair visual rather than propositional representations of relational language&#xD;
      concepts. Phase 2 of the investigations is designed to extend study into other aspects of&#xD;
      text processing as well as expands to the study and analysis of discourse production. Our&#xD;
      specific intents are to (1) investigate the processing and use of context when encountering&#xD;
      garden path phenomena in text; (2) understand the nature of breakdowns in discourse&#xD;
      production during story tell/retell using sequential pictorial stimuli that probe for&#xD;
      temporal sequencing of events, cohesive ties, cause/effect relationships, anaphoric&#xD;
      reference, inference, and gist; (3) understand what role the prefrontal cortex plays in its&#xD;
      ability to formulate a coherent representation in narrative text inferencing tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our findings will be of value in contributing to knowledge about the neural representation of&#xD;
      the cognitive mechanisms underlying various aspects of discourse processes; advancing&#xD;
      clinical measurements that can pinpoint breakdowns in these processes as they occur in real&#xD;
      time, and understanding the effects of normal aging on discourse processes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects will be between the ages of 18-80, fluent English speakers, premorbidly right&#xD;
        handed, and literate for stimulus sentences that are written at a minimum of a 4th grade&#xD;
        reading level. In addition, all subjects will have a minimum high school or GED education,&#xD;
        sufficient hearing acuity (aided or unaided) and auditory comprehension to follow task&#xD;
        instructions, adequate visual acuity (aided or unaided) to read at least 14 pt. print on a&#xD;
        computer screen, and adequate dexterity to press keyboard keys in response to stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects will have no history of mental, cognitive or other neurological deficits,&#xD;
        adequate hearing and visual acuity (corrected or uncorrected) to follow task instructions&#xD;
        and read at least 14 pt. print on a computer screen, and adequate dexterity to press&#xD;
        keyboard keys to response stimuli. As with BD subjects, healthy subjects will be right&#xD;
        handed, native English speakers, and literate for stimulus sentences. The Mini-Mental State&#xD;
        Examination (Folstein et al., 1975) will be administered as a cognitive screen for healthy&#xD;
        subjects, using a cut-off score of 27 (of total 30) for inclusion on the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For prefrontal BD subjects, only adult patients with focal damage confined to the&#xD;
        prefrontal lateral or orbitomedial areas of either or both hemispheres will be included in&#xD;
        the study. Cortical damage will be determined on the bases of neurological and&#xD;
        neuropsychological examinations and confirmed by MRI or CT studies. All patients with&#xD;
        stroke and penetrating head injury will be tested at least 3 months post-onset of&#xD;
        neurological damage to ensure a stable medical condition. All patients with resected brain&#xD;
        tumor will have completed radiation therapy and regimen of steroid medication. Dates and&#xD;
        course of radiation therapy will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It should be emphasized that the BD subjects to be included on this protocol will have&#xD;
        selective deficits (on the basis of neuropsychological test findings and screening to&#xD;
        determine candidacy) and will be able to understand the purpose of our studies, the&#xD;
        instructions for our tasks, and response demands. Patients who cannot understand the&#xD;
        purpose of our studies, or the instructions or response demands of the tasks would not meet&#xD;
        entry criteria. Only those subjects who pass the screening will be accepted on the&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects will have no history of mental, cognitive or other neurological deficits.&#xD;
