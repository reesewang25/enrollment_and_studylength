      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. IM-862 may stop the growth of colorectal cancer by stopping blood&#xD;
      flow to the tumor. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without&#xD;
      IM-862 in treating colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus IM-862 in&#xD;
      treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of fluorouracil with or without IM-862 in terms of&#xD;
      progression free survival in patients with previously untreated or recurrent metastatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. II. Determine the toxicity of IM-862 and fluorouracil&#xD;
      in these patients. III. Determine the efficacy of IM-862 in combination with irinotecan in&#xD;
      terms of progression free survival in patients who have disease progression after receiving&#xD;
      fluorouracil. IV. Obtain preliminary data on molecular markers of response and time to&#xD;
      progression by determining levels of genes involved in adhesion, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and&#xD;
      drug resistance prior to and during chemotherapy. V. Determine the molecular correlates for&#xD;
      response and time to progression through analysis of serum and urine markers of angiogenesis,&#xD;
      such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor, in patients treated&#xD;
      with IM-862 in combination with fluorouracil or irinotecan. VI. Compare the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study. Patients&#xD;
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV&#xD;
      continuously on days 1-21 and IM-862 intranasally three times daily on days 1-28. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression. Patients who develop disease&#xD;
      progression are taken off fluorouracil and IM-862, and then receive irinotecan IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression. Arm II: Patients receive fluorouracil as in arm I and placebo intranasally three&#xD;
      times daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression.&#xD;
      Patients who develop disease progression are taken off fluorouracil and placebo, and then&#xD;
      receive irinotecan and IM-862 as in arm I on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression. Quality of life is assessed prior to study, and then prior to&#xD;
      every course during study. Patients are followed for a minimum of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (33 per arm) will be accrued for this study within&#xD;
      26-27 months.&#xD;
