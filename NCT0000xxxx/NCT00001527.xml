  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a powerful vasoconstricting peptide produced predominantly by vascular&#xD;
      endothelial cells, that exerts its effect through the interaction with specific receptors,&#xD;
      ETA and ETB, on the underlying smooth muscle cells. Previous studies in normal subjects have&#xD;
      demonstrated an increase in forearm blood flow after ET-1 antagonism, suggesting a&#xD;
      physiologic role of ET-1 in the regulation of basal vascular tone. However, whether&#xD;
      ET-1-mediated tone is increased in hypertensive patients is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study will be to compare the forearm vascular responses to local&#xD;
      infusion of ET-1 receptor antagonists between normotensive and hypertensive subjects in order&#xD;
      to assess whether ET-1-mediated basal tone is increased in patients with hypertension. In&#xD;
      addition, we propose to study the vascular responses to local ET-1 infusion to determine&#xD;
      whether vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to this peptide is increased in hypertensive&#xD;
      vessels. We will use both an ETA receptor antagonist, BQ-123, and an ETB receptor antagonist,&#xD;
      BQ-788, in order to evaluate the relative contribution of the two receptor subtypes to the&#xD;
      regulation of vascular tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs will be infused into the brachial artery and the responses of the forearm&#xD;
      vasculature will be measured by means of strain gauge plethysmography. Because of the&#xD;
      relative long-lasting effect of most of the substances to be infused, the study will be&#xD;
      performed on two separate occasions.&#xD;
