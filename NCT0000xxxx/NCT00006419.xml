      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although tobacco smoking is the major environmental risk factor for COPD, only a minority of&#xD;
      smokers develops this condition, and it appears that genetic and other environmental factors&#xD;
      are important in determining risk. There has been growing interest in the hypothesis that&#xD;
      dietary factors modify COPD risk, possibly by protecting against oxidant injury. Available&#xD;
      data addressing this hypothesis have a variety of methodological limitations that preclude&#xD;
      any firm conclusions. The study was the first to address this hypothesis using data from the&#xD;
      Nurses' Health Study, a large, prospective cohort study with detailed dietary assessments and&#xD;
      a follow-up interval of sufficient duration to examine incident COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examined the relationship between dietary factors and chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) among participants in the Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort&#xD;
      study of 121,700 women, ages 39-64 in 1985. This cohort had been followed by means of&#xD;
      biennial questionnaires which inquired about a variety of topics, including dietary intake&#xD;
      (using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire) and physician diagnosis of&#xD;
      COPD. In 1998, all participants with a history of COPD were sent a supplementary&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding specifics of COPD diagnosis and related topics. The study examined&#xD;
      the relation of dietary factors to risk of newly-diagnosed COPD during 1985-1998. During this&#xD;
      time period, there were approximately 2,100 cases of &quot;confirmed&quot; COPD (i.e., physician&#xD;
      diagnosis and pulmonary function tests [PFTs] at time of diagnosis or abnormal FEV-I in past&#xD;
      year) and &quot;probable&quot; COPD (i.e., physician diagnosis and recent respiratory symptoms, but&#xD;
      PFTs not known). Preliminary data supported the validity of these case definitions, and this&#xD;
      was examined further by reviewing 600 medical records. Likewise, potential under-diagnosis&#xD;
      was examined in a random sample of past and current smokers who had never reported COPD or&#xD;
      asthma. The specific dietary hypotheses were that high intakes of antioxidants (e.g., vitamin&#xD;
      C, vitamin E, and carotenoids), magnesium, potassium, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids&#xD;
      (e.g., fish oils) decreased risk of COPD, whereas high intakes of specific fatty acids (e.g.,&#xD;
      linoieic acid) increased risk. The cohort size and 13-year follow-up provided &gt;90 percent&#xD;
      power to detect a trend across quintiles of dietary intake. In 1998, among approximately&#xD;
      2,400 prevalent cases with diet data, study investigators addressed a secondary aim: to&#xD;
      determine the relation of dietary factors to COPD severity during 1998-2000. COPD severity&#xD;
      was assessed by self-report of current medications, recent symptoms, activity limitations,&#xD;
      and health care utilization (e.g., emergency room or urgent office visits for COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations). The rising prevalence of COPD, particularly among women, along with its high&#xD;
      societal cost, makes COPD prevention an important public health goal.&#xD;
