  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give topotecan through a&#xD;
      vein to treat HIV-infected patients with PML, an opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection&#xD;
      caused by a virus that infects brain tissue and causes damage to the brain and the spinal&#xD;
      cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan fights HIV and the JC virus (the virus that causes PML) in laboratory experiments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topotecan, a cytotoxic DNA topoisomerase-I inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain barrier,&#xD;
      inhibits the replication of JC virus (the virus that causes PML) in vitro, at concentrations&#xD;
      that are not toxic to human cells. Topotecan also inhibits the replication of HIV-1 and the&#xD;
      function of Tat (which upregulates the replication of JC virus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to be treated immediately with topotecan or to have treatment delayed&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. The dosing schedule for patients receiving immediate or delayed treatment is&#xD;
      topotecan as a continuous 21-day intravenous infusion every 28 days. All patients must have&#xD;
      received optimal, stable antiretroviral therapy for 3 weeks prior to entry and preferably&#xD;
      will continue that therapy during the study.&#xD;
