      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1966, the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) began the&#xD;
      development of a twin registry. Through state birth records, a group of twins born in&#xD;
      1917-1927 was ascertained and matched to veteran records to obtain a roster of 16,000 twins&#xD;
      where both members of the pair were in military service. Veterans formed the basis of the&#xD;
      registry because Veterans Administration files provided access to current addresses as well&#xD;
      as potential for mortality follow-up. From this roster, a group of twins living within 200&#xD;
      miles of the examining centers and agreeing to cooperate was examined. This procedure yielded&#xD;
      a set of 514 pairs of twins where both members of the pair were examined. At the time of&#xD;
      initial examination, the World War II veteran twins were 42-56 years old. Since the initial&#xD;
      examination, the twins have been followed by the NAS-NRC to maintain current addresses and&#xD;
      mortality information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World War II veteran cohort was originally examined during the 1969-1973 period at five&#xD;
      examination centers located in Framingham, Massachusetts; Davis, San Francisco, Los Angeles,&#xD;
      California; and Indianapolis, Indiana. The objective of the initial examination was to&#xD;
      estimate the heritability of cardiovascular risk factors. Results of the first examination&#xD;
      showed significant heritability for height, weight, relative weight, systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, glucose tolerance, uric acid, hematocrit, plasma triglycerides, and forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume but not for total plasma cholesterol or any of the lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      fractions&#xD;
&#xD;
      .A second exam of the cohort was completed during 1981-1982. Of the original cohort of 1028&#xD;
      subjects, 792 or 77 percent were reexamined and approximately 5.5% had died. The objective of&#xD;
      the second examination was to assess the change in cardiovascular risk factors over the ten&#xD;
      year interval, assess the disease experience of the cohort and gather additional data on new&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors as well as pulmonary function measurements and covariates.&#xD;
      Examination two differed from examination one in that there was greater opportunity to&#xD;
      standardize data collection for methods, laboratories, equipment, and time of examination.&#xD;
      Greater emphasis was placed on pulmonary function testing. One objective of examination two&#xD;
      that was not achieved was the determination of a sufficient number of cardiovascular events&#xD;
      to do analyses of concordance of disease and analyses of disease occurrence in relation to&#xD;
      risk factors. Analysis of data on 167 monozygotic pairs of twins and 176 dizygotic pairs of&#xD;
      twins showed results similar to those of the first examination for systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure but, unlike the first examination, also showed significant genetic variance&#xD;
      for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. HDL cholesterol continued to show no genetic&#xD;
      variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third examination of the original cohort was conducted in 1986-1987. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the third examination was to assess the incidence of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      pulmonary diseases for analyses relative to risk factor data and determine if the&#xD;
      heritability of cardiovascular disease exceeded what was expected based on the known&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors. Extensive pulmonary function testing was part of examination&#xD;
      three as it was for examination two and provided longitudinal data for analyses of change in&#xD;
      pulmonary function in relation to genetic and environmental factors. The exercise&#xD;
      electrocardiogram was expanded to the entire cohort for examination three to provide&#xD;
      additional data on sub-clinical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was longitudinal in design and consisted of three examinations of the cohort over a&#xD;
      period of eighteen years. Data collected in examination one in 1969-1973 included: a twin&#xD;
      history questionnaire; personal, family and medical histories; a diet history; a physical&#xD;
      examination; numerical data on anthropometry, hematology, and pulmonary function;&#xD;
      supplemental lab data; an X-ray; clinical diagnostic impression; electrocardiogram; and blood&#xD;
      analysis-fasting lipids. Data collected in examination two in 1981-1982 included: a personal&#xD;
      and family history; deceased twin information; residence and occupational history; Thurstone&#xD;
      Activity Scale; leisure time physical activity; social support; medical history; physical&#xD;
      examination; clinical diagnostic impression; job mobility and stress; retirement information;&#xD;
      Jenkins Activity Survey; blood lipid measurements. Data collected in examination three in&#xD;
      1986-1987 included the same data as collected in examination two plus an assessment of the&#xD;
      prevalence for all twins and the incidence for a subgroup of twins of preclinical&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease detected through noninvasive techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up exam in 1986-87 collected baseline data on cognitive performance in 622&#xD;
      individuals, including 132 monozygotic and 134 dizygotic twin pairs. Beginning in December,&#xD;
      1994, a research grant was used to conduct a fourth exam in the surviving subjects of this&#xD;
      cohort that used this rich resource of available data to determine the relationship between&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors collected over 23 years of follow-up, changes in cognitive&#xD;
      function since the last exam, and brain morphology assessed by magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI). Given the mean age of this cohort (72 years) in 1995, the next several years&#xD;
      represented a critical time to monitor age related changes in brain morphology and cognition.&#xD;
      The addition of a fourth exam made the NHLBI Twin Study the longest longitudinal study of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease epidemiology in twin subjects (23 to 25 years of follow-up) and the&#xD;
      first to investigate the contribution of genes and the environment to associations between&#xD;
      CVD risk factors, cognitive performance, and brain morphology. There were five specific&#xD;
      objectives of this study. The first was to evaluate the prospective and cross-sectional&#xD;
      relationships of cardiovascular risk factors collected over 23 years of follow-up (e.g.,&#xD;
      blood pressure, lipids, obesity, smoking) and indices of brain morphology assessed at the&#xD;
      fourth exam. The second objective was to determine the extent that twins discordant for&#xD;
      essential hypertension or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CHD) showed different MRI profiles. The third was to characterize the&#xD;
      neuropsychological changes in performance from Exam 3 to Exam 4 and determine the&#xD;
      contribution of genes and the environment to stability or change. The fourth objective was to&#xD;
      use the data from exams 1 to 3 to investigate prospective relationships between CVD risk&#xD;
      factors and decline in cognitive performance from Exam 3 to Exam 4. The fifth was to&#xD;
      determine the heritability of the new measurements obtained for the first time at the fourth&#xD;
      examination cycle (e.g., MRI measures of infarct area and localization, white matter&#xD;
      hyperintensities (WMHI), and ventricular volumes).&#xD;
