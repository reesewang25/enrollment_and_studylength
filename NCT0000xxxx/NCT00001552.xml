    <textblock>
      The purpose the study is to determine the genetic causes of specific voice disorders that run&#xD;
      in families. Researchers are particularly interested in two conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Spasmodic dysphonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vocal fold paralysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familial vocal fold paralysis can be a life-threatening disorder that can cause difficulty&#xD;
      with vocal fold movement for breathing and voice and sometimes for swallowing. Studies are&#xD;
      ongoing at the NIH to better understand the pathophysiology and to relate it to the genetic&#xD;
      pattern of inheritance. Families are being recruited to participate in these studies and are&#xD;
      being provided with further information on the disorder and genetic counseling if desired.&#xD;
      Physician referral is requested for affected members of families with vocal fold paralysis of&#xD;
      an unknown cause occurring over at least 2 generations. All travel, lodging, examination and&#xD;
      counseling costs are covered for both affected and unaffected members of a family.&#xD;
      Examinations include: voice, laryngeal, neurological, electrodiagnostic testing, genetic&#xD;
      counseling, and radiological studies....&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our purpose is to examine for evidence of genetic risk factors associated with idiopathic&#xD;
      laryngeal motor control disorders. During the conception of the protocol, we were interested&#xD;
      in investigating the pattern of inheritance of familial voice disorders, specifically&#xD;
      spasmodic dysphonia and tremor. Interestingly, the initial search for families revealed&#xD;
      several large families with idiopathic vocal fold paralysis with some family members&#xD;
      experiencing symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia. During subsequent years, the research has&#xD;
      focused on inherited forms of vocal fold paralysis in an attempt to determine the&#xD;
      relationship between the laryngeal motor control disorder and other associated neuropathies,&#xD;
      and to determine the existence of a specific genetic abnormality. These idiopathic laryngeal&#xD;
      motor control disorders were one manifestation of peripheral neuropathies or may be an&#xD;
      isolated disorder with only laryngeal involvement. Subsequently, we have shifted our emphasis&#xD;
      back to the identification of genetic risk factors for spasmodic dysphonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1) Familial risk factors for spasmodic dysphonia result in a particular phenotype&#xD;
      and genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2) Environmental risk factors may differentiate between affected and unaffected&#xD;
      members of families with spasmodic dysphonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3) Whole genome screening will identify SNPs associated with the occurrence of&#xD;
      spasmodic dysphonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families with multiple members affected with spasmodic dysphonia, vocal fold paralysis, and&#xD;
      tremor will be ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pedigree will be developed via a questionnaire and voice history. Affected and unaffected&#xD;
      family members will be examined to determine the presence and extent of their laryngeal motor&#xD;
      control disorder. Affected family members will also undergo neurological examination and&#xD;
      nerve and muscle studies to determine the loci of their pathology. A genotype will be&#xD;
      developed for affected and unaffected family members, through DNA testing of blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a natural history study characterizing the phenotype and genotype of idiopathic&#xD;
      laryngeal motor control disorders.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Symptoms present during speech and not apparent at rest,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Symptoms less evident during whisper, singing or falsetto.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Symptoms become worse with prolonged speaking, practice or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Reflexive and emotional aspects of voice function are unaffected, such as coughing,&#xD;
        laughter or crying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any patient with a history of airway obstruction will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Structural abnormalities affecting the larynx such as vocal fold nodules, polyps,&#xD;
        carcinoma, cysts, contact ulcers, or inflammation (laryngitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Reduction in vocal fold movement range during non-speech tasks such as whistling which&#xD;
        would suggest either paralysis or paresis, joint abnormality or neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No smokers or tobacco users will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with history of a psychiatric disorder, under the care of a psychiatrist, or on&#xD;
        medications for treatment of a psychiatric disorder will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
        Examples of psychiatric disorders to be excluded are: somatoform disorders, conversion&#xD;
        disorders, currently under treatment for a major depression, or a history of schizophrenia&#xD;
        or a bipolar disorder. However, a history of a previous episode of a minor reactive&#xD;
        depression would not exclude a person from participation.&#xD;
