  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how children's bodies metabolize and eliminate the anti-fungal drug&#xD;
      voriconazole. The results will yield information needed to make recommendations for safe and&#xD;
      effective dosing of the drug in children. Children with reduced immune function-such as those&#xD;
      receiving drugs for cancer treatment-are at high risk for serious fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 2 and 12 years old who need treatment to prevent fungal infections may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, eye&#xD;
      examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in the study will be hospitalized for 21 days. They will receive voriconazole twice&#xD;
      a day (every 12 hours) for 8 days, infused through a vein over a period of 1 to 2 hours. The&#xD;
      dose will be determined based on the individual child's weight. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at various intervals before and after the infusions on days 1, 2, 4 and 8 to&#xD;
      determine the amount of drug in the blood. On day 8, the child will have another physical and&#xD;
      eye examination, as well as additional blood and urine tests. If additional treatment is&#xD;
      required, voriconazole may be continued for up to day 21. (Children who require the drug for&#xD;
      more than 21 days may receive it under another research protocol.) On the last day of&#xD;
      treatment, the child will have another physical examination, and blood and urine tests. These&#xD;
      procedures will be repeated again at 30 to 35 days following the last dose of drug. A small&#xD;
      sample of blood will also be analyzed for genetic information related to the rate of&#xD;
      metabolism of voriconazole-that is, how fast or slow it is cleared (eliminated) by the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole is effective against several different fungi. It may protect children against&#xD;
      serious fungal infections with fewer side effects than standard available therapy.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the serum levels and pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      achieved following two dosage levels of voriconazole. In addition, the safety and toleration&#xD;
      of intravenous voriconazole at two dosage levels in an immunocompromised pediatric patient&#xD;
      population will be evaluated. Also, the plasma concentrations of the major metabolite of&#xD;
      voriconazole (N-oxide) in these patients will be performed. The study is designed as a&#xD;
      multi-center, open label multi-dose study of intravenous voriconazole. Intravenous&#xD;
      voriconazole will be administered prophylactically twice daily to immunocompromised children&#xD;
      at high risk for invasive mycoses. The patient population consists of children ages 2 years&#xD;
      to 12 years of age; two age groups will be studied (2-&lt;6, 6-12). Initial dosage levels will&#xD;
      be 3mg/kg q12h and 4mg/kg q12h. The planned sample size is 24 children. For those children&#xD;
      who do not complete the full 8 days of kinetics, a replacement patient will be added.&#xD;
      Immunocompromised children at high risk for invasive mycoses will receive voriconazole&#xD;
      prophylactically. Therapy will be initiated within 48 hours after completion of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Voriconazole therapy will continue until recovery from neutropenia. The first 12 children&#xD;
      will initially receive a loading dose of 6mg/kg X 2 doses followed by 3mg/kg BID through day&#xD;
      4 of therapy. Twelve hour pharmacokinetics will be collected on day 4. Children will then&#xD;
      receive 4mg/kg starting on the second dose of day 4 and will continue at that dosage level&#xD;
      until recovery from neutropenia. Kinetics will again be collected at the 4mg/kg dosage level&#xD;
      on day 8 of therapy. If the mean peak plasma concentration of voriconazole in the first 12&#xD;
      patients following 4mg/kg q12h dosing is less than 4,000ng/ml., the remaining 12 patients&#xD;
      will receive voriconazole after day 4 at a dosage of 5mg/kg.&#xD;

        Children (male or female) ages 2-12 years who require treatment for the prevention of&#xD;
        systemic fungal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children who are expected to develop neutropenia lasting for more than 10 days following&#xD;
        chemotherapy for one of the following conditions: leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, or&#xD;
        as the preparative regimen for bone marrow transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are anticipated to live more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females of child-bearing potential (post-menarchal) must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
        entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed consent of the parent or legally authorized representative obtained prior to&#xD;
        entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Assent will be obtained from minors capable of understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who are receiving and cannot discontinue the following drugs at least 24 hours&#xD;
        prior to study start: terfenadine and cisapride (due to the possibility of QTc&#xD;
        prolongation). Omegprazole (an inhibitor of CYP2C19) which is known to increase plasma&#xD;
        voriconazole levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who have received the following drugs within 14 days prior to study entry:&#xD;
        rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nevirapine and barbiturates as these are&#xD;
        potent inducers of hepatic enzymes and will result in undetectable levels of voriconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who have received astemizole within the previous 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who are taking or are likely to receive any investigational drugs except: used&#xD;
        for cancer treatment, antiretroviral agents, and drugs used for treatments of any AIDS&#xD;
        defining opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with a history or hypersensitivity to or severe intolerance of azole antifungal&#xD;
        agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who have already been entered onto this protocol once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patient with medical history or evidence of cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with AST and ALT greater than or equal to 5XULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (i.e., calculated creatine clearance&#xD;
        less than 30ml/min). If creatinine clearance is reduced to less than 30 ml/min at any time&#xD;
        during the study, the patient must be discontinued from the study. Creatine clearance will&#xD;
        be calculated using the following equation: 0.55 X height (cm)/serum creatinine (mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
        unsuitable for enrollment.&#xD;
