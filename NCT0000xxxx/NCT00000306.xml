      This 27-week double-blind, placebo controlled treatment is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      dextroamphetamine sulfate (sustained release) as an adjunct in concurrent cocaine and opiate&#xD;
      dependent patients. All subjects will receive methadone. For the treatment of cocaine&#xD;
      dependence, subjects will receive one of 2 doses of dextroamphetamine (15 or 30mg) or&#xD;
      placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment the dose level of dextroamphetamine is doubled (30 or&#xD;
      60mg). This dose is maintained for 20 weeks; during which subjects attend twice weekly visits&#xD;
      to the clinic and receive weekly cognitive behavioral therapy. Follow up evaluations will be&#xD;
      conducted out to 3 months post treatment. Subjects will be assisted in transferring to&#xD;
      Houston area methadone clinics to maintain treatment for opiate dependence following&#xD;
      treatment completion.&#xD;
