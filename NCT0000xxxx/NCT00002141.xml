      To assess the safety of single oral doses of 1592U89 (abacavir succinate, ABC) administered&#xD;
      to HIV-positive individuals. To determine the pharmacokinetics of 1592U89 after single oral&#xD;
      doses. To determine the effects of food on the bioavailability of 1592U89.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized in a double-blinded manner, with 12 patients entering the treatment&#xD;
      arm and 6 patients entering the control arm. Patients in the treatment arm receive 6 single&#xD;
      escalating doses of 1592U89 separated by at least a 6-day washout period. Patients in the&#xD;
      control arm receive 6 single oral doses of placebo at least 6 days apart. The second and&#xD;
      third doses of 1592U89 are equivalent. During these doses, investigators study the effects of&#xD;
      food on the pharmacokinetics of 1592U89 by giving half of the patients the second dose with a&#xD;
      standardized, high-fat breakfast and giving the other half the dose in a fasted state. During&#xD;
      the third dose, patients are crossed over so that patients who received the second dose with&#xD;
      a meal now receive it in a fasted state, and vice versa. Following the sixth dose,&#xD;
      investigators break the blind. Patients who received 1592U89 take a seventh dose in solution&#xD;
      form and return for follow-up at least 7 days later; patients who received placebo receive no&#xD;
      further treatment or follow-up. Serial blood and urine samples are collected before and after&#xD;
      each administration of 1592U89 (or placebo) for determination of plasma and urine&#xD;
      concentrations of 1592U89, and investigators monitor patients closely for adverse events or&#xD;
      abnormal laboratory test findings.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV infection, as documented by ELISA/Western blot detection of HIV antibody, positive&#xD;
             p24 antigen assay, positive viral culture, or other accepted technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent of parent or legal guardian if under age 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Debilitating disease, as a result of HIV or associated therapies, that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, might prevent the patient from completing 6-week dosing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction that might interfere with&#xD;
             drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prescription or over-the-counter medication that cannot be withheld for 48 hours prior&#xD;
             to dosing and during the 6 dosing periods. (Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antiretrovirals must be withheld for 24 hours prior to dosing and during the day of&#xD;
             dosing.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other investigational treatments (treatments available through a Treatment IND or&#xD;
             other expanded access mechanism is evaluated individually in consultation with the&#xD;
             sponsor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcoholic beverages within 48 hours before dosing and during the day of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of hepatitis, pancreatitis, or cardiomyopathy within the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk Behavior:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current alcohol or illicit drug use that might interfere with the patient's ability to&#xD;
        comply with the dosing schedule and protocol evaluations, as determined by the&#xD;
        investigator.&#xD;
