  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of the newly developed anti-epileptic drug, levetiracetam,&#xD;
      on excitability of the cortex (surface layer) of the brain. Levetiracetam works differently&#xD;
      from other anti-seizure drugs, but its mechanism is not well understood. This study may&#xD;
      provide insight into a new protection mechanism against seizures as well as the effect of the&#xD;
      drug on cortical excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will have a medical history taken and undergo physical and neurological&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo two different procedures in four separate sessions. One procedure&#xD;
      (cortical excitability) involves taking either levetiracetam or placebo (a look-alike&#xD;
      inactive substance) and having transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The other procedure&#xD;
      (pinch-training related changes) involves taking levetiracetam or placebo, doing a motor&#xD;
      exercise called pinch training, and having transcranial magnetic stimulation. For TMS, a very&#xD;
      brief electrical current is passed through an insulated coil wire placed on the scalp. The&#xD;
      magnetic pulse travels through the scalp and skull, causing small electrical currents in the&#xD;
      cortex that may cause muscle, hand, or arm twitching or it may affect movements or reflexes.&#xD;
      During the study, subjects may be asked to make movements, do simple tasks or tense muscles.&#xD;
      Electrical activity of the muscles will be recorded using electrodes taped to the skin over&#xD;
      the muscle. For the pinch training, the subject makes a brief, brisk pinch after each beat of&#xD;
      a metronome every two seconds and then completely relaxes the hand until the next beat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be tested on four different days at least 72 hours apart. Each session will&#xD;
      last about 3 to 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate schedule for cortical excitability testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS (study 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take levetiracetam or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS (study 2) &lt; 60 minutes after drug or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS (study 3) &lt; 120 minutes after drug or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate schedule for pinch-training related changes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take levetiracetam or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS and pinch power measurement &lt; 60 minutes after drug or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pinch training for 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS and pinch power measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 &lt; LTC and cortical excitability testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 &lt; Placebo and cortical excitability testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3 &lt; LTC and pinch-training related changes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 4 &lt; Placebo and pinch-training related changes&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of newly developed antiepileptic drug,&#xD;
      levetiracetam, on cortical excitability in humans. This drug may be useful in patients with&#xD;
      myoclonus, and its mode of action is not well understood. We plan to determine if oral&#xD;
      administration of levetiracetam in therapeutic dosage alters cortical excitability measured&#xD;
      by transcranial magnetic stimulation as well as long-term potentiation measured by pinching&#xD;
      practice in humans.&#xD;
