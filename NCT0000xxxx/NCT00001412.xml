  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that suggests male sex hormones (androgens) play a significant role in&#xD;
      brain (central nervous system) functioning. In studies conducted with animals, researchers&#xD;
      have documented that male sex hormones (androgens) are associated with neurotransmitter&#xD;
      (serotonin) function, sexual behavior, aggression, and other non-reproductive behavior.&#xD;
      Similar findings have been seen in studies involving humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgens are thought to be involved in some neurologic conditions. Tourette's syndrome which&#xD;
      is seen more often in males than females has caused researchers to look more closely at the&#xD;
      effects of androgens on the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to examine the effects of testosterone on brain (CNS) activity by&#xD;
      first stopping testosterone release and then replacing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will evaluate mood, behavior, cognitive (mental) function, physiologic response&#xD;
      to serotonergic agonists and regional cerebral blood flow (r-CBF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to answer the following questions;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Is a person's mental functioning a result of being male or female (gender) or a result of&#xD;
      the hormonal condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Does the decrease of blood flow (r-CBF) to specific areas of the brain (prefrontal cortex)&#xD;
      in women whose ovaries are not releasing hormones (hypogonadal state) also occur in men&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Will the mental rotation task better identify hormone (gonadal steroid) differences in&#xD;
      r-CBF&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Do hormones directly influence the responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal&#xD;
      (HPA) axis&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Does the hormonal state of a patient directly affect levels of chemicals and steroids in&#xD;
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;

      Several types of evidence suggest that androgens exert clinically significant effects on&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) function. In animal studies, androgens modulate brain serotonin&#xD;
      function, and regulate sexual behavior, aggression, and other non-reproductive behaviors.&#xD;
      These actions reflect both organizational and activational effects of androgens. Several&#xD;
      studies in humans also support the central modulatory capacity of androgens. Correlative&#xD;
      studies have described relationships between plasma androgen levels and sexual&#xD;
      interest/behavior and cognitive task performance. Androgens are believed to underlie gender&#xD;
      related differences in the prevalence of certain neuropsychiatric disorders, resulting in&#xD;
      trials of anti-androgens in at least one of these disorders (Tourette's syndrome). Finally,&#xD;
      androgens are believed to possess psychotropic effects in humans, evidenced by purported&#xD;
      antidepressant effects and reports of psychotic reactions following administration of&#xD;
      androgens. In a recent study, we demonstrated that androgenic/anabolic steroids precipitated&#xD;
      mood and behavioral state disturbances when administered in a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled fashion in normal volunteers. There are remarkably few studies that&#xD;
      attempt to identify the CNS effects of androgens or the central systems that may mediate&#xD;
      these effects. In this study we propose to examine directly the effects of testosterone on&#xD;
      CNS activity by first suppressing and then, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion,&#xD;
      replacing physiological levels of testosterone. We will evaluate mood, behavior, cognitive&#xD;
      function, physiologic response to serotonergic agonists and cerebral blood flow (separate&#xD;
      protocols) during both pharmacologically controlled hormonal conditions: hypogonadism and&#xD;
      hypogonadism with testosterone replacement. On the basis of prior findings from our group and&#xD;
      from others, we will be asking the following questions: 1) Does cognitive function differ as&#xD;
      a function of gender or of hormonal condition; 2) Is the decreased r-CBF that we observed in&#xD;
      the prefrontal cortex during the hypogonadal state in women also demonstrable in men; 3) Do&#xD;
      measures of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsivity differ as a function of gender&#xD;
      or of hormonal condition; and 4) Do CSF neurochemistry and neurosteroid levels differ as a&#xD;
      consequence of changing hormonal state. This protocol will not only provide much needed&#xD;
      information about the behavioral and physiological effects of androgens but will serve as a&#xD;
      companion study for NIMH protocol #92-M-172, &quot;The Central Nervous System Effects of&#xD;
      Pharmacologically Induced Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism with and without Estrogen and&#xD;
      Progressive Replacement.&quot;&#xD;
