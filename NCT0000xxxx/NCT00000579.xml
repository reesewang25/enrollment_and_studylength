      The purposes of this study are to assess rapidly innovative treatment methods in patients&#xD;
      with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as those at risk of developing ARDS&#xD;
      and to create a network of interactive Critical Care Treatment Groups (CCTGs) to establish&#xD;
      and maintain the required infrastructure to perform multiple therapeutic trials that may&#xD;
      involve investigational drugs, approved agents not currently used for treatment of ARDS, or&#xD;
      treatments currently used but whose efficacy has not been well documented.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARDS affects approximately 150,000 people in the United States each year. Despite 20 years of&#xD;
      research into the mechanisms that cause this syndrome and numerous developments in the&#xD;
      technology of mechanical ventilation, the mortality has remained greater than 50 percent.&#xD;
      Many of the patients are young, and to the tragic loss of human life can be added the cost to&#xD;
      society because these patients spend an average of 2 weeks in intensive care units and&#xD;
      require multiple high tech procedures. Because of the overwhelming nature of the lung injury&#xD;
      once it is established, prevention would appear to be the most effective strategy for&#xD;
      improving the outlook in this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic research has identified numerous inflammatory pathways that are associated with the&#xD;
      development of ARDS. Agents that block these mediators prolong survival in animals with lung&#xD;
      injury, and a few of them have been tested in patients. Because of the large number of&#xD;
      putative mediators and the variety of ways that their action can be blocked, the possibility&#xD;
      for new drug development is almost infinite. This is an exciting prospect, since it envisions&#xD;
      the first effective pharmacologic treatment for ARDS. However, preliminary clinical studies&#xD;
      have shown conflicting results, and there is an urgent need for a mechanism to efficiently&#xD;
      and effectively test new drugs in ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment studies in patients with ARDS are difficult to perform for three reasons. The&#xD;
      complicated clinical picture makes it difficult to accumulate a large number of comparable&#xD;
      patients in any one center. There is no agreement on the optimal supportive care of these&#xD;
      critically ill patients. Many of the patients meeting study criteria will not be enrolled in&#xD;
      study protocols because of the acute nature of the disease process. For these reasons,&#xD;
      therapeutic trials in ARDS require multicenter cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept for the initiative was first discussed at a meeting of the Adult Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome Foundation and staff of the Division of Lung Diseases. The results of a&#xD;
      working meeting on uniform definitions in ARDS held at the 1992 meeting of the American&#xD;
      Thoracic Society reinforced the recommendation from the community for National Heart, Lung,&#xD;
      and Blood Institute participation in drug evaluation in ARDS. The concept for the initiative&#xD;
      was approved by the September 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The&#xD;
      Requests for Proposals were released in October 1993.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that over the 12-year period, several multicenter clinical trials will be&#xD;
      developed and implemented. A 12-month Phase I period was devoted to planning and developing&#xD;
      the infrastructure and committee structure and to protocol development and prioritization. In&#xD;
      Phase IIa, staff are trained in data acquisition procedures and patients are enrolled.&#xD;
      Additional protocol development may begin for subsequent studies. In Phase IIb, after the&#xD;
      last patients in the first study have completed their follow-up measurements, data will be&#xD;
      reviewed and the initial study will be closed out. Protocol development continues for&#xD;
      subsequent trials. In Phase III, final data analysis and publication preparation will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of 1,000 patients into the first ARDSNet protocol, &quot;Ketoconazole and Respiratory&#xD;
      Management in Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome&quot; (KARMA) began in the&#xD;
      spring of 1996. KARMA assessed the efficacy of 6 ml/kg versus 12 ml/kg positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS.&#xD;
      It also assessed the efficacy of ketoconazole, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, in&#xD;
      reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS. The&#xD;
      ketoconazole arm was stopped by the Data Monitoring Safety Board (DSMB) in January 1997 after&#xD;
      the enrollment of 234 patients. Ketoconazole did not show any benefit in survival, duration&#xD;
      of ventilation, or any measure of lung function. The ventilator arm of the protocol continued&#xD;
      until March 10, 1999, and compared the efficacy of high (12 ml/kg) and low (6 ml/kg) tidal&#xD;
      volume ventilation in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and&#xD;
      ARDS. The ventilator portion of the trial was stopped on March 10, 1999, on the&#xD;
      recommendation of the DSMB when the data from the first 861 patients showed approximately 25&#xD;
      percent fewer deaths among patients receiving small, rather than large, breaths of air from&#xD;
      the mechanical ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new drug, lisofylline, was selected to replace ketoconazole in the factorial design&#xD;
      ventilation protocol. The lisofylline study (LARMA) began in February 1998. The study tested&#xD;
      the efficacy of lisofylline, an analog of pentoxifylline, that has been shown to protect&#xD;
      against tissue injury mediated by oxidants and to suppress production of a number of cytokine&#xD;
      mediators that amplify the inflammatory process. Patients were randomized to either the high&#xD;
      or low tidal volume ventilation treatment group and between lisofylline and placebo. The aim&#xD;
      of the lisofylline protocol was to determine whether the administration of lisofylline early&#xD;
      after the onset of acute lung injury or ARDS would reduce morbidity or mortality. The study&#xD;
      was cosponsored by Cell Therapeutics Incorporated. The trial was stopped by the DSMB on May&#xD;
      27, 1999, after results were obtained on 221 patients. There was no effect on mortality, time&#xD;
      on ventilation, or organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Late Steroid Rescue Study (LaSRS): The Efficacy of Corticosteroids as Rescue Therapy for&#xD;
      the Late Phase of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome&quot; (LaSRS is pronounced &quot;Lazarus&quot;)&#xD;
      compared the effect of corticosteroids with placebo in the management of late-phase (greater&#xD;
      than 7 days) ARDS. The study determined if the administration of the corticosteroid,&#xD;
      methylprednisolone sodium succinate, in severe ARDS that was either stable or worsening after&#xD;
      7 days, would reduce mortality and morbidity. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints included ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. LaSRS was&#xD;
      designed to include 400 patients and began recruiting in the spring of 1997. In October 1999,&#xD;
      the DSMB reduced the recruitment target number to 200 patients because the eligible patients&#xD;
      were fewer than anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In November 1999, the Network began a new trial as a follow-on to the ventilator trial that&#xD;
      has been named the &quot;Assessment of Low Tidal Volume and Elevated End-Expiratory Pressure to&#xD;
      Obviate Lung Injury&quot; (ALVEOLI). This trial was a prospective, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      multicenter trial that included 549 patients and compared two groups of patients. Patients&#xD;
      were randomized to receive mechanical ventilation with either lower or higher PEEP, which&#xD;
      were set according to different tables of predetermined combinations of PEEP and fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints included&#xD;
      ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. The trial has ended and results were&#xD;
      published in the July 22, 2004, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The results&#xD;
      suggest that in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS who receive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      with a tidal-volume goal of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an end-inspiratory&#xD;
      plateau-pressure limit of 30 centimeters of water, clinical outcomes are similar whether&#xD;
      lower or higher PEEP levels are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Network investigators have developed a plan for a new protocol to assess the pulmonary artery&#xD;
      catheter (PAC) as a management tool in ARDS. The new study was prompted by recommendations&#xD;
      from the FDA/NIH Pulmonary Artery Catheter Clinical Outcomes workshop convened in August 1997&#xD;
      in response to concerns in the medical community regarding the clinical benefit and safety of&#xD;
      PACs. The new protocol in the Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT) is a two-by-two&#xD;
      factorial design comparing the patients receiving PAC or a central venous catheter (CVC) with&#xD;
      one of two fluid management strategies (conservative versus liberal). The randomized,&#xD;
      multicenter trial is designed to include 1,000 patients. The primary end point is mortality&#xD;
      at 60 days. Secondary endpoints include ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. See&#xD;
      NCT00281268 for more information on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albuterol versus Placebo in Acute Lung Injury (ALTA) Study: The Phase II/III study will test&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of aerosolized beta-2 adrenergic agonist therapy (albuterol sulfate)&#xD;
      for reducing mortality in patients with acute lung injury. In Phase II, the safety of&#xD;
      albuterol at the 5-mg dose will be compared to saline in approximately 100 patients. The dose&#xD;
      will be reduced to 2.5 mg if patients exceed defined heart rate limits. Consequently, a Phase&#xD;
      III placebo-controlled double-blinded, randomized trial on approximately 1,000 patients will&#xD;
      compare 60-day mortality and ventilator-free days to Day 28 between the safe albuterol dose&#xD;
      established in Phase II and placebo saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New efforts have been initiated to increase sample collection and utilize collected patient&#xD;
      materials to investigate mechanisms of ARDS pathogenesis. In addition to investigations of&#xD;
      hypotheses related to cytokines and inflammatory mediators, the Network is preparing to&#xD;
      collect samples for future studies of genetic determinants of ARDS. The ARDSNet has been&#xD;
      extended through September 2012, to continue clinical trials.&#xD;
