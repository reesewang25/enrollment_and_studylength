      To determine whether administration of human recombinant erythropoietin (REPO) improved or&#xD;
      eliminated the anemia seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients after&#xD;
      therapy with zidovudine (ZDV).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports had shown that between 24 and 78 percent of patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency&#xD;
      Syndrome treated with zidovudine for four to six months developed significant bone marrow&#xD;
      toxicity, requiring zidovudine dosage alterations, blood transfusions, or cessation of&#xD;
      therapy. While zidovudine efficacy had been demonstrated in patients with AIDS or ARC, it was&#xD;
      also evaluated in patients with AIDS-related illness, as well as in asymptomatic HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals. The clinically significant zidovudine-induced anemia developing in a substantial&#xD;
      number of these patient groups and requiring blood transfusions could cause a significant&#xD;
      drain on the blood supply in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project was part of an Institute-initiated study on the Pathobiology of Bone Marrow&#xD;
      Suppression in AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex. The concept was approved at the May 1987&#xD;
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Applications was released&#xD;
      in December 1987.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind, placebo-controlled. Patients received intravenous REPO (1000 IU/kg) or placebo&#xD;
      twice per week. The five patients in Group A had no transfusion history. The five patients in&#xD;
      Group B had a history of transfusions. Prior to the study, the authors determined that&#xD;
      treatment would continue for twelve weeks or until the hemoglobin reached 12.5 g/dl. After&#xD;
      the twelve week study period, patients were eligible to receive open label erythropoietin&#xD;
      (500 IU/kg, twice a week). For numerous reasons, recruitment of patients was a major problem&#xD;
      in this trial. The study originally estimated a total of 64 patients.&#xD;
