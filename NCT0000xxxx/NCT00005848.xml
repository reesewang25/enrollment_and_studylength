      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      progressive, metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether R115777 has any antitumor activity in patients with&#xD;
      progressive, metastatic, hormone refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 4&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed&#xD;
      every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-16&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate with evidence&#xD;
        of bone, pelvic, lymph node, liver, or lung metastases Radiologic evidence of&#xD;
        hydronephrosis alone does not constitute evidence of metastatic disease Patients with bone&#xD;
        metastases only (i.e., no measurable soft tissue disease) must have PSA level of at least 5&#xD;
        ng/mL Prior bilateral orchiectomy or other prior primary hormonal therapy (e.g., estrogen&#xD;
        therapy, LHRH agonist with or without flutamide or bicalutamide) with evidence of treatment&#xD;
        failure Patients without prior orchiectomy must continue on LHRH agonist therapy At least 4&#xD;
        weeks since prior flutamide (at least 6 weeks since prior bicalutamide or nilutamide) with&#xD;
        continued evidence of progressive disease (i.e., increasing PSA) Must have evidence of&#xD;
        progressive disease, defined by any one or more of the following after completion of&#xD;
        primary hormonal therapy (which must include either orchiectomy or LHRH agonist therapy):&#xD;
        Rising PSA, defined by at least 50% increase above nadir value achieved on prior therapy&#xD;
        Increase confirmed by a second measurement obtained a minimum of 1 week following the index&#xD;
        measurement, and confirmed by a third measurement if the second value is less than the&#xD;
        first increase One of more new bone metastases on radionuclide bone scan or x-ray film New&#xD;
        or enlarging soft tissue metastases Disease related symptoms such as pain not required&#xD;
        Ineligible if an elevated serum acid phosphatase or PSA level is the only evidence of&#xD;
        disease No history of brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0 or 1 Life expectancy:&#xD;
        Not specified Hematopoietic: WBC at least 4,000/mm3 Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm3&#xD;
        Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL SGOT or&#xD;
        SGPT no greater than 2 times normal Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL OR&#xD;
        Creatinine clearance at least 50 mL/min Cardiovascular: No active angina pectoris No New&#xD;
        York Heart Association class II-IV heart disease No myocardial infarction within the past 6&#xD;
        months Other: Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 3 months&#xD;
        after study No other malignancy within the past 3 years No serious concurrent medical&#xD;
        illness or active infection that would preclude study chemotherapy No allergy or&#xD;
        sensitivity to imidazole antifungal medications (e.g., fluconazole, ketoconazole,&#xD;
        miconazole, itraconazole, and clotrimazole)&#xD;
&#xD;
        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No concurrent prophylactic filgrastim (G-CSF),&#xD;
        sargramostim (GM-CSF), or thrombopoietin Chemotherapy: No prior chemotherapy Endocrine&#xD;
        therapy: See Disease Characteristics No other concurrent hormonal therapies (e.g.,&#xD;
        antiandrogens or megestrol acetate) except adrenal replacement dose corticosteroids&#xD;
        Radiotherapy: No prior strontium chloride Sr 89, samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium, or&#xD;
        other radioisotope therapies At least 4 weeks since other prior radiotherapy and recovered&#xD;
        Surgery: See Disease Characteristics Other: At least 1 week since prior and no concurrent&#xD;
        cholesterol lowering medications (e.g., lovastatin, simvastatin) At least 1 week since&#xD;
        prior and no concurrent proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole) Concurrent&#xD;
        H2 receptor antagonists or antacids allowed at least 2 hours following administration of&#xD;
        R115777 No concurrent bisphosphonates (e.g., pamidronate, zoledronate) No concurrent&#xD;
        imidazole antifungal medications&#xD;
