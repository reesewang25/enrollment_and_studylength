  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigation of the causes of genetic defects relating to hereditary urologic malignancies&#xD;
      will be undertaken. These rare disorders result from inherited or newly arising mutations in&#xD;
      genes involved in the development and function of different organ systems. As specific&#xD;
      disease syndromes are recognized and the responsible genes identified, mutations in&#xD;
      individual families can be identified. Correlation of mutation sites with clinical&#xD;
      information will help determine how specific gene segments encode important functional&#xD;
      protein domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families with urologic malignant disorders of known or suspected genetic basis will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Genetic linkage studies will include all available family members, while gene&#xD;
      sequence analysis will be performed on affected individuals. Unaffected family members or&#xD;
      unrelated normal individuals will serve as controls. The family members will be identified by&#xD;
      the proband or proband's parent when the initial pedigree is taken. Subjects considered by&#xD;
      the investigators to be appropriate for linkage studies will be invited to participate by the&#xD;
      local genetics provider or by the investigators, who will then connect these members to their&#xD;
      own local providers for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our studies of inherited urologic malignant disorders, there may be individuals from renal&#xD;
      cancer families who do not undergo clinical evaluation for the presence of an inherited&#xD;
      urologic malignant disorder at the National Institutes of Health because of their health&#xD;
      problems, geographical location, or personal preference. Even though these individuals do not&#xD;
      undergo a clinical evaluation of their suspected inherited urologic malignant disorder at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health, they may have rare diseases that are extremely important to&#xD;
      study. Therefore, we intend to collect blood samples for genetic studies from these&#xD;
      individuals to facilitate linkage analysis and disease gene identification. Samples will be&#xD;
      collected either by the individual's physician and sent to NIH, or will be collected by NIH&#xD;
      physicians at either the individual's off-site location or at the NIH.&#xD;
