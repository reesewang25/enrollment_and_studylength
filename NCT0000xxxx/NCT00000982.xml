      AMENDED 07/07/93: To evaluate whether continuous infusion AZT will impact neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      deficits associated with HIV infection or alter rate of encephalopathy progression in&#xD;
      children who have failed to improve or shown progression of these deficits despite optimal&#xD;
      AZT therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: To assess whether didanosine (ddI) will be better tolerated than AZT administered by&#xD;
      either continuous intravenous delivery or oral administration (ddI arm removed per amended&#xD;
      version).To determine whether ddI will achieve comparable clinical efficacy as the continuous&#xD;
      intravenous route of delivery of AZT, and to assess whether either or both of these regimens&#xD;
      are superior to that achieved with an intermittent AZT dosage schedule. To determine whether&#xD;
      there are differences in patient or parent (guardian) compliance between the three treatment&#xD;
      regimens. Original design: To determine whether the pharmacokinetic profile (bloodstream&#xD;
      levels) of zidovudine (AZT) influences its effectiveness on HIV infection in children. That&#xD;
      is, the study seeks to find out whether there is a difference in the effect of AZT when given&#xD;
      as a continuous intravenous infusion (and, if available, an oral sustained release dose)&#xD;
      compared to an intermittent (not continuous) dose given orally every 6 hours. The study also&#xD;
      plans to determine (1) whether there are differences in the tolerance and side effects&#xD;
      associated with AZT when given on an intermittent schedule as opposed to a steady-state&#xD;
      schedule; (2) the extent of variation from patient to patient in AZT levels and whether the&#xD;
      plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of AZT are related to the degree of therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness; and (3) whether there are differences in the response of children who acquired&#xD;
      HIV infection perinatally (just before, during, or just after the time of birth) versus those&#xD;
      who acquired HIV infection by transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most serious effects of HIV disease in children is neuropsychological&#xD;
      deterioration (relating to mental and nervous system functioning). This complication affects&#xD;
      the vast majority of HIV infected children. A previous study of continuous intravenous&#xD;
      administration of AZT in pediatric patients with HIV infection showed consistent and dramatic&#xD;
      improvements of symptoms in all patients that had shown neurodevelopmental deficits or&#xD;
      abnormalities. These improvements were seen within 3 to 4 weeks after AZT treatment was&#xD;
      started. Neurodevelopmental improvements have been sustained on AZT, usually showing steady&#xD;
      improvement which, in some patients, was associated with restoration of pre-HIV intellectual&#xD;
      and neurological function. This study also showed an increase in the IQ scores of children&#xD;
      receiving continuous infusion of AZT who did not have overt clinical evidence of&#xD;
      encephalopathy (disease of the brain). Thus changes in cognitive function may be among the&#xD;
      earliest signs of AIDS encephalopathy and underscores the need to start therapies that will&#xD;
      treat the central nervous system in patients who appear to be clinically intact. A study&#xD;
      comparing continuous infusion to intermittent dosing of AZT showed a significant increase in&#xD;
      IQ scores for those children receiving the continuous dose compared to those treated with the&#xD;
      intermittent schedule. Although a portable infusion pump allows patients to receive&#xD;
      continuous infusion of AZT, a sustained release oral formulation that could provide a&#xD;
      continuous release of AZT into the bloodstream would be highly desirable.&#xD;

      continuous release of AZT into the bloodstream would be highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED 07/07/93: Children with progressive encephalopathy who have received a minimum of 3&#xD;
      months of oral or intermittent AZT or who have failed to improve following 6 months of&#xD;
      optimal AZT will receive continuous infusion AZT via a portable infusion pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: The oral sustained release has been dropped and is now oral ddI. Added has been a&#xD;
      planned stratification for randomization for patients who received any antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      4 or more weeks prior to study entry. The informed consent was modified to reflect ddI&#xD;
      toxicities from adult studies. Computerized Tomography radiation dosimetry is now included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: Dropping the ddI component and open only to children with encephalopathy meaning&#xD;
      they are losing milestones, this is equal to a P2 CDC rating . Testing the difference in&#xD;
      intermediate vs continuous AZT. 12/1990. Original design: Children are first evaluated for&#xD;
      randomization according to whether they have or do not have evidence of neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      deficits at the time of the initial pretreatment evaluation. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3&#xD;
      groups, to receive AZT (1) by continuous infusion; (2) by oral, intermittent (every 6 hours)&#xD;
      dosing; or (3) by oral sustained-release dosing. If the oral sustained-release formulation is&#xD;
      not available when this study begins, it will begin with only the first 2 groups. The&#xD;
      sustained release preparation will be evaluated as soon as it is available. Patients will be&#xD;
      tested to measure physical or biological improvement in neurodevelopmental function.&#xD;
