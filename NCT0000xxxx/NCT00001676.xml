    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of combination therapy with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine in treating lupus nephritis (kidney inflammation).&#xD;
      This condition, common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, is caused by abnormal&#xD;
      action of immune cells called lymphocytes against the kidneys. Left untreated, severe cases&#xD;
      can result in loss of kidney function. The current treatment of choice-intermittent high&#xD;
      doses (pulses) of cyclophosphamide-does not work in all patients and causes infertility in&#xD;
      many women. The rate of infertility in men is not known. This study will examine whether&#xD;
      fludarabine can safely be given with significantly lower doses of cyclophosphamide, and if&#xD;
      this combination controls kidney inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with severe lupus nephritis (called proliferative lupus&#xD;
      nephritis) may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a history and physical&#xD;
      examination; blood and urine tests; chest X-ray; electrocardiogram; cancer screening that may&#xD;
      include a Pap smear, mammogram, rectal examination, PSA testing, and sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into one of the following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1-Patients undergo three treatment cycles of cyclophosphamide, taken by mouth, and&#xD;
      fludarabine, injected subcutaneously (under the skin). Patients receive both drugs on day 1&#xD;
      of the cycle, and fludarabine alone on days 2 and 3. This regimen is repeated once every 5&#xD;
      weeks for three cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2-Same as for Group 1, except fludarabine injections are given intravenously (through a&#xD;
      vein) for the second treatment cycle. Patients in this group have frequent blood sampling&#xD;
      during the first and second treatment cycles to monitor blood levels of the drug. Samples are&#xD;
      collected before the first injection is given and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours&#xD;
      after the third injection. A total 12 tablespoons of blood is drawn over a 2-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have blood drawn once or twice a week during the first two cycles and then&#xD;
      less frequently to monitor blood counts. Some patients will have the following additional&#xD;
      procedures to test the effects of treatment on lymphocytes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bone marrow aspiration-The skin over the hip bone is cleaned and a local anesthetic is&#xD;
           injected into the outer covering of the bone. Bone marrow is suctioned through the&#xD;
           needle into an attached syringe. The procedure is done before treatment begins, at the&#xD;
           end of treatment, and 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tonsillar biopsy-The tonsils are numbed with a local anesthetic and 1 to 4 pieces of&#xD;
           tissue are removed using special forceps. The procedure is done before treatment begins,&#xD;
           at the end of treatment, and 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen-The patients lies on a table in a narrow&#xD;
           cylinder (the MRI scanner) containing a strong magnetic field, which is used to create&#xD;
           images of parts of the body in small section views.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for at least 24 months to monitor late side effects and the&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;

      Studies at the NIH Clinical Center have shown that intermittent pulse cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      therapy is effective for treating patients with severe lupus nephritis, but may result in&#xD;
      substantial rates of sustained amenorrhea. Initial studies in patients with autoimmune&#xD;
      rheumatic diseases have also suggested a beneficial effect from the lymphocyte-specific&#xD;
      nucleoside analogs chlorodeoxyadenosine and fludarabine. Cyclophosphamide induces DNA&#xD;
      cross-links whereas, nucleoside analogs inhibits DNA repair indicating complementary and&#xD;
      partially synergistic modes of action. Whether combination of lower doses of cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      with nucleoside analogs will increase efficacy while at the same time minimize toxicity from&#xD;
      higher-cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide has not been determined. In this phase I/II&#xD;
      study, 15 patients with proliferative lupus nephritis will be treated as outpatients with a&#xD;
      combination of oral cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m(2)) on day 1 followed by fludarabine (30&#xD;
      mg/m(2)) subcutaneously on days 1, 2 and 3 every month for 3 cycles. The cumulative dose of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide in this regimen is approximately 2.5g as compared to greater than or equal&#xD;
      to 30g in the standard NIH cyclophosphamide regimen. In this study the tolerance and toxicity&#xD;
      of this combination will be studied. Regeneration of T and B cells following depletion&#xD;
      including analysis of antigen-repertoire and function will also be examined. Preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy information, including rates and time to renal remission and rates of preservation&#xD;
      of renal function, will be analyzed to be used for future controlled studies. Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis will be performed on a subset of patients to determine the bioavailability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters of subcutaneous fludarabine.&#xD;
