  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for most end-stage kidney disease. This&#xD;
      procedure is limited, however, by two major factors: 1) a shortage of donor organs and 2)&#xD;
      organ rejection by the recipient. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney&#xD;
      Diseases is screening patients with kidney failure or diabetes who may be eligible for&#xD;
      kidney, kidney and pancreas, or islet cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this screening study are not offered treatment. When the screening is complete,&#xD;
      patients will be offered an opportunity to participate in another institute study, or, if&#xD;
      there are no active studies appropriate for the patient, other options will be suggested to&#xD;
      the primary or referring physician. Patients found eligible for a study are not obligated to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for all patients typically consists of blood tests, urinalysis, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      PPD tuberculosis screen and pregnancy test. Chest and kidney X-rays and other studies may be&#xD;
      done on patients determined eligible for a particular study, including transplantation. A&#xD;
      summary of all test results will be sent to the referring physician unless the patient&#xD;
      requests otherwise.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed for screening of patients with renal failure and/or diabetes who&#xD;
      may be eligible for kidney, kidney-pancreas, or islet cell transplantation. Its purpose is to&#xD;
      allow detailed investigation into the renal and endocrine function of these patients, and the&#xD;
      status of other organ systems that would determine their ability to safely tolerate specific&#xD;
      aspects of other therapeutic research protocols. After completion of this screening process,&#xD;
      the patient will either be offered a chance to participate in an active treatment protocol,&#xD;
      or if no appropriate protocol is identified, will have recommendations for other treatment&#xD;
      options relayed to the primary or referring physicians.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be entered on this protocol at the time of their first visit to the NIH&#xD;
        Clinical Center Outpatient Clinic or Inpatient Services if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient carries the diagnosis of a disorder for which the Transplant Branch has active&#xD;
        research interest, and based on information received from an outside physician, they meet&#xD;
        preliminary eligibility criteria for other specific research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient or the patient's guardian is capable of providing informed consent, and signs&#xD;
        the informed consent after initial counseling by clinical staff. Separate consent forms for&#xD;
        all interventional procedures will be obtained after explanation of the specific procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of known malignancies except basal cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to give legal informed consent by self or legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability or willingness to comply with protocol monitoring and therapy, including, among&#xD;
        others, a history of noncompliance, circumstances where compliance with protocol&#xD;
        requirements is not feasible due to living conditions, travel restrictions, access to&#xD;
        urgent medical services, or access to anti-rejection drugs after the research protocol is&#xD;
        completed.&#xD;
