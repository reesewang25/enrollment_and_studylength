  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: To compare the clinical efficacy of two decision making strategies for initiating or&#xD;
      changing antiretroviral therapy: decision making based on current clinical practice alone&#xD;
      (i.e., initiating or changing therapy based on CD4 count decline and/or clinical progression)&#xD;
      versus decision making based on plasma HIV RNA quantitation in addition to current clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY: To evaluate toxicity, biological markers, and patient management in the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although changing therapies is a common strategy in the treatment of HIV disease, guidelines&#xD;
      are needed to help clinicians and patients decide when a change in antiretroviral therapy is&#xD;
      indicated. The technology of measuring HIV RNA in plasma has been suggested as a tool for&#xD;
      monitoring clinical drug efficacy. However, uncertainty remains about whether aggressive&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment to lower HIV RNA and maintain low levels for as long as possible&#xD;
      will confer clinical benefit in comparison with management based on monitoring CD4 counts and&#xD;
      HIV-related symptoms.&#xD;

      Although changing therapies is a common strategy in the treatment of HIV disease, guidelines&#xD;
      are needed to help clinicians and patients decide when a change in antiretroviral therapy is&#xD;
      indicated. The technology of measuring HIV RNA in plasma has been suggested as a tool for&#xD;
      monitoring clinical drug efficacy. However, uncertainty remains about whether aggressive&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment to lower HIV RNA and maintain low levels for as long as possible&#xD;
      will confer clinical benefit in comparison with management based on monitoring CD4 counts and&#xD;
      HIV-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to a decision making strategy for initiating or changing therapy&#xD;
      based on current clinical practice alone vs. decision making based on plasma HIV RNA&#xD;
      quantitation in addition to current clinical practice in patients with &lt;= 300 CD4+ cells/mm3.&#xD;
      All patients in the RNA arm as well as a subset (n = 183) of those in the CCP arm will have a&#xD;
      plasma HIV RNA quantitation drawn every 4 months. The results of these quantitations will be&#xD;
      blinded until the end of the study. CD4 counts will be obtained at least every 4 months if&#xD;
      the previous count was &gt; 20 cells/mm3. The remaining patients in the CCP arm will have CD4&#xD;
      counts obtained according to their clinicians' current clinical practices. Medications,&#xD;
      clinical status, and changes in antiretroviral therapy will be recorded for all patients in&#xD;
      the study. Patients are stratified by CD4+ cell count (&lt;100 cells/mm3 [200 patients] vs.&#xD;
      100-300 cells/mm3 [900 patients]).&#xD;
