      To determine if selected circulating blood factors that reflect enhanced thrombogenesis are&#xD;
      associated with an increased incidence of recurrent coronary events, including cardiac death&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter, collaborative, prospective study, patients hospitalized with a&#xD;
      myocardial infarction were enrolled from ten geographically dispersed centers. Five&#xD;
      thrombogenic- related blood factors were quantitated, and formed the centerpiece of this&#xD;
      study: 1) lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] - a quantitative genetic factor that contains apolipoprotein&#xD;
      B, has a structural homology to plasminogen, interferes with intrinsic thrombolytic activity,&#xD;
      and represents a crossover link in the thrombogenesis/atherogenesis hypothesis; 2) soluble&#xD;
      fibrin - a system indicator of coagulation activity in the ongoing conversion of fibrinogen&#xD;
      to insoluble fibrin strands; 3) plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) - an important&#xD;
      regulator of the fibrinolytic system, it interferes with intrinsic t-PA activity; 4)&#xD;
      coagulation Factor VII -high levels lead to increased thrombogenesis and have been associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease; and- 5) von Willebrand factor - it binds to&#xD;
      platelet glycoproteins, contributes to local thrombus formation, and it is elevated in&#xD;
      patients at increased risk of coronary thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis utilized a time-dependent survivors hip model (Cox regression) to&#xD;
      determine the presence or absence of an association between one or more of these factors and&#xD;
      subsequent thrombotic-related coronary events. Secondary objectives included: 1) to determine&#xD;
      if there was a statistical association between the thrombogenic factors and conventional&#xD;
      hematologic/lipid parameters, and to evaluate their interactions regarding coronary events;&#xD;
      and 2) to determine if thrombogenic factors had uniform effects on coronary event rates&#xD;
      across various subgroups.&#xD;
