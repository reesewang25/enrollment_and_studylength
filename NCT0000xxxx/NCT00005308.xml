      To estimate the risk of death for patients with different pre- and post-operative hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels who do not receive blood transfusions and to derive a multivariate model using&#xD;
      clinical information available pre-operatively that would predict the risk of death&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AIDS epidemic has focused considerable attention on the risks associated with blood&#xD;
      transfusions. Perhaps of more importance, hemolytic transfusion reactions and&#xD;
      post-transfusion non-A non-B hepatitis continue to be significant concerns. However,&#xD;
      guidelines for blood transfusions in the surgical patient vary considerably in the medical&#xD;
      literature. Some recent texts stress the need to consider factors such as patient's age,&#xD;
      surgical procedure, co-morbid illness, predicted blood loss, and cause of the anemia, as well&#xD;
      as the hemoglobin level. Nonetheless, in practice many surgeons still adhere to the 10g/dl&#xD;
      threshold for transfusion. The lack of consensus guidelines can probably be attributed to the&#xD;
      dearth of studies exploring the indications for transfusion. The few studies which have&#xD;
      examined this question are limited because they fail to analyze subsets of patients by age,&#xD;
      co-morbid illness, or blood loss. The need to develop peri-operative transfusion guidelines&#xD;
      based on multivariate analysis, therefore decreasing the frequency of unnecessary&#xD;
      transfusions resulting from the common use of a hemoglobin threshold, is especially important&#xD;
      in light of the hazards and costs associated with blood transfusions. Jehovah's Witnesses&#xD;
      were chosen as the study population because they decline blood transfusion for religious&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective case-control study explored the possible associations between&#xD;
      peri-operative anemia and post-operative mortality status. Cases were defined as those who&#xD;
      died within 30 days of the operative procedure and controls as all those who survived. There&#xD;
      were approximately eight controls per case. Participating surgeons who operated on Jehovah's&#xD;
      Witness patients within the preceeding five years provide a list of patients. Charts of&#xD;
      patients were reviewed to determine if any died within 30 days of surgery. If the patient was&#xD;
      discharged prior to 30 days postoperatively, then the National Death Index was used to assess&#xD;
      the patient's status 30 days after surgery. The incidence of post-operative death, with 95&#xD;
      percent confidence levels, was calculated for strata of pre- and post-operative hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels and operative blood loss. The death rate was calculated after stratifying the patients&#xD;
      based on status with regard to co-morbid diseases or other possible risk factors.&#xD;
