    <textblock>
      Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a curative treatment for patients with&#xD;
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and other lymphoid/hematologic malignancies but is&#xD;
      available as a treatment option to only a minority of patients. Autologous BMT, coupled with&#xD;
      high dose chemotherapy, is a treatment open to more patients and is a promising strategy for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced solid malignancies. However, the development of potentially&#xD;
      curative marrow transplant alternatives requires an ability to provide a nonmalignant&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell population. In addition, the generation of hematopoietic stem cells&#xD;
      (HSC), and the determination of whether or not such HSC repopulate all of the cell lineage&#xD;
      subtypes following reinfusion are critical to understanding the biology and immunological&#xD;
      consequences of stem cell transplantation. An increased understanding of the kinetics of HSC&#xD;
      and lymphocyte repopulation post-BMT and the identification of donor cell populations that&#xD;
      mediate a graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect or graft versus host (GVHD) is critical to&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy. In order to address these currently unmet objectives, normal volunteers&#xD;
      and volunteers with malignancies will undergo venipuncture and bone marrow aspiration with or&#xD;
      without prior [6,6-(2)H(2)] or [U-(13)C(9)]-glucose, infusion to provide cell populations&#xD;
      which will then be utilized for specific pre-clinical studies aimed at developing new&#xD;
      therapeutic alternatives for patients with CML and other lymphoid/hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
      An infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)] or [U-(13)C(9)]-glucose prior to bone marrow and/or leukocyte&#xD;
      harvest, in some volunteers, will allow direct examination of the genesis and biology of stem&#xD;
      cells and leukocyte subpopulations. [6,6-(2)H(2)] or [U-(13)C(9)]-glucose, are&#xD;
      nonradioactive, stable isotopes of glucose which will label dividing cells during the time of&#xD;
      administration and is chemically identical to glucose, with no adverse side effects other&#xD;
      than those known for glucose.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All volunteers at the Clinical Center will be recruited through and registered with the NIH&#xD;
        Volunteer Office. Volunteers at collaborating institutions will be recruited through&#xD;
        Associate Investigators at that institution according to institutionally IRB approved&#xD;
        methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All volunteers may be normal volunteers or have a diagnosis of a lymphoid/hematologic&#xD;
        malignancy (chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, acute myelogenous&#xD;
        leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible peripheral blood apheresis, all normal volunteers must have a hematocrit of&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 36% and a peripheral platelet count of greater than or equal to&#xD;
        100,000/mm(3). Volunteers with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy must have a hematocrit of&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 30% and a peripheral platelet count of greater than or equal to&#xD;
        100,000/mm(3). All volunteers, including those volunteers with lymphoid/hematologic&#xD;
        malignancies, must have a white blood cell count of greater than or equal to 4,000/mm(3).&#xD;
        Volunteers with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy must have a white blood cell count of&#xD;
        less than 100,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for venipuncture or bone marrow aspiration, normal volunteers and volunteers&#xD;
        with lymphoid/hematologic malignancies must have no history of an abnormal bleeding&#xD;
        tendency or documented predisposition to infection. For venipuncture and bone marrow&#xD;
        aspiration, the peripheral blood platelet count of normal volunteers must be greater than&#xD;
        100,000/mm(3) and for volunteers with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy, the platelet count&#xD;
        must be greater than or equal to 50,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All normal volunteers and volunteers with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy are eligible to&#xD;
        receive apheresis (done only at the NIH Clinical Center), bone marrow sampling, or&#xD;
        venipuncture. Apheresis will only be performed at the Clinical Center of the National&#xD;
        Institutes of Health. Apheresis will not be peformed at collaborating institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers and volunteers with lymphoid/hematopoietic malignancies may donate&#xD;
        samples by apheresis, venipuncture, and bone marrow sampling on multiple occasions.&#xD;
        Repeated donation by apheresis will be allowed as long as a period of at least eight week&#xD;
        has elapsed since a previous apheresis. Repeated donations of peripheral blood or bone&#xD;
        marrow will be allowed as long as a period of at least four weeks has elapsed since a&#xD;
        previous donation. For any given volunteer, the total number of aphereses will not exceed&#xD;
        six per year and the total number of peripheral blood or bone marrow donations will not&#xD;
        exceed eight per year. All normal and CML volunteers must undergo repeat physical&#xD;
        examination and complete blood count evaluation to determine eligibility prior to donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers and volunteers with lymphoid/hematologic malignancies will not be tested&#xD;
        for HIV or hepatitis to determine eligibility for this protocol. However, DTM guidelines&#xD;
        will require that patients undergoing apheresis with subsequent ex vivo elutriation of the&#xD;
        collected products will be required to have testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C.&#xD;
        Volunteers who are required to be tested for HIV and Hepatitis will be informed at the time&#xD;
        of enrollment and will sign an appropriate informed consent for these tests. Volunteers who&#xD;
        are found to be HIV positive or hepatitis B or C can still donate blood products, but these&#xD;
        products will not be subjected to ex vivo elutriation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers with lymphoid/hematologic malignancies may be receiving therapy such as&#xD;
        chemotherapy or chronic interferon alpha injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any normal volunteer or volunteer with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy with significant&#xD;
        history of cardiac, renal, pulmonary, or neurologic disease will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any normal volunteer or volunteer with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy with a known&#xD;
        history of HIV or hepatitis B or C will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any normal volunteer or volunteer with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy requiring chronic&#xD;
        anticoagulation or steroid therapy will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any volunteer with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy with a peripheral blast count that&#xD;
        exceeds 25% or a total lymphocyte count that exceeds 100,000/mm(3) will be ineligible for&#xD;
        apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers with a lymphoid/hematologic malignancy who are currently enrolled in an&#xD;
        experimental therapy on an NCI protocol will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any normal volunteer or volunteer with a lymphoid/Hematologic malignancy with known AIDS&#xD;
        and/or hepatitis B or C will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers with a history of diabetes mellitus will be excluded from receiving [6,6-(2)H]&#xD;
        or [U-(13)C9]-glucose infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A pregnancy test will be given to all female volunteers and volunteers who are pregnant&#xD;
        will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
