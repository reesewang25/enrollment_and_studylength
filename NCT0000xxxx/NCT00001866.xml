    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a new surgical procedure to correct&#xD;
      congenital nystagmus-a disorder of eye muscle-vision-brain coordination characterized by&#xD;
      rapid to and fro eye movements (oscillation). Nystagmus usually begins in infancy or early&#xD;
      childhood; its effect on vision varies greatly among patients. Current treatments, such as&#xD;
      prism glasses, acupuncture, electronic nerve stimulation, contact lenses, various drug&#xD;
      treatments, and others have had limited success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with congenital nystagmus sometimes have other eye problems as well, such as&#xD;
      cataracts, glaucoma, astigmatism or strabismus (cross-eyes). When these patients have eye&#xD;
      muscle surgery to correct a problem, such as strabismus, their nystagmus also improves.&#xD;
      Researchers think that simply cutting the muscles might produce this beneficial effect. This&#xD;
      study will test this hypothesis-the horizontal muscles of the eye will be cut and then&#xD;
      reattached in the same position. This procedure has been tried in one sheepdog with good&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This small preliminary trial will include five adult patients with congenital nystagmus who&#xD;
      have no other treatment options. It will evaluate the safety of the surgery and its effect on&#xD;
      eye oscillation and vision. If the procedure is found to be safe, additional patients will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a medical history, basic physical examination, complete eye examination,&#xD;
      and electro-oculography (eye movement recordings) to determine if eligibility for the study.&#xD;
      Those accepted into the study will undergo eye muscle surgery and followup eye examinations&#xD;
      and electro-oculography at 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open-label pilot study of a new surgical approach never before&#xD;
      performed on humans. Subjects of this study are patients with congenital nystagmus and no&#xD;
      other treatment options. Using standard surgical techniques we will determine if simple&#xD;
      tenotomy with reattachment will reduce their nystagmus. An oculographic reduction of the&#xD;
      nystagmus is measured by the Nystagmus Acuity Function (NAF), considered a primary outcome.&#xD;
      Phase II of the study includes binocular visual acuity as a second primary outcome. A 20%&#xD;
      improvement in NAF will be considered a clinically significant reduction in nystagmus and a&#xD;
      10 letter or greater improvement in binocular vision will be considered a clinically&#xD;
      significant improvement in visual acuity. Secondary oculographic outcomes include breadth or&#xD;
      creation of null zones, slow phase velocity during foveation, and nystagmus intensity. Other&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will include visual functions, assessed pre- and post-operatively using&#xD;
      standard measures of binocular visual acuity (Phase I) and the National Eye Institute-Visual&#xD;
      Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) in patients 18 years or older. Extraocular muscle&#xD;
      proprioception and afferent innervation in control of ocular motor behavior will also be&#xD;
      examined as secondary outcomes. The study will initially be limited to 5 adults 18 years of&#xD;
      age and older (Phase I). However, recognizing that there are many visual differences between&#xD;
      younger and older patients, the study will then be expanded to include children after the&#xD;
      initial pilot study (Phase II). The NEI DSMC, ICRRC, and IRB will assess adverse events after&#xD;
      Phase I, and if in their judgment there are no serious safety concerns surrounding the&#xD;
      procedure, Phase II will be initiated. The initiation of Phase II begins with enrollment of 5&#xD;
      adults and after review of 1 week post-surgical safety data, 5 patients under the age of 18&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Patients who have a clinical and oculographic diagnosis of congenital&#xD;
      nystagmus as determined by a screening exam at NEI and have not had previous extraocular&#xD;
      muscle surgery and have no other nystagmus treatment options (a gaze null or convergence&#xD;
      damping) are eligible. They must be able to undergo a complete ophthalmic and ocular-motor&#xD;
      evaluation and be cooperative for standard eye movement recordings. After informed consent&#xD;
      and assent, eligible patients will undergo a complete ophthalmic and ocular motor&#xD;
      examination. They will have their eye movements recorded using a standard oculographic&#xD;
      recording technique and protocol. In Phase II these recordings will take place three&#xD;
      preoperative visits at least 2 weeks apart and no more than 4 months prior to surgery. Using&#xD;
      routine operative techniques for extraocular muscle surgery, the patient will have all four&#xD;
      horizontal recti tenotomized and reattached at their original insertions. In addition to&#xD;
      routine post-operative care, complete ocular examinations and eye movement recordings will be&#xD;
      repeated at 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and12 months after surgery. The patient's subjective&#xD;
      visual responses (e.g., visual acuity and binocular function) will be compared before and&#xD;
      after surgery. Objective changes in the eye movement recordings and binocular visual acuity&#xD;
      post-operatively will be quantified and compared to preoperative values.&#xD;
