  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine response rate, median time to tumor progression, qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      toxicity and reversibility of toxicity in patients with advanced refractory AIDS-associated&#xD;
      Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) administered a 3-hour infusion of paclitaxel every 14 days. To evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical benefit of paclitaxel in this patient population by evaluating self-reported&#xD;
      responses to the Symptom Distress Scale and by documenting and evaluating any changes in&#xD;
      their lymphedema, pain and disfiguring facial lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are treated with paclitaxel intravenously every 2 weeks up to 10 courses. Patients&#xD;
      who achieve a complete response receive 2 additional courses those who achieve partial&#xD;
      response or stabilization, continue therapy until progression.&#xD;
