    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how laboratory tests called genotyping and&#xD;
      phenotyping assess the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection.&#xD;
      Some HIV-infected patients have measurable levels of virus in their blood even though they&#xD;
      are taking combination drug therapy-including didanosine, stavudine, or efavirenz-against&#xD;
      HIV. Genotyping and phenotyping can be used to test for resistance to a specific drug,&#xD;
      thereby providing information that can help doctors decide on optimal drug treatment for a&#xD;
      given patient. Genotyping identifies mutations, or changes, the virus undergoes that allow it&#xD;
      to continue to grow despite drug treatment. Phenotyping involves growing the virus in test&#xD;
      tubes with different amounts of drug and then calculating how much drug is required to stop&#xD;
      its growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with HIV infection and viral levels between 5000 and&#xD;
      100,000 copies per milliliter of blood who have been taking antiretroviral therapy for at&#xD;
      least 6 months may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a urine test&#xD;
      and various blood tests, including genotyping and phenotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a series of tests to determine whether or not a drug is active against&#xD;
      HIV. This involves temporarily stopping the drug under study (i.e., either efavirenz or&#xD;
      didanosine or stavudine). The study procedure is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will have six blood tests over 10 days to measure viral load while on all&#xD;
           current anti-HIV medications. On one of those days two blood tests will be done to&#xD;
           measure levels of didanosine or stavudine. Efavirenz will also be measured if this drug&#xD;
           is to be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient will temporarily stop the drug under while continuing to take the other&#xD;
           drugs. (Efavirenz will be stopped for 3 weeks; stavudine and didanosine will be stopped&#xD;
           for 2 weeks.) Seven blood tests will be done at the following intervals to measure viral&#xD;
           load: For patients who stop efavirenz, blood will be drawn on days 13, 18, 20, 22, 24,28&#xD;
           and 30. (Day 0 is the first day of the study.) Patients who stop stavudine or didanosine&#xD;
           will have blood drawn on days 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22 and 24. Repeat genotype and&#xD;
           phenotype testing will also be done during this time, and a CD4 count (measurement of a&#xD;
           certain type of white blood cell) will be done at the end of this 2- or 3-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The drug that was stopped will be restarted and viral load tests will be repeated. For&#xD;
           pati...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is limited by the emergence of&#xD;
      drug-resistant virus strains. Development of resistance to one or more antiretroviral drugs&#xD;
      in a HAART regimen may result in substantial rebound viremia and require a new drug regimen.&#xD;
      The use of virus genotyping or phenotyping to identify drugs likely to be active in an&#xD;
      anti-retroviral experienced patient is now recommended, but these tests have limitations and&#xD;
      their clinical utility has not yet been established. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      investigate the correlation between phenotype/genotype to selected antiretroviral agents and&#xD;
      short-term change in viral load upon discontinuation of a single antiretroviral agent from a&#xD;
      failing regimen. For the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and the protease&#xD;
      inhibitors, resistance is poorly understood; thus, we plan to determine whether a change in&#xD;
      viral load occurs after discontinuing these drugs. If so, we plan to correlate those changes&#xD;
      with phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Study participants must have a stable viral&#xD;
      load of at least 1000 copies/ml by bDNA assay despite HAART and must be receiving one of the&#xD;
      anti-retroviral agents designated for study:. Baseline viral load will be established by&#xD;
      multiple bDNA sampling over a 10-day period. Next, the drug of interest will be withdrawn and&#xD;
      the rest of the regimen maintained for either a two week (NRTIs except 3TC, protease&#xD;
      inhibitor) or four week (3TC) discontinuation to assess for change in viral load. Finally,&#xD;
      the withdrawn agent will be re-instituted, and serial sampling for change in viral load,&#xD;
      genotype or phenotype will follow.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to enroll, subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be HIV infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be currently receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy. Drugs available through&#xD;
        expanded access or compassionate use protocols are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have received at least 6 months of HAART therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently be receiving and be willing to temporarily discontinue the selected&#xD;
        antiretroviral for the indicated duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a viral load between 1,000 and 100,000 copies/ml within 6 weeks prior to screen or at&#xD;
        screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If one value is greater than 100,000 copies and one value less, the average of the two&#xD;
        viral loads will be used to determine eligibility. Similarly, if one value is less than&#xD;
        1,000 and one value greater than 1,000, the average viral load will be used to determine&#xD;
        eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have two viral load tests by bDNA method in the NIH laboratory that differ by less than 20%&#xD;
        (log10bDNA) in the three weeks prior to enrollment. Viral loads performed through&#xD;
        participation in another NIAID study are acceptable. Alternatively, new patients coming to&#xD;
        the clinic are permitted to have two screening visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a CD4 T cell number greater than 100 cells within 4 weeks of enrollment or greater&#xD;
        than 100 cells within 8 weeks of enrollment if no more recent CD4 cell count is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be adults age 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Self-report adequate adherence to antiviral medications (missing at most one dose of drug&#xD;
        weekly) and commit to work towards adherence during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to enroll, subjects must not:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a positive pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have evidence of recent HIV infection, defined as a history of a negative HIV ELISA within&#xD;
        12 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have any acute infection that might alter viral load with the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have received a vaccine in the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have symptomatic HIV disease for which rapid institution of a salvage regimen would be&#xD;
        advisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be receiving concomitant medications or have a concomitant illness with malabsorption or&#xD;
        emesis that could be expected to result in inadequate concentrations of antiretroviral&#xD;
        drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be receiving an anti-retroviral regimen that includes drugs that should not be used&#xD;
        concomitantly (e.g., stavudine and zidovudine) or inadvisable dosages of antiretroviral&#xD;
        agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have any laboratory abnormality for which withdrawal of a drug or drug regimen might be&#xD;
        considered. For the purposes of general guidance, Grade III toxicities would result in&#xD;
        exclusion from study with the exception of stable thrombocytopenia or proteinuria or&#xD;
        elevated bilirubin resulting from Gilbert's syndrome or indinavir treatment. Grade II SGOT&#xD;
        or SGPT might be a reason for study exclusion if not explained by underlying hepatitis or&#xD;
        if in a pattern of recent increase over a stable baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have genotypic evidence at screening that would suggest that discontinuing the selected&#xD;
        antiretroviral would result in suboptimal therapy that would clearly place the remainder of&#xD;
        the regimen at risk for the development of new resistance mutations during the&#xD;
        discontinuation period. Two prominent possibilities would be patients taking NNRTI regimens&#xD;
        and discontinuing NRTIs or PI component in patients who have genotypes with no NNRTI&#xD;
        mutations. During the discontinuation period, it would be possible that the patient may&#xD;
        acquire new resistance mutations to NNRTIs. Genotype may be performed as part of the screen&#xD;
        or be performed through PMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have had a change in antiretroviral regimen in the past 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have received cytotoxic chemotherapy including hydroxyurea in the last 6 weeks, or have&#xD;
        anticipated need for chemotherapy during study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have evidence of active hepatitis B infection and wish to interrupt either tenofovir or&#xD;
        3TC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have any suggestion of a trend to increase or decrease in viral load in the past 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have significant active substance abuse or psychiatric illness that might interfere with&#xD;
        study assessments or with your ability to return for study visits.&#xD;
