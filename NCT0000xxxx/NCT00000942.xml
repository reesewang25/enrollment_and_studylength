  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving the anti-HIV drug nevirapine (NVP) to&#xD;
      HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies can help reduce the chance that a mother will&#xD;
      give HIV to her baby during delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies suggest that NVP is a promising medication for blocking HIV transmission&#xD;
      from HIV-positive mothers to their babies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      NVP has several properties that make it an attractive candidate for antiretroviral therapy to&#xD;
      interrupt HIV-1 transmission in the intrapartum and early post-partum period. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile suggests that NVP would be rapidly absorbed and transferred to the&#xD;
      infant in utero when given during labor and delivery. The HIV-1 antiviral activity is rapid&#xD;
      with significant reduction in plasma virus occurring within a few days of drug&#xD;
      administration. In addition, NVP has been shown to penetrate cell-free virions and inactivate&#xD;
      virion-associated RT in situ. This property would be potentially useful in inactivating&#xD;
      cell-free virions in the genital tract as well as in breast milk. These characteristics of&#xD;
      NVP suggest that treatment of an HIV-infected pregnant woman in labor with an oral dose of&#xD;
      NVP may provide a prophylactic level of NVP in the infant during the time of exposure to&#xD;
      virus in the birth canal and/or maternal blood. In addition, NVP may inactivate the&#xD;
      virion-associated RT present in cell-free virions in the genital tract or breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers are randomized to receive either a single oral dose of NVP during labor or the&#xD;
      corresponding NVP placebo. Randomization occurs at any time after the 28th week of gestation.&#xD;
      To assure balance between the treatment groups, the randomization is stratified using 2&#xD;
      factors: 1) use of antiretroviral therapy during the current pregnancy (no antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy at all; monotherapy [with no multi-agent therapy] for any duration; multi-agent&#xD;
      therapy for any duration), and 2) CD4 cell count at the time of randomization (less than 200&#xD;
      cells; 200 to 399 cells; 400 cells or greater). Mothers are followed on-study for 4 to 6&#xD;
      weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the results of ACTG 076 and 185, all women for entry into ACTG 316 are encouraged to&#xD;
      incorporate a regimen of zidovudine (ZDV) into their current treatment regimen and should&#xD;
      continue ZDV during delivery and to their neonates (for at least 6 weeks post-birth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants receive a single oral dose of NVP (or the corresponding placebo) administered between&#xD;
      48 and 72 hours of life. The infant's study drug is the same as the mother's randomized&#xD;
      treatment assignment. Infants are dosed with study drug according to their randomization&#xD;
      group regardless of whether the mother received study drug or not. Infants are followed for 6&#xD;
      months of life, and are tested for HIV at birth, 4 to 6 weeks of life, 3 months of life, and&#xD;
      6 months of life.&#xD;
