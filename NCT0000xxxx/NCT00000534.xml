      To evaluate the efficacy of 2 grams per day of oral calcium supplementation in reducing the&#xD;
      combined incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and the&#xD;
      HELLP Syndrome (hypertension, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and abnormal liver function). The&#xD;
      National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) initiated the trial in 1991,&#xD;
      with joint funding provided by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in fiscal years&#xD;
      1992, 1993, and 1995.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A considerable body of data has associated lower blood pressures with higher levels of&#xD;
      dietary calcium. Epidemiologic studies, laboratory evaluations, and clinical trials have also&#xD;
      indicated that the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is affected similarly by&#xD;
      calcium intake. A meta-analysis of five controlled clinical trials of calcium supplementation&#xD;
      in pregnancy suggested a significant reduction in proteinuric pre-eclampsia of 46 percent.&#xD;
      Several of the trials, however, suffered from 'pitfalls' in the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia,&#xD;
      including lack of blinding, uncertain definition of endpoints, and unknown techniques of&#xD;
      measurement. Most trials have not assessed the role of dietary nutrients or the possibility&#xD;
      that a subgroup with low baseline urinary calcium may benefit most from calcium&#xD;
      supplementation. In no trial has the potential for increased risk of kidney stones in the&#xD;
      treatment group been examined systematically. Moreover, the daily schedule for administration&#xD;
      of calcium, has generally not been reported. There was a great need, therefore, to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of calcium supplementation for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in a large&#xD;
      multicenter controlled clinical trial. The trial considered the role of dietary nutrients,&#xD;
      establish whether treatment is beneficial only for those with low baseline urinary calcium,&#xD;
      conduct systematic surveillance for urolithiasis, and employ standardized terminology,&#xD;
      techniques of measurement, and diagnostic criteria. The NHLBI provided funding to NICHD for&#xD;
      three years by means of an Intraagency Agreement (Y01HC20154).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind, multicenter. Healthy nulliparous patients were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either 2 grams of supplemental calcium daily ((n = 2,295) or placebo (n = 2,294) in a&#xD;
      double-blind study. Study tablets were administered beginning from 13 to 21 completed weeks&#xD;
      of gestation and continued until the termination of pregnancy. Eligible patients entered a&#xD;
      run-in period of 6 to 14 days to exclude highly noncompliant subjects. During the run-in,&#xD;
      obstetrical ultrasound was performed if it had not been obtained previously, and blood was&#xD;
      drawn for serum calcium and creatinine. Follow-up visits were scheduled every four weeks&#xD;
      through the 29th week of gestation, then every two weeks through the 35th week, and weekly&#xD;
      thereafter. Blood pressure and urine-protein were obtained at each clinic visit, during labor&#xD;
      and delivery, and during the first 24 hours postpartum. Primary endpoints included&#xD;
      pregnancy-associated hypertension, pregnancy-associated proteinuria, pre-eclampsia,&#xD;
      eclampsia, or hypertension. Other endpoints included placental abruption, cerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
      or thrombosis, elevated liver enzymes, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular&#xD;
      coagulation. Surveillance was conducted for renal calculi. Recruitment began in May 1992 and&#xD;
      ended in March 1995. Follow-up was completed in October of 1995. Data analysis continued&#xD;
      through March 2000 under the NICHD contract N01HD13121.&#xD;
