      To determine the risk of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis C virus (HCV) in cardiac surgery&#xD;
      patients before and after donor screening for anti-HCV and surrogate markers of non-A, non-B&#xD;
      hepatitis (NANBH). Also, to characterize donors who were HCV seronegative and who lacked&#xD;
      surrogate markers at the time of donation, but whose recipient seroconverted to HCV.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early 1990s, posttransfusion NANBH, mainly caused by HCV, was the most common serious&#xD;
      complication of transfusions, occurring in 2-5 percent of transfusion recipients. About 50&#xD;
      percent of those infected developed chronic hepatitis, of whom, 10 to 20 percent developed&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma had been reported to occur in some. This study provided&#xD;
      the first evaluation of the effectiveness of donor screening for anti-HCV by the then&#xD;
      recently licensed HCV antibody test and surrogate markers of NANBH. It also provided a&#xD;
      precise estimate of the risk of transfusion-transmitted HCV. The results allowed examination&#xD;
      of risk factors for HCV infected donors who were seronegative at the time of donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a nonconcurrent prospective, seroepidemiologic study. To estimate the incidence&#xD;
      of HCV infection, six-month postoperative serum samples were tested for antibody to HCV.&#xD;
      Preoperative samples corresponding to positive postoperative sera were also tested. The&#xD;
      donors of a patient who received blood screened for HCV, i.e., a donation since May, 1990,&#xD;
      and seroconverted in the six months since transfusion were located and retested for&#xD;
      antibodies to HCV. The donors were administered a questionnaire designed to ascertain risk&#xD;
      factors for HCV infection. A sample of donors who were HCV positive at the time of donation&#xD;
      were given the same questionnaire. Comparison of these three groups of donors (i.e.,&#xD;
      seropositives, donors tested negative but implicated in seroconversion, seronegatives)&#xD;
      allowed an investigation of factors associated with false negative screening results.&#xD;
      Analytical methods included standard methods for contingency tables and both conditional and&#xD;
      unconditional logistic regression.&#xD;
