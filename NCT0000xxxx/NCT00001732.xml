  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This screening protocol is designed to help recruit patients for National Eye Institute (NEI)&#xD;
      studies on inherited eye diseases. Patients must meet specific requirements of a research&#xD;
      study, and this protocol serves as a first step for admitting patients to an appropriate&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will undergo a medical history, physical examination, eye examination and blood&#xD;
      test. The eye examination includes measurement of eye pressure and dilation of the pupils to&#xD;
      fully examine the lens, vitreous and retina. Specialized tests will be done only if needed to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for a specific study in NEI's Ophthalmic Genetics Clinic. These include&#xD;
      routine laboratory tests, non-invasive imaging, questionnaires and other standard tests, as&#xD;
      well as specialized tests and procedures where needed, including genetic testing. Photographs&#xD;
      of the eye may be taken. Patients will be asked questions about family history, especially&#xD;
      relating to eye disease or cataracts, and a family tree will be drawn. A blood sample will&#xD;
      also be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the screening is completed, patients will be informed of their options to participate in&#xD;
      a study. Patients who are ineligible for a current study will be informed of alternative&#xD;
      treatments or options. No treatment is offered under this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed for the screening of patients with either diagnosed or undiagnosed&#xD;
      conditions, and serves as a first step for individuals who may be eligible, and wish to&#xD;
      participate in NEI clinical research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual will be thoroughly evaluated during the screening process to determine if&#xD;
      they are suitable candidates for inclusion in any of the NEI ongoing studies. The screening&#xD;
      evaluation will include past and current medical histories, and an appropriate physical&#xD;
      examination. Other routine diagnostic procedures and tests may also be completed in order to&#xD;
      help determine a subject's eligibility. These tests and procedures are of minimal risk and&#xD;
      will be described in more detail in section III: &quot;Study Procedures&quot;. Once the screening&#xD;
      process is completed and their eligibility is assessed, the subjects will be informed of&#xD;
      their options to participate in one or more of the current clinical research studies. If no&#xD;
      appropriate protocol is identified, recommendations for other treatment options may be given&#xD;
      to the individual, their primary doctor, or referring physician.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion and exclusion criteria vary with the particular protocol for which a patient is&#xD;
        being screened. in addition to those diagnoses currently under study, subjects with&#xD;
        unusual, interesting, or unknown conditions that require the establishment of a diagnosis,&#xD;
        may be eligible for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects source for this study will be from referrals by medical practitioners in the&#xD;
        private sector, clinics, hospitals, medical institutions, and the Occupational Medical&#xD;
        Services at the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
