  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of intravenous ganciclovir (also known as DHPG) in&#xD;
      the treatment of sight-threatening cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. CMV&#xD;
      retinitis is a severe vision-threatening viral infection of the retina of the eye. It occurs&#xD;
      in patients whose immune function has been impaired and is the most common cause of blindness&#xD;
      in patients with AIDS. Ganciclovir (GCV) improved the signs and symptoms of CMV retinitis in&#xD;
      approximately 80 percent of the patients treated for 2 weeks, but almost all of the patients&#xD;
      treated with GCV had a relapse after treatment was stopped. Thus, it is important to&#xD;
      determine if GCV can be safely given over a long period of time (maintenance therapy) and if&#xD;
      it is effective in preventing a relapse of CMV retinitis.&#xD;

      CMV retinitis is a severe vision-threatening viral infection of the retina of the eye. It&#xD;
      occurs in patients whose immune function has been impaired and is the most common cause of&#xD;
      blindness in patients with AIDS. Ganciclovir (GCV) improved the signs and symptoms of CMV&#xD;
      retinitis in approximately 80 percent of the patients treated for 2 weeks, but almost all of&#xD;
      the patients treated with GCV had a relapse after treatment was stopped. Thus, it is&#xD;
      important to determine if GCV can be safely given over a long period of time (maintenance&#xD;
      therapy) and if it is effective in preventing a relapse of CMV retinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are given GCV intravenously for 14 days. Then the patient receives the same dose,&#xD;
      but only once a day, for as long as therapy is tolerated. If the retinitis worsens during the&#xD;
      maintenance phase, the patient may again be given GCV for 14 days. Long-term treatment with&#xD;
      GCV usually requires the surgical placement of a catheter in a large central vein in the&#xD;
      chest or groin that is left in place indefinitely. If this is required, the procedure will be&#xD;
      explained to the patient.&#xD;
