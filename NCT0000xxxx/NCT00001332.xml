  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma are most frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage. The&#xD;
      disease has a marked propensity for loco-regional spread and will be the sole or major site&#xD;
      of disease in up to 80% of patients. Various attempts at controlling loco-regional disease&#xD;
      have not been successful. The selective lethal effect of supranormal temperatures on&#xD;
      neoplastic cells and the additive or synergistic effect of combining chemotherapy has been&#xD;
      well established in laboratory models and has provided the rationale for numerous clinical&#xD;
      trials using hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion for advanced extremity melanoma or sarcoma.&#xD;
      This Phase I study will evaluate the safety of escalating temperatures of continuous&#xD;
      hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP) with escalating doses of intraperitoneal Cisplatin&#xD;
      (CDDP) in the treatment of patients with advanced peritoneal adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal origin.&#xD;

        Patients age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with histologically proven gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, or&#xD;
        sarcoma. By standard staging studies there must be evidence of advanced or metastatic&#xD;
        intraabdominal disease. Patients with minimal extraabdominal metastatic disease and who&#xD;
        have symptoms exclusively referable to advanced intraabdominal malignancy will be&#xD;
        considered for the study. Specifically, patients with gastric cancer and bulky N-2 lymph&#xD;
        node involvement or patients with other primaries and who have malignant ascites or&#xD;
        peritoneal seeding would be considered optimal candidates. If all gross peritoneal disease&#xD;
        is resected (i.e., gross omental implants removed by gastrectomy), patients are still&#xD;
        eligible for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered from any toxicity from all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
        or radiotherapy (30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have any significant systemic illness (e.g., infection, cardiovascular,&#xD;
        or pulmonary) which would preclude them from being an operative candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        patients must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance status should be ECOG level 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate renal function (i.e., serum creatinine less than or equal to&#xD;
        2.0 or creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 45 ml/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be HIV negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of child bearing age must not be pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with prior CDDP will be eligible if there is no evidence of existing irreversible&#xD;
        CDDP toxicity. Patients suspected of having chronic CDDP toxicity will be further evaluated&#xD;
        as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may have mild elevations (less than 2.0 times normal) in liver function test if&#xD;
        the abnormalities are consistent with advanced intra-abdominal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Abnormalities (greater than 1 sec over normal) in PT or PTT or severe thrombocytopenia&#xD;
        (less than 75 K) will render patients ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A low Hgb secondary to chronic tumor-related, blood loss is acceptable if the patient is&#xD;
        willing and able to have transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be ineligible if the WBC is less than 3,000.&#xD;
