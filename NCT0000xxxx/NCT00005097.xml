      RATIONALE: Green tea extract contains ingredients that may inhibit the growth of actinic&#xD;
      keratosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of green tea extract in&#xD;
      treating patients who have actinic keratosis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of the green tea extract epigallocatechin gallate&#xD;
      (Polyphenon E topical ointment) in causing complete clinical and histopathologic regression&#xD;
      in patients with actinic keratoses. II. Determine duration of treatment with Polyphenon E&#xD;
      necessary to cause regression in these patients. III. Describe pathophysiologic and molecular&#xD;
      alterations in actinic keratoses and sun damaged skin that are not present in skin that is&#xD;
      not sun damaged in these patients. IV. Determine the effects of this treatment on biomarkers&#xD;
      for skin cancer in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. One of the patient's&#xD;
      arms is randomized to receive topical epigallocatechin gallate (Polyphenon E), the other arm&#xD;
      to receive a placebo. Patients receive topical applications daily for 12 weeks, or until&#xD;
      resolution of all actinic keratoses within the treatment field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 60 patients will be accrued for this study over 10 months.&#xD;

    <description>Each subject will receive both the Polyphenon E and placebo, one on each arm.&#xD;
One arm will be assigned to be treated with topical Polyphenon E daily for 12 weeks and the other with placebo vehicle in a random, double blind manner daily for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Areas of sun damaged skin with actinic keratoses to be treated will be mapped and photographed on patient's bilateral arms. One of the patient's arms will be assigned to be treated with topical Polyphenon E, the patient's other arm with placebo vehicle in a random, double blind manner. The patient's arm treatment areas will receive daily applications of a premeasured amount of drug or placebo. Patients will be seen every other week for 12 weeks to check for effects of the applications and monitor for compliance or possible side effects.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. participants multiple sites of actinic keratosis identified by clinical examination&#xD;
             and the histologic confirmation of one lesion (Grade 1-3 as defined previously in&#xD;
             &quot;Clinical Grading&quot;) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No history of invasive cancer within 5 years (though non-melanoma skin cancer, stage I&#xD;
             cervical cancer, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) stage 0 will not be reason to&#xD;
             exclude a patient); no severe metabolic disorders or other life-threatening acute or&#xD;
             chronic disease; no additional x-ray or chemotherapy anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Not requiring use of topical medications in areas being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (0= fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction&#xD;
             [Karnofsky scale 90 - 100]; 1 = restricted in physically strenuous activity, but&#xD;

             etc. will not be criteria for exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of any investigational drug in the previous 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any history of keloid formation.&#xD;
