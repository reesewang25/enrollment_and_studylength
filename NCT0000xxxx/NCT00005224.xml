      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although coronary heart disease is a major factor in morbidity and mortality in both sexes,&#xD;
      most studies prior to 1988 when the study was initiated focused on men and overlooked the&#xD;
      magnitude of the problem in women. Coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity rates are&#xD;
      higher in men than in women, accounting for 41 percent of the sex difference in overall&#xD;
      mortality in the United States. Women's advantage, however, does not seem to be stable over&#xD;
      time nor universal. For example, in 1920, the age adjusted ratio of male to female coronary&#xD;
      heart disease deaths was approximately equal, but between 1975 and 1978, it has increased to&#xD;
      a level of 2.47 in the United States. Also, sex mortality ratios for heart disease differ&#xD;
      widely across countries ranging from 5/1 in Finland to 1.87/1 in Yugoslavia. Thus, relying on&#xD;
      biological differences alone when explaining this sex differential is not convincing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on Framingham data, among the most important risk factors predicting coronary heart&#xD;
      disease in both women and men are--aside from age--cholesterol, cigarette smoking, and blood&#xD;
      pressure. Consistent with the observation that men are more likely to fall victim to coronary&#xD;
      heart disease than women is the fact that they also exhibit higher levels of these risk&#xD;
      factors when compared to women, at least up to the age of 45. Standardization of risk factor&#xD;
      levels and controlling for both levels of risk factors on coronary heart disease&#xD;
      probabilities eliminated the sex differential in 45 to 54 year olds of the Framingham Study.&#xD;
      However, among the 55 to 74 year olds, the sex differential was not due to differences in&#xD;
      levels or impact of the risk factors. It was conceivable that the sex mortality differential&#xD;
      at the older ages was due to the sex differential in primary coronary risk factors at the&#xD;
      younger ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of particular interest was the fact that the primary risk factors appeared to be influenced&#xD;
      by behavior. It was possible that gender differences in behavior might explain gender&#xD;
      differences in primary coronary risk factors. Alternatively, there was some evidence that the&#xD;
      primary coronary risk factors were not solely responsible for the etiology of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. Gender differences in psychosocial variables, such as Type A behavior, hostility,&#xD;
      and occupational stress that might play independent roles in the etiology of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease had not been systematically investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender differences in primary risk factors were determined, with all analyses being&#xD;
      controlled for body mass since men score higher on body mass index than women and body mass&#xD;
      is related to levels of primary coronary risk factors. One-way analyses of covariance were&#xD;
      performed for plasma lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, and heart rate. Gender&#xD;
      differences in psychosocial variables associated with coronary risk were investigated.&#xD;
      Analyses were performed on primary coronary risk factors at baseline in order to investigate&#xD;
      the relationships of occupational characteristics such as demand and control with age and&#xD;
      body mass index. Covariance analyses were performed for Type A/Type B by high and low&#xD;
      occupational control and by high and low demand for each sex. The role of parental history of&#xD;
      heart disease, Type A behavior and smoking in elevated primary coronary risk factors among&#xD;
      oral contraceptive users were also investigated.&#xD;
