      To observe the early course of congenital esotropia, a form of childhood strabismus. This&#xD;
      will determine the probability of spontaneous resolution. Researchers then will try to&#xD;
      correlate this finding with various aspects of the esotropia such as the (1) size of the&#xD;
      esotropia, (2) variability, and (3) presence of hyperopia. This information will be used to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial to assess the benefit of early&#xD;
      surgery for congenital esotropia and, if feasible, to refine eligibility criteria for the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congenital esotropia is the most common form of childhood strabismus. Despite its common&#xD;
      occurrence, limited information is available about its early clinical course. Such data are&#xD;
      needed to determine the earliest age at which surgery can be safely performed without concern&#xD;
      that the esotropia is likely to resolve spontaneously. Although the term congenital esotropia&#xD;
      implies that the esotropia is present at birth, in many cases the esotropia actually develops&#xD;
      sometime during the first few months of life. It is well recognized that congenital esotropia&#xD;
      persisting through 6 months of age rarely if ever resolves spontaneously and therefore&#xD;
      requires surgical correction. However, it is not clear how often congenital esotropia occurs&#xD;
      and then resolves (at an earlier age such that surgery is not necessary) before surgery is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical practice is to defer surgery for congenital esotropia until 6 to 12 months&#xD;
      of age. Assuming that characteristics of congenital esotropia at 2 to 4 months of age can be&#xD;
      identified to predict which cases will require surgery, then a trial will be warranted to&#xD;
      determine whether performing earlier surgery enhances the development of binocular vision.&#xD;
      The potential benefit to very early surgery is supported by neurophysiologic research, which&#xD;
      has shown that (1) congenital esotropes may be born with the innate ability to develop&#xD;
      binocular vision, (2) there is a critical period for development of normal binocular function&#xD;
      within the first few months of life that is dependent on alignment of the visual axes of the&#xD;
      two eyes, and (3) ocular misalignment alone, regardless of its mechanism, without a&#xD;
      coexisting primary cortical fusion deficit, can account for abnormal development of binocular&#xD;
      vision. Clinical reports have demonstrated that surgical correction of the esotropia between&#xD;
      6 and 12 months of age provides for enhanced development of stereoacuity compared with later&#xD;
      surgery. However, there are limited data on the outcomes in infants who had surgical&#xD;
      correction before age 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for the study is identical to usual clinical practice. Following informed&#xD;
      consent, two followup visits are conducted: one 2 to 4 weeks after the first examination and&#xD;
      the other when the child is between 28 and 32 weeks of age. The examinations will be&#xD;
      identical to the pediatric ophthalmologist's usual routine, and no additional procedures are&#xD;
      being performed specifically for the study. Management of refractive error and amblyopia is&#xD;
      left to the ophthalmologist's discretion. A sample size of 150 has been projected for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
