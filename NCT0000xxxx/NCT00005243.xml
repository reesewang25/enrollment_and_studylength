      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classic studies of daily activity prior to myocardial infarction onset conducted by&#xD;
      Master in the 1960s failed to show a consistent relationship between any particular activity&#xD;
      and disease onset. However, they were conducted at a time when less was known of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of myocardial infarction, when there was less understanding of the effect of&#xD;
      daily activities on physiologic processes likely to lead to myocardial infarction onset, and&#xD;
      when epidemiologic methods were less well developed than at present. Certain activities now&#xD;
      of considerable interest, such as wake time, time of assuming the upright posture, eating and&#xD;
      taking of medications, were not examined and those that were examined such as walking and&#xD;
      heavy exertion, were evaluated without reference to control exposure. In addition, modern&#xD;
      enzymatic methods of confirmation of the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction were not&#xD;
      utilized. Despite these deficiencies, the studies of Master provide the foundation for the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the onset of myocardial infarction is almost always a random event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations of morning increase in the incidence of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death, and myocardial ischemia demonstrate that the timing of these events is not wholly&#xD;
      random. The most extensive data on the time of onset of the pain of myocardial infarction&#xD;
      were published in 1976 by the World Health Organization in the report of the Myocardial&#xD;
      Infarction Community Registers from 19 European centers. Data from over 8,900 patients&#xD;
      clearly demonstrated a peak incidence of onset of pain from 8 to 11 a.m. Data from the&#xD;
      Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size (MILIS) Study revealed a&#xD;
      significant circadian variation with an increased incidence of myocardial infarction in the&#xD;
      period from 6 a.m to noon. The morning increase was detected despite the fact that data&#xD;
      concerning the time of awakening and prior medication usage were lacking in this patient&#xD;
      population. This finding has been confirmed by Willich in a study of over 1,700 patients with&#xD;
      infarct onset determined by creatine kinase timing. The patients showed a four-fold increased&#xD;
      morning onset of myocardial infarction relative to occurrence at night. When the relationship&#xD;
      of infarction onset to time of awakening is clarified, and possible precipitants evaluated,&#xD;
      increased information about triggering processes will be available. Such information will&#xD;
      assist in the design of preventive therapy which can be evaluated in randomized trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Determinants Study began in 1989, shortly after widespread acceptance of the circadian&#xD;
      variation in Ml occurrence. The study was initiated to utilize state-of-the art epidemiologic&#xD;
      techniques to determine the role of daily activities in the triggering of Ml. The&#xD;
      investigators created a new epidemiologic technique (the case-crossover method), developed&#xD;
      and tested a 24-page interview form, established a large study group of hospitals with&#xD;
      trained interviewers, instituted quality control measures, and enrolled over 2,000 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Triggers of Ventricular Arrhythmias (TOVA) Study began in FY 1999 under the same grant&#xD;
      number as the Modifiers and Determinants Studies. The TOVA study investigates factors&#xD;
      associated with triggering of discharge of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Myocardial Infarction Onset Study (Determinants Study) supported from 1989 to 1993 had a&#xD;
      case-control design. Coronary care units in the Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts areas&#xD;
      collaborated. Eligible patients were interviewed concerning: whether the myocardial&#xD;
      infarction was the first or not and the nature and timing of pain; the time of waking the day&#xD;
      of onset of the infarction and the time of assuming upright posture; the number of times the&#xD;
      patient awoke from sleep and assumed the upright posture during the night or day prior to&#xD;
      myocardial infarction; whether the patient was receiving therapy with a beta-blocker or&#xD;
      aspirin and at what time the medication was taken in the 24 hours preceding the myocardial&#xD;
      infarction; and age and smoking status. A questionnaire was administered on: educational&#xD;
      background; marital status; occupation; usual activity in recent past and, specifically, on&#xD;
      the day before onset including diet, coffee consumption, smoking, and exercise; sleep habits;&#xD;
      geographic location where the infarct occurred. Data were also abstracted from the medical&#xD;
      record. Patient enrollment ended in the fourth year. Relative risks associated with&#xD;
      hypothesized risk factors for onset of myocardial infarction were estimated by comparing&#xD;
      observed exposure frequencies immediately prior to myocardial infarction with expected values&#xD;
      derived from exposure frequencies in the same patients at other times of the day and in other&#xD;
      patients at the same time of day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grant was renewed in 1994 through November 1998 to conduct a new study entitled Modifiers&#xD;
      of Myocardial Infarction Onset (Modifiers Study) . The Modifiers Study elucidated the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction (Ml) onset and utilized the methodologic&#xD;
      techniques, 50-hospital national study group, and findings of the completed NHLBl-funded&#xD;
      Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study (Determinants Study). The Modifiers Study&#xD;
      identified factors that increased or decreased the susceptibility of patients to the triggers&#xD;
      of acute Ml previously identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was hoped that the Modifiers Study would answer the major questions raised by the results&#xD;
      of the Determinants Study. It tested hypotheses concerning five groups of factors that were&#xD;
      potential modifiers of susceptibility to the triggering of acute MI: l) Pharmacologic means&#xD;
      of Prevention - that beta blockers, aspirin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and&#xD;
      estrogen use decrease susceptibility to triggers; 2) Timing - that susceptibility does not&#xD;
      increase in the morning but does in the winter, and that exogenous rather than endogenous&#xD;
      daily rhythms determine onset; 3) Traditional chronic risk factors - that diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, and smoking increase susceptibility and that regular exercise decreases&#xD;
      susceptibility (to triggers other than exertion); 4) Gender - that women are less susceptible&#xD;
      to triggering; and 5) Dietary factors - that chronic moderate alcohol use and anti-oxidants&#xD;
      decrease susceptibility. To test the hypotheses, 5,700 interviews were needed. By the&#xD;
      completion of the Determinants Study in March 1993, over 2,000 interviews were completed. It&#xD;
      was estimated that continuation in the Modifiers Study of the 77 interviews per month would&#xD;
      provide the required 3,700 additional interviews by December 1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOVA was begun in FY 1999 to identify activities (such as heavy exertion) that trigger ICD&#xD;
      discharge, assess factors (such as beta-blockade) that modify the susceptibility to&#xD;
      triggering, determine if ICD discharges occurred more frequently in certain periods (i.e.,&#xD;
      the 3 hours after awakening, on Monday, and in winter), and utilize electrograms recorded&#xD;
      prior to ICD discharge to identify sympathetic activation during triggering. TOVA used a&#xD;
      cohort design with a nested case-crossover analysis. TOVA characterized triggering in&#xD;
      episodes of ICD discharge in 1,140 patients treated in 31 centers nationwide over four years.&#xD;
