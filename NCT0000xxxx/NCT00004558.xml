      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are common causes of the&#xD;
      300,000 sudden deaths occurring in the United States each year. Most of these victims have&#xD;
      associated heart disease, most commonly coronary artery disease. Populations consuming&#xD;
      considerable quantities of fish and marine mammals have lower than expected mortality rates&#xD;
      from coronary disease. Interventional and observational trials have indicated that fatty fish&#xD;
      consumption decreases the death rate from coronary artery disease, in part by reducing the&#xD;
      number of sudden deaths. Animal and tissue culture studies both support the hypothesis that&#xD;
      these beneficial effects are from the antiarrhythmic properties of n-3 long chained&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, double blinded trial. Survivors of VT and VF with an implantable&#xD;
      defibrillator were randomized, 100 to dietary supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids(PUFA) or 100 to a placebo. Adherence to the supplement were assessed by measurements of&#xD;
      plasma, red cell, and adipose tissue n-3 fatty acid concentrations. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variable was the incidence of recurrent VT or VF, but secondary variables were also assessed&#xD;
      using serial implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) assessment, correlation of the&#xD;
      rhythms with the biochemical measurements of n-3 fatty acids, hospitalization rates and&#xD;
      quality of life. The (ICD) was the best protection available to patients and stored rhythm&#xD;
      electrograms which allowed documentation of rhythm endpoints.&#xD;
