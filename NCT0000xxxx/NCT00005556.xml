      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As bone marrow transplantation becomes one of the preferred treatments for life-threatening&#xD;
      diseases of the blood, increasing numbers of patients must seek compatible marrow from&#xD;
      unrelated donors. The low probability of finding a good patient-donor marrow match means that&#xD;
      between one- to two-thirds of ill patients never locate a donor with perfectly compatible&#xD;
      marrow. Furthermore, once volunteers are identified as a preliminary match for a patient, 30&#xD;
      to 40 percent are either unwilling or medically unable to actually donate marrow. Thus,&#xD;
      volunteer attrition contributes significantly to the problems already inherent in finding a&#xD;
      suitable donor candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examined the relationship of volunteer characteristics and donor center factors to&#xD;
      volunteer psychological outcomes during two critical stages in the blood testing process and&#xD;
      to donor center rates of volunteer cooperation at these stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal and cross-sectional survey data were gathered from a total of over 2,900&#xD;
      potential marrow donors who were at one of two critical decision points in the process&#xD;
      leading to donation (DR-blood-typing, CT-blood-typing), and from personnel at the 100 NMDP&#xD;
      donor centers. These data allowed the investigators to (a) describe the distribution and&#xD;
      interrelationships between donor center structural characteristics and the strategies centers&#xD;
      utilize for volunteer recruitment and retention, (b) determine which donor center factors&#xD;
      (both structural and tactical) and volunteer background characteristics best predict positive&#xD;
      volunteer-specific psychological outcomes at later typing stages, and examine and revise&#xD;
      models of individual volunteer-specific outcomes and aggregate across-center retention rates.&#xD;
