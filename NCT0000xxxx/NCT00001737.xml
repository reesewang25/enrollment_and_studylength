  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a sustained-release cyclosporin&#xD;
      implant to treat uveitis, a sight-threatening eye inflammation caused by an immune system&#xD;
      abnormality. Previous studies in humans have shown that, taken by mouth, the drug cyclosporin&#xD;
      is effective in treating chronic uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uveitis may require long-term treatment with potent immune-suppressing drugs, such as&#xD;
      cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine or steroids. Taken systemically (by&#xD;
      mouth or injection), however, these drugs can do serious damage to the kidneys, liver or&#xD;
      lungs, and can raise blood pressure and lower blood cell counts. Because of this, some&#xD;
      patients cannot or will not use these medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This small pilot study will evaluate the safety, and to some extent effectiveness, of&#xD;
      cyclosporin delivered directly into the eye, to try to prevent harmful side effects. In&#xD;
      animal studies, sustained-release cyclosporin implants did not cause the severe side effects&#xD;
      seen with systemic use of the drug. Some animals developed opacity of the lens and slowed&#xD;
      retinal responses, both of which reversed when the drug was stopped. Earlier animal studies&#xD;
      of cyclosporin injected directly into the eye reduced inflammation that had been produced&#xD;
      experimentally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with uveitis who have active inflammation and poor vision are eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.&#xD;
      One group will receive a 1-mg implant that releases 0.8 micrograms of drug each day; the&#xD;
      second group will receive a 2-mg implant that delivers 1.4 micrograms of drug a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, patients will have a medical history, basic physical examination, and&#xD;
      complete eye examination, including special tests called electroretinogram and fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography. An electroretinogram measures the electrical responses generated in the retina&#xD;
      in the back of the eye. Fluorescein angiography uses a special camera to photograph the&#xD;
      retina, showing the condition of the blood vessels in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure to place the implant takes about 1.5 hours and may be done under&#xD;
      either local or general anesthesia. Patients will stay in the hospital overnight. After&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital, they will return for follow-up visits 1 and 2 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery, then once a month for 6 months, and then every 3 months until the implant is&#xD;
      depleted of drug or removed. During these follow-up visits, eye examinations will be repeated&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of the implant on the eye. Repeat blood tests will measure the amount&#xD;
      of cyclosporin in the blood and the drug's effect on the kidneys. When the implant runs out&#xD;
      of drug (between 2 and 3 years), it may be removed or left in place.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sight threatening uveitis may require long term use of systemic immunosuppressants. In some&#xD;
      patients, aggressive systemic immunosuppressive therapy fails to control inflammation and can&#xD;
      lead to serious side effects. Oral Cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown in several human trials&#xD;
      to be effective in treating chronic uveitis. This pilot study will assess the safety, and to&#xD;
      some extent efficacy, of a novel intraocular CsA release implant in patients with active&#xD;
      inflammation and poor visual acuity in one eye despite immunosuppressant therapy. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive in one eye a 1 or 2 mg CsA implant releasing at either&#xD;
      0.8 microgram per day or 1.4 microgram per day respectively. The main purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to assess the safety of the CsA implant. Secondary outcomes will include a change from&#xD;
      baseline in the ocular inflammation, visual acuity, and the need for concomitant&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age range: 15 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active non-infectious intermediate, posterior or panuveitis present for at least 6 months&#xD;
        despite systemic immunosupressive therapy including at least 20 mg of oral prednisone or&#xD;
        use of another immunosuppressive agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Visual acuity worse than 20/80 (55 letters) and better than 5/200 (4 letters) in the eye to&#xD;
        receive the CsA implant, and better than 20/80 (54 letters) in the non-study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bilateral or unilateral uveitis with active inflammation in one eye only (eye to be&#xD;
        implanted). Patients may continue systemic immunosuppressants with the exception of&#xD;
        systemic CsA. Patients may not take greater than 1 drop of topical steroid four times a day&#xD;
        in the eye to be implanted for maintenance of anterior segment inflammation after 1 month&#xD;
        postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recordable electroretinogram (ERG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness and the ability, with assistance of a care giver, if necessary, to comply with&#xD;
        treatment and follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The ability to understand and sign an informed consent form which must be obtained prior to&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Negative serum pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal serum creatinine (males 0.9 - 1.4 mg/dL, females 0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No current or past history of retinal detachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current or past history of retinal detachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or lactating patients or patients with potential for conception unless using&#xD;
        effective contraception. Fertile males must use effective contraception. Contraception&#xD;
        would no longer be mandatory for participation in this study at three months&#xD;
        postoperatively assuming (1) negligible CsA absorption, (2) patient is not taking any other&#xD;
        medications that may affect a developing fetus or spermatogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who received therapy within the previous one week with any nephrotoxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients having a known allergy to CsA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients receiving current therapy with CsA. Patients need to be off of systemic CsA seven&#xD;
        days prior to implant surgery. Patients may continue other immunosuppressive therapies if&#xD;
        needed to control inflammation in contralateral (non-study) eye provided the inflammation&#xD;
        is currently not active.&#xD;
