  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaging studies of the brain have revealed the different areas involved in the processes of&#xD;
      learning and reasoning. However, the specific role these regions play in these processes, or&#xD;
      if stimulating these areas can improve these processes is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers would like to use repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) to better understand&#xD;
      the roles of individual brain regions on the processes of learning and reasoning. Repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the placement of a cooled electromagnet&#xD;
      with a figure-eight coil on the patient's scalp, and rapidly turning on and off the magnetic&#xD;
      flux. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of the surface of the brain&#xD;
      (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation varies, depending upon the location,&#xD;
      intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use rTMS to help determine the roles of different brain&#xD;
      regions in the development of implicit learning of motor sequences and analogic reasoning. In&#xD;
      addition, researchers hope to evaluate if stimulation of these regions speeds up the process&#xD;
      of learning or analogic reasoning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The human frontal cortex subserves a number of psychological processes including those&#xD;
      necessary for adequate implicit learning of visuomotor sequences and analogical reasoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implicit learning is a form of procedural learning indicated by behavioral improvement&#xD;
           without awareness of a repeated stimulus structure that leads to improved performance.&#xD;
           This type of learning has been associated with activation of the primary motor cortex&#xD;
           (M1) in neuroimaging studies. While neuroimaging studies contributed to identify this&#xD;
           region, they do not provide information about its relative role in the process of&#xD;
           implicit learning. Is activity in this region necessary for implicit learning to occur?&#xD;
           Is it possible that &quot;energizing&quot; this region using subthreshold transcranial magnetic&#xD;
           stimulation can accelerate the implicit phase of learning? The purpose of this protocol&#xD;
           is to transiently stimulate focally M1 and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during&#xD;
           acquisition of implicit learning and evaluate the effects on reaction times and accuracy&#xD;
           of performance. We plan to study a group of normal volunteers, and three groups of&#xD;
           patients who demonstrate impaired visuomotor procedural learning tasks: those with&#xD;
           Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease, and focal frontal lesions. The result expected&#xD;
           from this study is an advanced understanding of the role that the motor cortex and&#xD;
           dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays in implicit learning in health and disease.&#xD;
           Additionally, we expect to be able to shorten the implicit phase of learning by rTMS&#xD;
           particularly in the patient groups that exhibit abnormal procedural learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analogical reasoning requires that subjects adequately process different forms of&#xD;
           information and then perform a mapping process that allows them to recognize the&#xD;
           similarity between two or more forms of information. Evidence has been provided that&#xD;
           indicates this process of analogical mapping is subserved by the frontal cortex. We plan&#xD;
           to study a group of normal volunteers, and three groups of patients who demonstrate&#xD;
           impaired performance on tests of analogical reasoning and problem-solving: those with&#xD;
           Parkinson's disease, frontal lobe dementia, and focal frontal lesions. We predict that&#xD;
           subthreshold rTMS will facilitate analogical reasoning by promoting the activation of&#xD;
           established or novel neural activation patterns that represents the actual mapping and&#xD;
           decision processes required for analogical reasoning. Additionally, we expect to&#xD;
           facilitate response times and accuracy in analogical mapping in those patients that&#xD;
           exhibit abnormal analogical reasoning performance.&#xD;
