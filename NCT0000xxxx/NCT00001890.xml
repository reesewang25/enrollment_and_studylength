  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and heart disease are much more common in men&#xD;
      than in women. However, as women grow older, especially after menopause the incidence of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and heart disease increases. These findings suggest that estrogen may be&#xD;
      protective and help in preventing heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of large groups of post-menopausal women suggest that hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      (therapy that includes estrogen) reduces the risk of heart disease. Estrogen causes favorable&#xD;
      changes in particles that carry cholesterol in the blood stream and improves function of&#xD;
      blood vessels. Estrogen may also stimulate the immune system's ability to fight off&#xD;
      infections that may lead to or contribute to atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe two specific infectious agents (Chlamydia pneumoniae and human&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus) may cause damage to the lining of blood vessels resulting in inflammation&#xD;
      and the development of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if estrogen treatment can change how the immune&#xD;
      system responds to chronic infections, by Chlamydia pneumoniae and human cytomegalovirus, in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in women does not approach rates seen&#xD;
      in men until approximately a decade following menopause, suggesting that estrogen is&#xD;
      vasculoprotective. Infectious pathogens such a Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) and human&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (hCMV) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
      Experimental studies in cultured lymphocytes and animals suggest that estrogen stimulates&#xD;
      cell-mediated immune responsiveness, observations that are potentially relevant to the&#xD;
      eradication of intracellular pathogens including C. pneumoniae and hCMV. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether estrogen therapy augments cell-mediated immune responsiveness&#xD;
      in estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women who have serologic evidence of chronic infection&#xD;
      with C. pneumoniae and/or hCMV. A comparison will be made between seropositive and&#xD;
      seronegative women. We propose that estrogen therapy will stimulate a more efficient&#xD;
      cell-mediated response to these chronically persistent infectious intracellular pathogens,&#xD;
      resulting in eradication of these organisms that are of potential importance in&#xD;
      atherogenesis.&#xD;
