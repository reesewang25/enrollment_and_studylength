      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing&#xD;
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. Bone&#xD;
      marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of&#xD;
      chemotherapy to kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving high-dose chemotherapy followed by bone&#xD;
      marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation to see how well it works in treating patients&#xD;
      with refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of intensive carmustine and etoposide with&#xD;
      cisplatin or cyclophosphamide, followed by rescue with autologous bone marrow (ABM) treated&#xD;
      in vitro with etoposide and/or peripheral blood stem cells mobilized with filgrastim (G-CSF)&#xD;
      or sargramostim (GM-CSF) with or without radiotherapy in patients with refractory Hodgkin's&#xD;
      disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the time to recovery of peripheral blood&#xD;
      counts in patients treated with this regimen. III. Correlate the rate of peripheral blood&#xD;
      cell recovery in these patients with in vitro growth of ABM treated with etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Autologous bone marrow (ABM) is harvested and&#xD;
      two-thirds of the ABM is treated in vitro with etoposide (VP-16). ABM may have been stored&#xD;
      earlier in the course of the disease for patients who are at high risk of relapse or who were&#xD;
      previously treated with agents causing bone marrow or stem cell damage (e.g., nitrosoureas,&#xD;
      pelvic irradiation). Patients with prior bone marrow involvement and subsequent bone marrow&#xD;
      remission must have received 1 or 2 additional courses of the same chemotherapy before&#xD;
      undergoing harvest of ABM. Patients for whom PBSC rescue alone is planned also undergo ABM&#xD;
      harvest in case back-up ABM rescue is needed. Patients then receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) or&#xD;
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning 5 days before harvest of peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cells (PBSC) and continuing until completion of harvest. Patients without extensive prior&#xD;
      radiotherapy undergo radiotherapy to areas of measurable active disease plus a 2 cm margin on&#xD;
      days -21 to -17 and -14 to -8. Patients without a contraindication to cisplatin (e.g.,&#xD;
      hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy) receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours on days -7 to -3&#xD;
      and carmustine IV over 2 hours and VP-16 IV over 4 hours on days -6 to -4. Patients with a&#xD;
      contraindication to cisplatin receive cyclophosphamide IV every 12 hours, VP-16 IV over 1&#xD;
      hour every 12 hours, and carmustine IV over 1 hour on days -7 to -4. ABM and/or PBSC are&#xD;
      reinfused on day 0. The first 6 ABM rescue patients receive untreated ABM and subsequent&#xD;
      patients receive ABM treated in vitro with VP-16. Patients with bone marrow biopsy showing no&#xD;
      evidence of regeneration (marrow cellularity less than 1%) at day 21 after PBSC rescue&#xD;
      undergo back-up ABM rescue. Patients without engraftment (granulocyte count less than 500/mm3&#xD;
      and untransfused platelets no greater than 20,000/mm3) by day 28 after rescue with ABM&#xD;
      treated in vitro with VP-16 undergo rescue with untreated ABM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-46 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
