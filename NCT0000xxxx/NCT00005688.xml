  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the differential diagnosis and longitudinal course of medical outpatients&#xD;
      complaining of palpitations. Also, to further examine the process of cardiac perception, the&#xD;
      psychological factors which influence it, and the accurate awareness of cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred seventy-five consecutive patients referred for continuous ambulatory&#xD;
      electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring because of palpitations were studied. The&#xD;
      investigators assessed cardiac symptoms, psychiatric diagnosis, life stress, beliefs about&#xD;
      heart disease, somatization, and bodily absorption and amplification. Cardiac awareness,&#xD;
      cardiac symptoms and cardiac activity were assessed during Holter monitoring and exercise&#xD;
      tolerance testing (ETT). The referring physicians completed instruments rating their&#xD;
      diagnostic impressions and clinical interventions. The patients' clinical course was then&#xD;
      followed over the ensuing 12 months with telephone interviews and in-person assessments.&#xD;
      These data permitted description and distinguished three subgroups of palpitation patients:&#xD;
      those with panic disorder, in whom the symptom resulted from sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      arousal; those who were somatizing after a life event caused them to suspect that they had&#xD;
      heart disease, in whom the palpitation resulted from a cognitive misattribution of benign&#xD;
      bodily sensation; and those with clinically significant arrhythmias, whose symptoms resulted&#xD;
      from a major cardiac irregularity. These findings were used to develop a clinical algorithm&#xD;
      to aid in the differential diagnosis of palpitations and in identifying the patients most&#xD;
      appropriate for Holter monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' longitudinal course was followed to determine the predictors of continued&#xD;
      somatization and chronicity, and to study their medical care by examining the referring&#xD;
      physicians' diagnostic impressions and interventions. By comparing cardiac symptoms with&#xD;
      concurrent cardiac activity during Holter monitoring and ETT, the investigators hoped to&#xD;
      develop measures of cardiac awareness. They would then be able to describe inter-individual&#xD;
      differences in cardiac awareness, examine several psychological factors which amplify or&#xD;
      modulate awareness, and investigate the relationship between somatization and accuracy of&#xD;
      symptom reporting. It was hoped that the findings would ultimately lead to improved cognitive&#xD;
      and educational techniques to reassure and palliate palpitation patients, and to the early&#xD;
      identification of patients who were unlikely to obtain symptomatic relief from antiarrhythmic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
