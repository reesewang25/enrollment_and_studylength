  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unresectable primary or metastatic cancer confined to the liver will undergo a&#xD;
      1 hour hyperthermic isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) via the portal vein and hepatic artery&#xD;
      with escalating dose melphalan. Patients eligible for this protocol are those with&#xD;
      non-colorectal histologies and those with colorectal cancer previously treated with&#xD;
      intra-arterial FUDR. Hepatic and systemic toxicity, response to treatment, duration of&#xD;
      response, and survival will be followed.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Histologically or cytologically proven measurable primary or metastatic non-colorectal&#xD;
        cancer limited to the parenchyma of the liver with no evidence of unresectable extrahepatic&#xD;
        disease by preoperative radiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Limited resectable extrahepatic disease is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with colorectal cancer previously treated with intrahepatic arterial infusional&#xD;
        therapy using FUDR, those with aberrant arterial anatomy such that infusional therapy is&#xD;
        not possible, or those with limited extrahepatic disease such that regional therapy is not&#xD;
        indicated will be eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have had no chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy for their&#xD;
        malignancy in the month prior to the liver perfusion and must have recovered from all side&#xD;
        effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have an ECOG performance standard of 0, 1 or 2 on the day prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidence by bilirubin less than 2.0 and a&#xD;
        PT and PTT that are within 1-2 seconds of the upper normal limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with biopsy proven cirrhosis or evidence of significant portal hypertension by&#xD;
        history, endoscopy, or radiologic studies will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with a history of congestive heart failure with an LVEF of equal to or less&#xD;
        than 40% will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with COPD or other chronic pulmonary disease with PFT's less than 50% predicted&#xD;
        for age will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100,000, a HCT greater than 27.0, a white&#xD;
        blood count greater than 3000/ micrograms, and a creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 or a&#xD;
        creatinine clearance of greater than 60 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnant patients or nursing mothers will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not be taking immunosuppressive drugs or on chronic anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have an active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with severe allergic reactions to iodine contrast which can not be controlled by&#xD;
        premedication with antihistamines and steroids are not eligible as a hepatic angiogram is&#xD;
        needed for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have HIV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her illness, the experimental nature&#xD;
        of the therapy, alternative treatments, potential benefits, and risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must be willing to sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have a history of veno occlusive disease.&#xD;
