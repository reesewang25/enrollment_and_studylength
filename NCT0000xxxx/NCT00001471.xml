  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine tissue from the tonsils, lymph nodes and large bowel of HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients to investigate changes in viral load and certain white blood cells during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and HIV-infected patients 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests and possibly an electrocardiogram (EKG). Blood tests may include HLA typing, a&#xD;
      genetic test of immune system markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (patients and volunteers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies The frequency of biopsies for given patients may vary, depending on their&#xD;
           specific therapy. Typically, biopsies are done at a single time, or for patients&#xD;
           starting a new therapy, biopsies could be performed before starting therapy, during&#xD;
           therapy and possibly after completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tonsil biopsies (patients and volunteers) Volunteers will have one tonsil biopsy.&#xD;
           Patients will have no more than six tonsil biopsies, with no more than three in a 10-day&#xD;
           period. The biopsy is done by an ear, nose and throat specialist as an outpatient&#xD;
           procedure. The tonsils are numbed with a local anesthetic, and one to four pieces of&#xD;
           tissue are extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph node biopsies (patients only) Patients will have no more than four lymph node&#xD;
           biopsies, performed no more frequently than once a month. The biopsy is done by a&#xD;
           surgeon and may require a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. The skin above the lymph nodes is&#xD;
           numbed with a local anesthetic, an incision is made and the tissue is removed.&#xD;
           Alternatively, a needle biopsy may be done, in which a small amount of lymph tissue is&#xD;
           withdrawn through a special needle injected into the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intestinal biopsies (patients and volunteers) Volunteers will have one intestinal biopsy&#xD;
           procedure. Patients may have up to six intestinal biopsy procedures, each separated by&#xD;
           at least 10 days. This is done by a gastroenterologist as an outpatient procedure. A&#xD;
           flexible tube (sigmoidoscope or colonoscope) with a light and special lens at the tip is&#xD;
           inserted into the rectum and large bowel. Wire instruments passed through the tube are&#xD;
           used to extract small tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; patients and volunteers) Volunteers and patients will&#xD;
           undergo bronchoscopy in which a flexible tube (bronchoscope) with a light and special&#xD;
           lens at the tip is inserted through the nose or mouth into the lungs, and the lining of&#xD;
           the lung is sampled by washing the airways with small amounts of saline. The procedure&#xD;
           is performed by a pulmonologist or critical care specialist, usually as an outpatient.&#xD;

      Examining tissues outside the bloodstream in HIV-infected patients, patients with Idiopathic&#xD;
      CD4 lymphopenia (ICL) and, for comparison, HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers (hereafter&#xD;
      referred to as healthy volunteers), can provide insights into the pathogenesis of HIV&#xD;
      infection and ICL. This protocol will provide a mechanism for sampling tissue sites. A total&#xD;
      of 430 HIV-infected patients, 100 ICL patients and 105 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in&#xD;
      these studies. To assess changes in viral load and immunological parameters at sites outside&#xD;
      the bloodstream during therapy of HIV-infected patients, sequential tonsillar, lymph node, or&#xD;
      intestinal biopsies, or bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be undertaken&#xD;
      during the course of therapy. In a small number of patients, sequential or simultaneous lymph&#xD;
      node biopsies will be performed. In addition, uninfected healthy volunteers will be enrolled&#xD;
      to have a tonsillar or intestinal biopsy, or bronchoscopy with BAL; this will allow&#xD;
      comparison of immunologic parameters in HIVinfected and uninfected tonsillar or intestinal&#xD;
      tissues, or BAL fluid. Finally, ICL patients may have tissue sampling to assess lymphocyte&#xD;
      distribution and possible function in tissues to better understand the pathogenesis of their&#xD;
      lymphopenia. Sequential or simultaneous tissue sampling may occur and longitudinal samples&#xD;
      may also be obtained to assess stability in tissue compartments or effect of possible&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatments.&#xD;
