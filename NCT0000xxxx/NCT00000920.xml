  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give saquinavir-SGC (SQV) combined with&#xD;
      low-dose ritonavir (RTV) plus zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC) to HIV-positive pregnant&#xD;
      women and to see if it is safe to give 3TC and ZDV to their newborns. Another purpose is to&#xD;
      see what levels of SQV, low-dose RTV, ZDV, and 3TC are found in mothers and what levels of&#xD;
      ZDV and 3TC are seen in newborns. Another purpose of this study is to see whether SQV passes&#xD;
      from mother to newborn and if it passes at a level that is safe for the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ZDV has been able to reduce the rate of transmission of HIV from mother to child, it&#xD;
      may be possible to reduce it further by using a combination of anti-HIV drugs. This study&#xD;
      adds SQV (a protease inhibitor [PI]) with RTV (another PI) and 3TC (a reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitor) to the mother's ZDV regimen.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although administration of ZDV to mother-infant pairs has dramatically reduced perinatal HIV&#xD;
      infection, the goal is to reduce it further to less than 2%. In order to achieve this,&#xD;
      combination strategies need to be developed for 2 purposes: 1) to reduce the perinatal&#xD;
      transmission rate to goal levels; and 2) to provide other combination therapies for&#xD;
      HIV-infected mothers whose virus has become resistant to ZDV, who have a very high viral&#xD;
      load, or who have previously transmitted HIV while on ZDV. This study adds 3TC (another&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor) and SQV (a protease inhibitor [PI]) [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      08/15/00: with low-dose RTV (another PI)] to the mother's ZDV regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the antepartum period, mothers receive SQV with [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/15/00: low-dose&#xD;
      RTV plus] ZDV and 3TC. At onset of active labor, mothers receive loading doses of each of the&#xD;
      study drugs, then receive study drugs for 12 weeks postpartum on the same schedule as during&#xD;
      the antenatal period. Within 12 hours of delivery, infants begin receiving 3TC and ZDV and&#xD;
      continue until 6 weeks of age. Mothers are followed until 12 weeks postpartum and babies are&#xD;
      followed until 6 months of age. [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/09/99: For maternal dosing, 1 Combivir&#xD;
      tablet (containing 3TC and ZDV) may be administered in place of the individual agents 3TC and&#xD;
      ZDV. Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment should continue to be followed for&#xD;
      the duration of the study.]&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are 14 to 32 weeks pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at least 13 years old (need consent of parent or guardian if under 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cannot take ZDV, 3TC, or higher doses of RTV. Women who are able to tolerate low doses&#xD;
             of RTV may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant with more than 1 baby. (This study has been changed so that a patient&#xD;
             pregnant with more than 1 baby is not eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have pregnancy complications or have medical problems that put pregnancy at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active opportunistic (HIV-related) infection and/or serious bacterial&#xD;
             infection at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have chronic diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abuse alcohol or drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do not have access to a participating clinic or are not willing to be followed at the&#xD;
             same clinic for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received certain antiretroviral (anti-HIV) drugs or are taking certain&#xD;
             medications. (This study has been changed to increase enrollment. The eligibility&#xD;
             criterion in earlier versions was more restrictive, and has been changed to include&#xD;
             women receiving SQV [with or without RTV], 3TC, and ZDV for longer than 3 weeks if&#xD;
             their pre-entry viral load is 400 copies/ml or less OR if they have a significant&#xD;
             reduction in viral load within 90 days of the pre-entry visit.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plan to breast-feed.&#xD;
