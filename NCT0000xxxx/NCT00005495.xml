      To evaluate the effectiveness of primary prevention of coronary heart disease risk factors by&#xD;
      examining data from the National Health Examination Survey (NHES) and the National Health and&#xD;
      Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) to determine whether more recent birth cohorts were&#xD;
      attaining lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels than earlier birth cohorts.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coronary heart disease risk factor profile of Americans has been improving, with&#xD;
      decreasing blood pressure and cholesterol levels. However, it is not apparent whether this&#xD;
      improvement is due to primary prevention of risk factors through lifestyle choices or to&#xD;
      secondary prevention (management) of established risk factors. Since secondary prevention&#xD;
      only targets people with high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, the effect should be&#xD;
      demonstrated by temporal declines in the upper percentiles (75th, 90th) of the blood pressure&#xD;
      and cholesterol distributions. Primary prevention should shift the entire risk factor&#xD;
      distribution, including the percentiles in the middle (50th) and lower (10th, 25th) portions&#xD;
      of the distribution. Thus, the effectiveness of primary prevention programs can be evaluated&#xD;
      by examining temporal changes in the middle and lower percentiles, and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      secondary prevention can be evaluated by examining temporal changes in the higher&#xD;
      percentiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the National Health Examination Survey and the National Health and Nutrition&#xD;
      Examination Surveys were examined to determine whether more recent birth cohorts were&#xD;
      attaining lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels than earlier birth cohorts. The results&#xD;
      of these analyses provided information that may help guide further research and application&#xD;
      of population prevention strategies.&#xD;
