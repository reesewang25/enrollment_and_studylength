      This protocol has three purposes: (1) to evaluate subjects for inclusion or exclusion from&#xD;
      other NIAAA protocols; (2) to provide a common set of descriptive information that will be&#xD;
      available on all NIAAA research subjects; (3) to allow NIAAA medical and nursing staff to&#xD;
      treat alcoholic patients for acute alcohol intoxication or alcohol withdrawal before&#xD;
      requiring patients to consent to evaluation for participation in research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information collected will include such items as psychiatric diagnoses, presence or absence&#xD;
      of brain, liver or other organ damage, history of the amount of past alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      other substance use and family history of alcoholism. This information will allow&#xD;
      investigators to determine for which, if any, NIAAA research studies a subject is eligible.&#xD;
      In order to avoid requiring intoxicated subjects to consent for procedures such as HIV&#xD;
      testing, psychiatric interviews, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain we will&#xD;
      obtain consent from all alcoholic subjects in two phases, using two separate consent forms.&#xD;
      The first consent form will express the subject's desire to be admitted to the NIAAA&#xD;
      inpatient unit for the purpose of treatment for alcoholism and will authorize only medical&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment for alcoholism and associated problems. After an alcoholic subject&#xD;
      has been admitted to the inpatient unit and is judged to be no longer intoxicated or&#xD;
      suffering from acute alcohol withdrawal he or she will be presented with the second consent&#xD;
      which will describe the evaluation for participation in other NIAAA research studies.&#xD;
      Non-alcoholic, healthy controls will sign only one consent form describing the data to be&#xD;
      collected and evaluation for participation in other NIAAA research studies.&#xD;

      This protocol has three purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate non-treatment seeking participants for inclusion or exclusion from other&#xD;
           NIAAA protocols. Non-treatment seeking participants includes individuals with no current&#xD;
           or past alcohol use disorder, as well as individuals who meet the DSM IV criteria for&#xD;
           alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence (alcohol use disorders (AUD) but are not seeking&#xD;
           treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to provide a common set of descriptive information that will be available on all NIAAA&#xD;
           research participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to collect blood samples from participants for the purpose of genetic analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information collected will include such items as psychiatric diagnoses, genotypes of several&#xD;
      neurotransmitter-related and brain growth-related candidate genes, presence or absence of&#xD;
      brain, liver or other organ damage, history of the amount of past alcohol consumption, other&#xD;
      substance use and family history of alcoholism. This information will allow investigators to&#xD;
      determine for which, if any, NIAAA research studies a subject is eligible. It will also allow&#xD;
      investigators to examine the relationship among various candidate genes and brain structure&#xD;
      and/or function in alcoholism.&#xD;
