      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop&#xD;
      growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known&#xD;
      which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for stage III colon cancer. Randomized phase III&#xD;
      trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus leucovorin with or without irinotecan&#xD;
      in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage III colon cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the overall and disease free survival of patients with stage III colon cancer&#xD;
      treated with adjuvant fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium with or without irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess prognostic markers and correlate their expression with disease free and overall&#xD;
      survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the influence of diet, body mass index, and physical activity on the risk of&#xD;
      cancer recurrence and survival in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the influence of diet, obesity, and physical activity on the risk of toxicity&#xD;
      associated with adjuvant therapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine whether pathological features (including tumor grade, tumor mitotic&#xD;
      (proliferation) index, tumor border configuration, and host lymphoid response to tumor; and&#xD;
      lymphatic vessel, venous vessel and perineural invasion) predict outcome in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to lymph&#xD;
      node involvement (1-3 vs 4 or more), histology (poorly differentiated or undifferentiated vs&#xD;
      well or moderately differentiated), and preoperative serum CEA (less than 5.0 ng/mL vs at&#xD;
      least 5.0 ng/mL vs unknown). Study therapy must begin within 21-56 days after surgery.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV beginning 1&#xD;
      hour into leucovorin calcium infusion weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 8 weeks&#xD;
      for 4 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, followed by leucovorin calcium IV,&#xD;
      then followed by fluorouracil IV weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for&#xD;
      5 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a food questionnaire at the beginning of the third course and then at 6&#xD;
      months after study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 2 years, then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1260 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.&#xD;
