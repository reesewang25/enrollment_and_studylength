      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multidisciplinary SCOR examined causes, consequences, and treatments of human&#xD;
      hypertension. A central theme was the renal basis for human hypertension. The subproject on&#xD;
      white coat hypertension began in December of 1985.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the longitudinal study, eighty patients with white coat hypertension were compared with 40&#xD;
      age- and sex-matched normotensives, and with 80 patients with sustained hypertension. The&#xD;
      protocol consisted of (a) clinic blood pressure measurements made both by a physician and a&#xD;
      nurse, (b) self-monitoring at home, (c) noninvasive ambulatory monitoring, (d) reactivity&#xD;
      testing (cold pressor test, mental arithmetic, and isometric exercise) and (e) Korotkoff&#xD;
      signal recording. Patients were also tested for early markers of disease (echocardiography&#xD;
      and urine albumin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 80 patients in each of the two hypertensive groups were randomized to one of four&#xD;
      treatment protocols (20 patients each); an alpha blocker, a beta blocker, a combined alpha-&#xD;
      and beta-blocker, or an ACE inhibitor. The doses of medication were adjusted to produce&#xD;
      similar reductions of clinic blood pressure in the different groups. The test battery (a-e)&#xD;
      was reported during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
