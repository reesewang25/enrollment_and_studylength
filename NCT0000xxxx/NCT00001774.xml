  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry's disease a genetic disorder (X-linked recessive) due to the absence of the enzyme&#xD;
      alpha-galactosidase A. The disease is characterized by abnormal collections of glycolipids in&#xD;
      cells (histiocytes) within blood vessel walls, tumors on the thighs, buttocks, and genitalia,&#xD;
      decreased sweating, tingling sensations in the extremities, and cataracts. Patients with&#xD;
      Fabry 's disease die from complications of the kidney, heart, or brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test the belief that patients with Fabry's disease have a&#xD;
      problem with blood vessels becoming larger. The walls of blood vessels contain muscles that&#xD;
      when they relax the vessel becomes larger. This process is referred to as vasodilation. It is&#xD;
      controlled by a substance released by cells in blood vessels called EDRF (endothelium-derived&#xD;
      relaxing factor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several drugs can affect vasodilation. Researchers believe some drugs may work by blocking&#xD;
      the affect of EDRF. Researchers would like to test the effects of these drugs on the blood&#xD;
      vessels of normal volunteers and patients with Fabry's disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a systematic genetic disease in which patients have abnormal blood vessels,&#xD;
      and leads to numerous complications including cerebrovascular strokes. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to test the hypothesis that patients with Fabry disease have abnormal&#xD;
      endothelial-derived vasodilation. If found to be abnormal, endothelial-derived vasodilation&#xD;
      will serve as a useful clinical outcome measure in the evaluation of the efficacy of specific&#xD;
      treatment of Fabry disease, and possibly of other causes of cerebrovascular stroke. The&#xD;
      endothelium modulates vascular tone by the release of contracting and relaxing substances&#xD;
      that act on the underlying smooth muscle. It has been previously demonstrated that patients&#xD;
      with essential hypertension have a blunted vascular response to acetylcholine (an&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent vasodilator). In the present study, we shall analyze the regional&#xD;
      vascular responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside alone, and in the presence of&#xD;
      L-NMMA (an inhibitor of the synthesis of EDRF by endothelial cells) in 12 patients with Fabry&#xD;
      disease and 12 normal age matched control subjects. We will infuse drugs into the brachial&#xD;
      artery and will measure the responses of the forearm vasculature by means of strain gauge&#xD;
      plethysmography. Forearm blood flow and vascular resistance at baseline and after infusion of&#xD;
      vasoactive drugs, in Fabry patients, will be compared to the responses obtained in the&#xD;
      healthy control population. This study will be performed with collaboration of Dr. Julio A.&#xD;
      Panza, Senior Clinical Investigator from the Cardiology Branch, NHLBI.&#xD;
