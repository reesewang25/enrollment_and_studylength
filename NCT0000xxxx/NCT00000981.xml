  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find oral doses of FIAC (a pyrimidine nucleoside analog) that are effective in treating&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia in HIV-infected immunocompromised patients; to determine&#xD;
      tolerance and safety of FIAC in this patient population; and to determine pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      following multiple doses of FIAC. (An example of another nucleoside analog effective against&#xD;
      retroviruses such as HIV is zidovudine (AZT).) CMV infection is a medically significant&#xD;
      opportunistic disease in patients with HIV-related infection. The purine nucleoside&#xD;
      ganciclovir has been used to treat AIDS patients with CMV disease. Although ganciclovir is&#xD;
      useful in treating CMV disease, such treatment is frequently complicated by hematologic&#xD;
      (blood) toxicity. Also, treatment is difficult because it requires daily intravenous dosing.&#xD;
      Test tube studies show that FIAC and its primary breakdown product FIAU are highly and&#xD;
      specifically active against several viruses including CMV. A single-dose, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (blood level) study showed that FIAC, when taken orally, is readily absorbed into the&#xD;
      bloodstream, and most of it is converted to FIAU.&#xD;

      CMV infection is a medically significant opportunistic disease in patients with HIV-related&#xD;
      infection. The purine nucleoside ganciclovir has been used to treat AIDS patients with CMV&#xD;
      disease. Although ganciclovir is useful in treating CMV disease, such treatment is frequently&#xD;
      complicated by hematologic (blood) toxicity. Also, treatment is difficult because it requires&#xD;
      daily intravenous dosing. Test tube studies show that FIAC and its primary breakdown product&#xD;
      FIAU are highly and specifically active against several viruses including CMV. A single-dose,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (blood level) study showed that FIAC, when taken orally, is readily absorbed&#xD;
      into the bloodstream, and most of it is converted to FIAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are treated as outpatients if general health permits. This is continued for up to 90&#xD;
      days or until failure on basis of efficacy, tolerance, or toxicity. The dose escalation&#xD;
      between groups of patients uses the formula n + 0.7n. Entry of new patients at the next&#xD;
      higher dose is based on results of antiviral, tolerance, and safety data for the prior cohort&#xD;
      when they have received at least 14 days of therapy. Consecutively qualifying patients are&#xD;
      enrolled for each dose group and not based on either disease severity or expected tolerance.&#xD;
      Although not formally randomized due to the sequential nature of the study and serious&#xD;
      medical condition of the patients, every attempt to avoid bias in assigning a patient to a&#xD;
      dose is made. Patients are advised to avoid heavy exercise within 24 hours of any laboratory&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
