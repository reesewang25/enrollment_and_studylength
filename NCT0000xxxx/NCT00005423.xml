      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although considerable evidence exists for associations between diet and subsequent&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) among younger and middle-aged adults, no comprehensive studies&#xD;
      of these relationships have been conducted using a national sample of older Americans.&#xD;
      National guidelines have recommended reductions of dietary fat, saturated fat, cholesterol&#xD;
      and sodium as dietary practice to reduce CVD. However, it is possible that the focus on&#xD;
      eliminating dietary components may obscure the advantages of consuming diets that are&#xD;
      nutritionally adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study could have important implications for setting research priorities to&#xD;
      further study the effects of specific dietary variables on CVD, and for implementing national&#xD;
      nutrition policies to assist Americans in selecting healthy diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from NHANES I and the three cycles of NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) were&#xD;
      used to 1) to examine the associations between several measures of dietary quality at&#xD;
      baseline and subsequent 14-year morbidity and mortality from CVD for a national sample of&#xD;
      6109 United States adults aged 45 to 74 years at baseline; 2) to assess the relative&#xD;
      importance of the associations of dietary quality and CVD for older adults compared to&#xD;
      middle-aged adults. Dietary variables were based on responses to the 24-hour dietary recall&#xD;
      and the food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline and included a composite&#xD;
      measure of dietary quality, intakes of specific nutrients, and usual consumption of foods&#xD;
      from 19 food groups. Baseline measures used as covariates included body mass index, blood&#xD;
      pressure, serum cholesterol, sociodemographic variables (e.g., age, race, income,&#xD;
      occupation), behavioral variables (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, activity level), and&#xD;
      chronic health conditions. CVD outcomes were determined from medical history questionnaires,&#xD;
      hospital records and death certificates. Change in blood pressure between baseline and&#xD;
      10-year followup were examined as an outcome variable as well as a covariate in the&#xD;
      association between diet and CVD.&#xD;
