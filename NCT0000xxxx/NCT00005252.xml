      To explain the extremely low cardiovascular mortality among Physicians' Health Study (PHS)&#xD;
      participants by ascertaining all cardiovascular and total deaths among the 90,457 physicians&#xD;
      who returned enrollment forms but were not randomized into the study. Also, to compare the&#xD;
      mortality experience of randomized physicians with various subgroups of non-participants.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physicians' Health Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary&#xD;
      prevention trial designed to test whether 325 mg aspirin every other day reduced the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and whether 50 mg beta-carotene on alternate days decreased cancer&#xD;
      incidence among 22,071 male physicians, aged 40-84 years in 1982. On December 18, 1987, the&#xD;
      external Data Monitoring Board recommended early termination of the blinded aspirin component&#xD;
      of the trial, based on the emergence of a statistically extreme benefit of aspirin on both&#xD;
      fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, as well as the extraordinarily low cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality rates among study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In January 1982, the Physicians' Health Study investigators purchased a tape from the&#xD;
      American Medical Association that contained the names of all male physicians born between&#xD;
      January 1, 1907 and December 31, 1942. The tape provided the basis for the invitation to join&#xD;
      the trial. A new computer tape was purchased from the AMA that contained names, addresses,&#xD;
      and dates of birth for all physicians registered as of December 1982, current and 1982&#xD;
      addresses, and any reported deaths. This tape was matched against Physician Health Study data&#xD;
      files to eliminate those not on the original tape, as well as those known to be deceased at&#xD;
      the time of the original mailing. When the match was complete, the results were a new tape&#xD;
      that included names, most recent addresses, and dates of birth of all those who were invited&#xD;
      to participate in the trial. A new master study tape was compiled that included all&#xD;
      non-randomized potentially eligible respondents to the invitational mailing as well as a 35&#xD;
      percent random sample of the non-respondents. This group of 138,460 comprised the cohort. The&#xD;
      National Death Index (NDI) was searched from January 1, 1982 to January 25, 1988, the&#xD;
      official termination date of the trial for each physician in the cohort as well as for the&#xD;
      22,071 randomized participants. A copy of the death certificate was obtained from the state&#xD;
      department of vital statistics for each death identified by the NDI in order to distinguish&#xD;
      between vascular and non-vascular deaths. An Endpoints Committee, using death certificates&#xD;
      and medical records in some cases, assigned the cause of death to be entered into the data&#xD;
      base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses were performed comparing: all randomized versus all non-randomized respondents;&#xD;
      those randomized versus those eligible but unwilling to participate; those randomized versus&#xD;
      those initially willing and eligible who enrolled in an 18 week period but were excluded&#xD;
      prior to randomization. Baseline data on the enrollment forms were examined to determine&#xD;
      whether differences in mortality rates could be explained by differences in cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors among the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
