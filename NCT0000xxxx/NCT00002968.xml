    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery with or without monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody therapy in treating patients who have stage II colon cancer. Monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      such as edrecolomab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing&#xD;
      substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether surgery to&#xD;
      remove colon cancer is more effect with or without monoclonal antibody therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether adjuvant treatment with MoAb 17-1A will improve the probability of&#xD;
      overall and disease-free survival, and increase disease-free intervals in patients who have&#xD;
      undergone resection of a Stage II colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether alterations in the expression of cell cycle related genes&#xD;
      (thymidylate synthase, p53, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27) predict&#xD;
      the risk of survival and recurrence in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether alterations in markers of metastatic potential-expression of DCC&#xD;
      and measures of tumor angiogenesis (microvascular density and vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor expression)-predict the risk of survival and recurrence in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether a marker of cellular differentiation-sucrase isomaltase-predicts the&#xD;
      risk of survival and recurrence in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine whether DNA ploidy and cell proliferation are prognostic of tumor recurrence&#xD;
      and overall survival in Stage II colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine whether interactions among these tumor markers identify subsets of patients&#xD;
      with significantly altered outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine whether pathologic features including tumor grade; tumor mitotic&#xD;
      (proliferation) index; tumor border configuration; host lymphoid response to tumor; and&#xD;
      lymphatic vessel, venous vessel and perineural invasion predict outcome in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to degree of&#xD;
      differentiation (well vs moderately well vs poor), vascular or lymphatic invasion (no vs&#xD;
      yes), and preoperative serum CEA (less than 5.0 ng/mL vs at least 5.0 ng/mL vs unknown).&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant edrecolomab IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 5 courses. Patients must begin therapy no earlier than 7 days and no later&#xD;
      than 42 days post-surgical resection. Patients also undergo observation at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients undergo observation at 3 and 6 months post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed after the last course of edrecolomab (arm I) and at 12 months (arm II).&#xD;
      All patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologic documentation of adenocarcinoma of the colon with or without penetration of&#xD;
             the serosa with no lymph node metastases (Stage II pT3N0 or pT4bNO lesions, excluding&#xD;
             pT4aN0; Modified Astler-Coller Stage B2); there can be no distant metastases or&#xD;
             penetration of adjacent organs or structures; proximal, distal, and radial margins&#xD;
             must be free of tumor Important note: A tumor nodule &gt; 3 mm in diameter in the&#xD;
             perirectal or pericolonic adipose tissue without histologic evidence of residual node&#xD;
             in the nodule is classified as regional/pericolonic node metastasis; however, a tumor&#xD;
             nodule =&lt; 3 mm in diameter is classified in the T category as discontinuous extension&#xD;
             (i.e., pT3); multiple metastatic foci seen microscopically only in the pericolonic fat&#xD;
             should be considered as metastasis in a single lymph node for classification; although&#xD;
             six or more nodes evaluated from the specimen is optimal, a minimum of three nodes&#xD;
             (periodic or mesenteric) for evaluation is required for inclusion in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete, en bloc resection of all the primary tumor, performed as an open procedure,&#xD;
             and not laparoscopically or laparoscopically assisted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of perforation or clinical obstruction of the bowel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The gross distal margin of the primary tumor must lie above the peritoneal reflection&#xD;
             (i.e., it must be a colon, not a rectal cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous radiation or chemotherapy for this malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CALGB Performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent treatment with systemic steroids is allowed; patients receiving&#xD;
             replacement steroids for adrenal insufficiency are eligible; patients receiving&#xD;
             inhaled steroids in daily doses of 500mg or less and patients being treated with&#xD;
             topical steroids are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior exposure to murine antibodies (e.g., diagnostic tests like the &quot;oncoscint&#xD;
             scan&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-pregnant and non-lactating; patients of child-bearing potential should agree to&#xD;

             cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or other cancer if the patient has been&#xD;
             disease-free for &gt;= 5 years; patients with more than one synchronous primary colon&#xD;
             tumor are eligible; for the purpose of this protocol, staging classification will be&#xD;
             based on the stage of the more advanced primary tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Granulocytes &gt; 1,800/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/μl&#xD;
