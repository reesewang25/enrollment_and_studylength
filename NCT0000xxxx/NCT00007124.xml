  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of a restricted-carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet) on&#xD;
      Lafora disease-a severe neurological disease in which brain cells die because of abnormal&#xD;
      accumulation of glucose (a type of sugar). Patients with Lafora disease have rapid&#xD;
      neurological deterioration with myoclonus (brief muscle jerks), seizures and mental decline.&#xD;
      At present there is no treatment to halt disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 10 years of age and older with relatively advanced Lafora disease may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Center for the first 4 weeks of&#xD;
      this 6-month study for baseline testing and to start the ketogenic diet. They will have a&#xD;
      complete medical history and physical examination, plus a detailed neurological examination&#xD;
      and blood and urine tests. Procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans to provide information about brain&#xD;
           chemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to analyze chemicals in cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic and endocrinological tests, including a glucose tolerance test, to evaluate&#xD;
           the body's response to a large intake of oral glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard neuropsychological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain and muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain wave activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evoked potentials (SEP and VEP) to study brain responses to mild electric or visual&#xD;
           stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (magnetic stimulation of the brain) may also be done to&#xD;
      study the function of the brain cortex (outer nervous tissue of the brain) and the effects of&#xD;
      treatment on brain excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ketogenic diet will begin after the tests are completed. The diet provides mainly fats to&#xD;
      fuel the body, plus the recommended amount of protein and minimum carbohydrate. Vitamin and&#xD;
      mineral supplements are provided to meet daily requirements. After 2 weeks on the diet, the&#xD;
      patient will be discharged from the hospital and seen daily as an outpatient for another 1 to&#xD;
      2 weeks. During this time the patient or caregiver is trained in preparing the ketogenic&#xD;
      diet, and then the patient is discharged to home. Throughout the study, disease symptoms will&#xD;
      be assessed using standardized rating scales. Blood and urine tests will be done as needed,&#xD;
      as will follow-up brain imaging, neuropsychological and neurophysiological evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A skin and/or muscle biopsy may be done at the first clinic visit to grow skin cells in&#xD;
      culture and to analyze the skin and muscle under a microscope. The biopsy area is numbed with&#xD;
      an anesthetic and a small piece of tissue is removed either with a needle, an instrument&#xD;
      similar to a cookie-cutter or a knife. The skin cells may be used for metabolic studies and&#xD;
      to obtain DNA for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, patients who responded well to the treatment with no significant&#xD;
      adverse side effects may continue the diet for another 12 months. They will be followed at&#xD;
      3-month intervals to monitor side effects and treatment response.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effect and potential disease modifying&#xD;
      effects of a restrictive minimum carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet) in patients with Lafora&#xD;
      Disease. Untreated Lafora Disease is rapidly progressive to death over about 10 years. In an&#xD;
      open label, proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of the ketogenic diet will be&#xD;
      assessed through the use of validated clinical scales, as well as surrogate&#xD;
      neurophysiological and biochemical measures. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent&#xD;
      clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Males and females older than 10 years will be eligible for this study. Younger children may&#xD;
        not be sufficiently cooperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of child-bearing age must be using adequate contraceptive method for at least one&#xD;
        month prior to and during participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All will carry the diagnosis of Lafora disease based on the presence of characteristic&#xD;
        clinical history and neurological findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All will have a relatively advanced disease with at least one of the three cardinal&#xD;
        neurological manifestations: myoclonus, epilepsy and cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will have histological or (preferable) genetic confirmation of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will also be on stable doses of concomitant medications for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
        prior to the onset of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have the presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably&#xD;
        be expected to subject the patient to unwarranted risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have no clinically significant laboratory abnormality that can reasonably be&#xD;
        expected to subject the patient to unwarranted risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have contraindications to the use of ketogenic diet: carnitine&#xD;
        deficiency, organic acidurias, defects in beta-oxidation, clinically significant&#xD;
        nephrolithiasis, and those who are immunosuppressed .&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women will be excluded. Those not practicing effective means of birth control will&#xD;
        be excluded since the influence of this investigational therapy on the unborn child and&#xD;
        reproductive organs is unknown. Urine pregnancy test will be performed on women of&#xD;
        childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Forbidden medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No significant interactions are generally expected between therapy with ketogenic diet and&#xD;
        other concomitant medications. However, those carbohydrate-containing drug preparations&#xD;
        which may interfere with the achievement of persistent ketosis, will be avoided as&#xD;
        possible. Moreover, in case of unexpected hospital visits requiring IV fluids, patients and&#xD;
        their parents will be asked to advise the treating medical staff on the need to avoid the&#xD;
        use of dextrose-containing solutions, to minimize risks of iatrogenic seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anticonvulsant medications, in general, do not negatively interact with the ketogenic diet,&#xD;
        but concomitant use of drugs such as Topiramate (sometimes associated with nephrolithiasis)&#xD;
        will be avoided as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As mentioned earlier, doses of VPA, commonly used in patients with myoclonic epilepsy, will&#xD;
        be decreased by 25%, as KD may significantly elevate serum plasma levels of VPA.&#xD;
