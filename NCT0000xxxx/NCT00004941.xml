      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to investigational site and number of fistulae (single vs&#xD;
      multiple).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive an infusion&#xD;
      of chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) on weeks 0, 2, and 6. Arm II: Patients receive an&#xD;
      infusion of cA2 on weeks 0 and 2, and an infusion of placebo on week 6. Arm III: Patients&#xD;
      receive an infusion of placebo on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every month for 3 months, then every 6-12 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
