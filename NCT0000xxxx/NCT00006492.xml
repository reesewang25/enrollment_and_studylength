  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will screen patients with cerebellar ataxia to check for antibodies that indicate&#xD;
      allergy to gluten (wheat protein) and will study the effect of a gluten-free diet in patients&#xD;
      with these antibodies. Patients with cerebellar ataxia have problems with coordination,&#xD;
      resulting in &quot;clumsiness&quot; and unsteadiness of posture and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many known causes of cerebellar ataxia, but in many patients the cause is unknown&#xD;
      and there are no available treatments. Cerebellar ataxia has been recognized as a&#xD;
      complication of celiac disease, a syndrome characterized by sensitivity to gluten.&#xD;
      Recognizing gluten sensitivity in patients with cerebellar ataxia would be important for two&#xD;
      reasons: it would be one of the rare causes of the disease that are potentially treatable,&#xD;
      and it would identify patients at risk for developing gastrointestinal cancers, particularly&#xD;
      intestinal lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cerebellar ataxia of known or unknown cause and normal healthy volunteers of&#xD;
      any age are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a medical history, physical examination, blood drawn (30&#xD;
      milliliters, or 2 tablespoons) to check for celiac disease antibodies, and possibly other lab&#xD;
      tests. This completes the participation of normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This diagnostic tool&#xD;
      uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to show structural and&#xD;
      chemical changes in tissues. During the scanning, the patient lies on a table in a narrow&#xD;
      cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom&#xD;
      system at all times during the procedure. Scanning times vary from 20 minutes to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have celiac disease antibodies will have an upper gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      endoscopy intestinal biopsy. For this procedure, a flexible tube is inserted into the mouth&#xD;
      and down the throat into the stomach and duodenum (the upper part of the small intestine),&#xD;
      where a small tissue sample is taken for microscopic examination. Patients with these&#xD;
      antibodies will be put on a gluten-free diet and will be followed at NIH every 3 months for&#xD;
      12 months. On the first visit, patients will have their ataxia evaluated using NINDS's ataxia&#xD;
      scale and will meet with a dietitian for instructions for a gluten-free diet. On the second&#xD;
      through fifth visits (after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively, on the gluten-free diet),&#xD;
      patients will have their ataxia evaluated, speak with a dietitian to assess their nutritional&#xD;
      status, weight, and compliance with the diet, and provide a blood sample for celiac disease&#xD;
      antibody testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the study, patients may choose to continue or stop the gluten-free diet.&#xD;
      If the ataxia assessments show improvement, patients will be advised to continue the&#xD;
      gluten-free diet permanently.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In many patients with cerebellar ataxia, the etiology is unknown. Sensitivity to gluten&#xD;
      (wheat protein) has been suggested as a cause for cerebellar ataxia even in the absence of&#xD;
      malabsorption symptoms or intestinal pathology. However, the prevalence of gluten sensitivity&#xD;
      in patients presenting with cerebellar ataxia is unknown and the effect of gluten-free diet&#xD;
      on gluten sensitivity-associated cerebellar ataxia has not been systematically studied. The&#xD;
      aim of this project is: 1) To identify gluten sensitive cerebellar ataxia patients attending&#xD;
      the Human Motor Control Clinic at the NIH using tests for celiac disease antibodies as a&#xD;
      screening method. 2) To conduct open-label controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of gluten-free diet in the patients identified using a detailed cerebellar ataxia scale as an&#xD;
      objective clinical measure.&#xD;
