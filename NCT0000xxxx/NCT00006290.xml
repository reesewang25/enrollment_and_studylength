  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how changes in body build affect the lives of people&#xD;
      taking anti-HIV medications. By learning this, a set of questions can be created to help&#xD;
      understand how changes in body build and image affect people living with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of questions used to measure body image might be useful in future HIV studies. It may&#xD;
      help doctors understand patient concerns about their body image and why some patients stop&#xD;
      taking their anti-HIV medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A valid measure of body image would be useful for AACTG studies. Such a measure might permit&#xD;
      investigators to examine dissatisfaction with body image as a predictor variable in analyses&#xD;
      of premature study drug discontinuation, loss to follow-up, and study drug non-adherence, and&#xD;
      as a secondary outcome in antiretroviral and fat redistribution treatment trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six focus group interviews, each lasting approximately 2 hours, are conducted at 4 AACTG&#xD;
      sites. Separate groups are run for men and women, and male groups are segmented by sexual&#xD;
      orientation. A moderator leads discussions about patients' perceived changes in body habitus&#xD;
      and body image. Group interviews are audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative&#xD;
      interview data are sent electronically to the Data Management Center, where they are&#xD;
      thematically analyzed using qualitative data analysis (content analysis) techniques. Salient&#xD;
      focus group findings are used to construct questionnaire items.&#xD;

          -  Are experiencing at least 1 of the following symptoms associated with fat changes due&#xD;
             to HIV: 1) increase in belt or waist size; 2) increase in size of back of neck; 3)&#xD;
             increase in bra, shirt, or blouse size to fit increasing breast size; 4) fat increase&#xD;
             in other areas of the body; 5) loss of facial fat; 6) loss of fat in arms or legs; 7)&#xD;
             loss of fat in buttocks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Are able to speak and read English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken 2 or more anti-HIV medications for a total of at least 6 months at any time&#xD;
             before entering this study. Patients must have taken some anti-HIV treatment during&#xD;
             the 6-month period before study entry. Patients who have stopped taking these&#xD;
             medications in the 6 months before study entry may still be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are willing to talk about personal topics in a taped group interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are male and either gay or bisexual (if enrolling in the Ohio State University or&#xD;
             University of California focus groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are either female or heterosexual male (if enrolling in the University of Pennsylvania&#xD;
             or Johns Hopkins University focus groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a mental disability that, in the opinion of the researcher, could interfere with&#xD;
             study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have already taken part in an A5089 focus group interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have diabetes or Cushing's disease or have had surgery that might otherwise explain&#xD;
             changes in body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have changes in diet or physical activity that might explain changes in body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
