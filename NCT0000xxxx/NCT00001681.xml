      The factors that influence HIV disease progression are not well understood. While larger&#xD;
      amounts of circulating virus (high 'viral loads') predict future adverse clinical events,&#xD;
      many of the clinical factors responsible for high viral loads and disease progression remain&#xD;
      unknown. Certain clinical events and defined interventions are associated with increases in&#xD;
      plasma viral RNA concentrations. One of these clinical interventions is immunization;&#xD;
      immunization with several vaccines have been shown to increase plasma HIV RNA concentrations.&#xD;
      Even though vaccination can lead to transient increases in plasma HIV concentrations, certain&#xD;
      vaccines, including influenza vaccine, are still recommended for HIV patients because the&#xD;
      risks of the disease targeted by the immunization are held to be greater than the&#xD;
      immunization itself. Therefore, immunization with influenza vaccine can be considered a&#xD;
      model, clinically indicated intervention, given at a known time which stimulates HIV&#xD;
      replication. For influenza immunization, and for other treatments leading to increases in&#xD;
      viral RNA concentrations is not available. We hypothesize that immunization with influenza&#xD;
      vaccine, and perhaps other immune stimulatory events, lead to an increase in HIV replication&#xD;
      through a regulatory system involving cytokines, signal transduction systems, transcription&#xD;
      factors, effects on the cell cycle, and increased expression of additional gene products&#xD;
      needed for viral replication, such as genes of the nucleic acid biosynthetic pathways. While&#xD;
      experiments aimed at investigating one or another particular part of this regulatory system&#xD;
      can be performed with traditionally available technologies, such technologies cannot provide&#xD;
      comprehensive information concerning a large number of the regulatory events that may be&#xD;
      involved in mediating the increase in HIV RNA concentration. In this protocol, we aim to&#xD;
      develop the methodologies needed to determine changes in expression of many of the genes&#xD;
      which may be involved in mediating the regulation of HIV expression in HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      using cDNA microarray technologies. Once the methodologies are developed, such work may&#xD;
      provide new insights into the regulatory systems controlling HIV expression in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HIV disease.&#xD;
