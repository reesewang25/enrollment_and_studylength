  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on bone&#xD;
      marrow stem cells in healthy volunteers with sickle cell trait and determine if cells&#xD;
      collected for transplantation from donors with sickle cell trait require special handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells, which the bone marrow produces, are responsible for making all the different&#xD;
      kinds of blood cells. They are the cells used in bone marrow, or stem cell, transplantation.&#xD;
      The drug G-CSF, which is a naturally occurring hormone, causes stem cells to mobilize-that&#xD;
      is, to be released from the bone marrow and enter the blood stream. This drug is given to&#xD;
      stem cell donors to increase the amount of cells that can be collected. Stem cell donors for&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell disease are often healthy siblings of the patient who have a&#xD;
      matching bone marrow type. Some siblings carry the sickle cell trait, however, and, even&#xD;
      though they do not have sickle cell disease and their blood and bone marrow are normal, it is&#xD;
      not known how their cells will react to G-CSF stimulation. Nor is it known if their stem&#xD;
      cells require special methods of removal, processing or storing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 years or older with sickle cell trait who have no history of sickle&#xD;
      cell disease and no known medical problems may be eligible for this study. Participants will&#xD;
      have a medical history and physical examination, including blood tests and urinalysis. They&#xD;
      will receive injections of G-CSF under the skin once a day for 5 days. On the fifth day, stem&#xD;
      cells will be collected through leukapheresis. In this procedure, whole blood is drawn from&#xD;
      an arm vein, similar to donating whole blood. The blood then circulates through a cell&#xD;
      separator machine, the stem cells are removed, and the rest of the blood is transfused back&#xD;
      to the donor through a vein in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gained from this study will be used to ensure the safety of stem cell donors&#xD;
      with sickle cell trait and to better prepare stem cells for transplantation in sickle cell&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sickle cell disease are increasingly becoming eligible for transplantation as&#xD;
      the techniques of stem cell transplantation continue to improve, leading to less morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. However, the availability of a matched donor still remains one of the main&#xD;
      obstacles. Given the inherited nature of this disease, many HLA-matched siblings of patients&#xD;
      with sickle cell disease have sickle cell trait. Therefore, patients with sickle cell trait&#xD;
      presumably have been used as donors for patients with sickle cell disease. However, there are&#xD;
      no published data on whether special manipulations are required for the maintenance and&#xD;
      storage of stem cells collected from patients with sickle cell trait. The effects of&#xD;
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced stem cell mobilization in these&#xD;
      patients are also not known. Also, due to the potential of HbS gellation in red cells, the&#xD;
      freezing of stem cells derived from individuals with sickle cell trait may require a more&#xD;
      stringent red cell removal than is normally performed. We would like to evaluate these issues&#xD;
      using volunteers with sickle cell trait prior to beginning our own transplant protocol for&#xD;
      sickle cell disease.&#xD;
