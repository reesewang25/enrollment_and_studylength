    <textblock>
      To determine if dual chamber rate-modulated pacing (DDDR) in patients with sick sinus&#xD;
      syndrome is superior to single chamber pacing (VVIR) with respect to subsequent frequency of&#xD;
      adverse clinical events such as stroke, quality of life and function, and cost effectiveness.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permanent pacing is estimated to cost one billion dollars annually in health care costs in&#xD;
      the United States. Initially, pacing was primarily confined to ventricular pacing with&#xD;
      limited sensing, programming and pacing capacity. Tremendous growth has occurred in pacing&#xD;
      technology, making available dual chamber pacing with sophisticated sensing, pacing, and rate&#xD;
      control. These more advanced pacemakers are more costly and complicated to place surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common indications for pacing is sick sinus syndrome. Initial therapy is&#xD;
      usually medical to inhibit the tachyarrhythmias (most commonly paroxysmal atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation). However, if symptomatic bradycardia results, then permanent pacing is commonly&#xD;
      employed. The appropriate type of pacing in this setting is not clearly defined and is&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of atrioventricular pacing was principally aimed at improving cardiac&#xD;
      hemodynamics and creating a more physiological heart rate control. Hemodynamic studies have&#xD;
      clearly shown the benefit of this approach in many patients, particularly those with&#xD;
      decreased left ventricular compliance in whom atrial activity contributes significantly to&#xD;
      cardiac output. Lack of synchronization between the upper and lower chambers of the heart&#xD;
      caused by pacing the ventricle alone can result in a constellation of symptoms commonly&#xD;
      referred to as &quot;pacemaker syndrome&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanisms by which dual chamber pacing is purported to improve outcome is&#xD;
      straightforward; in patients with normal sinus rhythm, cardiac output is improved by 15 to 30&#xD;
      percent. In addition, a number of retrospective studies that have compared single chamber&#xD;
      with atrial-based or dual chamber pacing have suggested that the latter may prevent adverse&#xD;
      clinical events such as atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular&#xD;
      accidents, and death. While none of these studies was a randomized trial, the literature is&#xD;
      consistent with a concept that dual mode pacing results in improved hemodynamics and a more&#xD;
      favorable outcome in patients with sick sinus syndrome. However, the data do not provide&#xD;
      definitive answers because of small sample sizes and methodological problems. A major&#xD;
      problems with all previous studies is probable selection bias favoring implantation of dual&#xD;
      chamber devices in younger, healthier patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several small studies have compared functional status and other quality of life measures&#xD;
      between single and dual chamber pacing modes and have suggested better quality of life&#xD;
      outcomes for the dual chamber mode. Again, these conclusions are severly hampered by the&#xD;
      sample sizes, the lack of random assignment or adequate statistical adjustment to control for&#xD;
      confounding, use of outdated and/or invalid measures, and potential response bias due to&#xD;
      awareness of mode assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter, randomized clinical trial. All patients received a dual chamber pacemaker&#xD;
      capable of either single or dual chamber rate modulated pacing. Patients were then randomized&#xD;
      to either the single chamber mode or the dual chamber mode. Patients with prior stroke were&#xD;
      pre-stratified. Clinical and electrocardiographic data were collected during a 1.5 to 4.5&#xD;
      year follow-up. The primary endpoint was either: first occurrence of stroke, or; total&#xD;
      (all-cause) mortality. Secondary endpoints included health status, cost-effectiveness,&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality, composite of any of the three major adverse effects expected in&#xD;
      sick sinus syndrome patients (total mortality alone or first stroke or congestive heart&#xD;
      failure hospitalization), first occurrence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure score,&#xD;
      pacemaker syndrome, health status in women and in the elderly, and outcome of patients with&#xD;
      risk factors for pacemaker syndrome. Enrollment was completed in October, 1999 with a total&#xD;
      of 2,010 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life and economic issues were assessed in patients at entry and annually for three&#xD;
      years. Questionnaire-based measures of health status and quality of life were compared in the&#xD;
      two pacing groups for the entire population and subgroups defined by age and gender. The&#xD;
      economic substudy measured the comparative costs, both direct and indirect medical and&#xD;
      nonmedical, of the two pacing modes in an attempt to determine the most cost-effective&#xD;
      approach to pacemaker treatment of sick sinus syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment started October 1, 1995 and was completed October 4, 1999 with 2,010 patients&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
