  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease are missing the chemical neurotransmitter dopamine. This&#xD;
      occurs as a result of destructive changes in an area of the brain responsible for making&#xD;
      dopamine, the basal ganglia. Muscle tremors, rigidity of movement, shuffling footsteps,&#xD;
      droopy posture, and a mask-like expression on the face characterize Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the effects of a new drug, N-9023. The drug acts like&#xD;
      dopamine and can be given through a skin patch (transdermal) for treatment of parkinsonian&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to find out whether N-9023 is useful in treating the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease and to determine the best dose of N-9023 that is safe and&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;

      The acute safety and antiparkinsonian efficacy of transdermally delivered N-0923 will be&#xD;
      evaluated in patients with Parkinson's disease. This dopamine receptor agonist will be&#xD;
      administered transdermally under double-blind conditions, in a rising dose paradigm.&#xD;
      Antiparkinsonian activity will be quantified by means of standard rating scales. Possible&#xD;
      adverse events will be assessed by appropriate clinical and laboratory tests.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        All patients will carry a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease based on the presence of a&#xD;
        characteristic clinical history and neurological findings. Symptom severity will range from&#xD;
        Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage II-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males and females between the ages 30-76 are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Initial emphasis will be on patients who are taking few or no other medications than&#xD;
        levodopa for their Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject&#xD;
        the patient to unwarranted risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with a history of significant cardiac (myocardial infarction within 12 months&#xD;
        prior to study, dysrhythmia; QTc intervals greater than 440 msec).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who are convulsive, hepatic, or with renal disorders (exceeding the upper limit&#xD;
        of normal values for LFT's and creatinine respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with evidence of other serious medical illness, a history of alcohol or drug&#xD;
        abuse, those who have participated in an investigational trial within 28 days prior to&#xD;
        study, and pregnant or nursing women or anyone not practicing effective means of birth&#xD;
        control.&#xD;
