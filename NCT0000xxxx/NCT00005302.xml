      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was well established that drugs played a role in the etiology of aplastic anemia,&#xD;
      agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenic purpura. In 1985, much of the evidence concerning the&#xD;
      relation of exposure to drugs to the risk of the three dyscrasias was based on case reports.&#xD;
      Such reports could sometimes be appropriate for raising hypotheses, but they rarely served to&#xD;
      establish associations firmly. They could also be subject to selection bias due to a tendency&#xD;
      to publish reports only when a dyscrasia followed the use of a drug already under suspicion,&#xD;
      and could result in spurious and non-causal associations. Moreover, since denominator&#xD;
      populations were not known, case reports could never provide quantitative estimates of&#xD;
      associations, either in terms of their magnitude or of the incidence rates attributable to&#xD;
      the specific exposures The sparse quantitative information that did exist was of variable&#xD;
      quality because of methodological and other difficulties. And while overall incidence rates,&#xD;
      within orders of magnitude, could be estimated for the three dyscrasias, there was virtually&#xD;
      no acceptably reliable information available on the incidence rates due to specific drugs.&#xD;
      Even for well known associations such as aplastic anemia with chloramphenicol, estimates of&#xD;
      incidence, if given at all, were imprecise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of drugs incriminated at one time or another in the etiology of each dyscrasia was&#xD;
      as long as the pharmacopoeia itself. Based on the clinical evidence, however, there were&#xD;
      patterns for each dyscrasia, some of which overlapped. Drugs commonly linked to aplastic&#xD;
      anemia included chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, sulfonamides, and&#xD;
      antithyroid drugs; all of them, except chloramphenicol, were also implicated in the etiology&#xD;
      of agranulocytosis, together with phenothiazine derivatives. The same drugs were commonly&#xD;
      linked to thrombocytopenia, which had also frequently been linked to the use of quinidine.&#xD;
      The exact listing of drugs related to each disorder varied between reports and, presumably,&#xD;
      between patterns of drug use in different populations. One major concern in 1985 was with all&#xD;
      of the newer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs currently on the market in the United&#xD;
      States. There were numerous case reports implicating these drugs in the etiology of all three&#xD;
      dyscrasias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design was that of a case-control study. All hospitals with at least 100 beds in&#xD;
      geographically defined areas of eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island were enrolled. All&#xD;
      cases of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis were identified prospectively for the purpose of&#xD;
      estimating incidence rates. A proportion of cases of thrombocytopenic purpura were identified&#xD;
      but incidence rates were not estimated. The eligibility of cases was determined by a&#xD;
      committee of hematologists, according to strict diagnostic criteria. All identified cases of&#xD;
      the dyscrasias, suitable hospital controls, and, in Massachusetts, neighbor controls were&#xD;
      interviewed. Information was obtained on drug use, occupational and chemical exposure,&#xD;
      personal data, and relevant medical history. The data were used to quantify known&#xD;
      associations between the three dyscrasias and drug use, to identify and quantify previously&#xD;
      unsuspected associations, and to document absence of associations for commonly used drugs.&#xD;
      Incidence rates of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis attributable to specific drugs and&#xD;
      classes of drugs were estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
