  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first period of this study, an initial pharmacological assessment of fluorouracil&#xD;
      administered intravenously along with oral leucovorin calcium is made. Leucovorin calcium is&#xD;
      given orally bid on days 1-3. Fluorouracil is given as a 24 hour infusion on day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 2 week rest period and resolution of any toxicities experienced during the first&#xD;
      period of treatment, patients are given an escalating dose of fluorouracil with fixed doses&#xD;
      of leucovorin calcium and ethynyluracil. Ethynyluracil and leucovorin calcium are given bid&#xD;
      orally on days 1-3 of each week. Fluorouracil is given bid orally on day 2 of each week.&#xD;
      Treatment is repeated for three weeks followed by a one week rest period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 to 6 patients are enrolled at each dose level. Dose escalation proceeds until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or&#xD;
      more patients experience dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this Phase I protocol is to develop an orally administered regimen of&#xD;
      fluorouracil (5-FU) given with fixed doses of leucovorin (LV) and 776C85 (GW776), a&#xD;
      mechanism-based inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the rate-limiting enzyme&#xD;
      involved in the catabolism of 5-FU. In the presence of 776C85, 5-FU is cleared by renal&#xD;
      mechanisms. The schedule employed is intended to mimic the pharmacologic profile associated&#xD;
      with a 24 hour weekly continuous infusion of 5-FU without the need for an indwelling central&#xD;
      venous catheter. The target population is adult cancer patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first week, each patient will receive a single dose of 5-FU given by 24 hour continuous&#xD;
      IV infusion at its recommended Phase II dose with low-dose oral LV. In the third week, the&#xD;
      patient will begin 776C85 (GW776) and LV PO on days 1, 2, 3 at fixed doses. Oral 5-FU will be&#xD;
      given on day 2, and the dose will be escalated in successive cohorts of patients. Treatment&#xD;
      will be repeated weekly for three weeks, followed by a one week break. The dose of 5-FU will&#xD;
      be adjusted according to individual tolerance. Cohorts of three patients will be entered at&#xD;
      each dose level of 5-FU, which will be escalated until dose-limiting toxicity is seen&#xD;
      (guidelines are outlined in the following schema). Treatment will be continued indefinitely&#xD;
      until evidence of disease progression, provided the patient is tolerating therapy and wishes&#xD;
      to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical monitoring suggests that there is profound and sustained inhibition of DPD with a&#xD;
      single dose of 20 mg PO 776C85 days 1-3 each week for three of four weeks. Once the MTD has&#xD;
      been defined for the once daily dosing on days 1, 2, 3 schedule, a simplified schedule will&#xD;
      be evaluated in which a single dose of 776C85 on day 1 in the evening, with oral leucovorin&#xD;
      days 1 and 2, and 5-FU given day 2 as a single dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the pharmaceutical company has decided to go with a combined tablet of eniluracil/5-FU&#xD;
      for future studies, the new schedule will be oral leucovorin on days 1 &amp; 2, with 776C85 and&#xD;
      5-FU both given day 2 as a single dose.&#xD;
