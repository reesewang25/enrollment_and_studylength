  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with certain corneal and external&#xD;
      diseases of the eye (diseases of the surface of the eye and its surrounding structures). The&#xD;
      protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will receive current&#xD;
      standard of care treatments. The purpose of the study is twofold: 1) to allow National Eye&#xD;
      Institute physicians to increase their knowledge of various corneal and external conditions&#xD;
      and identify possible new avenues of research in this area; and 2) to establish a pool of&#xD;
      patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are developed. (Participants in this&#xD;
      protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision will be voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults with corneal or external eye diseases may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history, brief physical examination, thorough eye&#xD;
      examination and blood test. The eye examination includes measurements of eye pressure and&#xD;
      visual acuity (ability to see the vision chart) and dilation of the pupils to examine the&#xD;
      lens and retina (back part of the eye). Patients will also undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eye photography - Special photographs of the inside of the eye to help evaluate the&#xD;
           status of the cornea and conjunctiva (the most superficial layer of the eye) evaluate&#xD;
           changes that may occur in the future. From two to 20 pictures may be taken, depending on&#xD;
           the eye condition. The camera flashes a bright light into the eye for each picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conjunctival or lacrimal gland biopsy - A small piece of the conjunctiva or the lacrimal&#xD;
           (tear) gland, is removed for examination under the microscope. Anesthetic drops and&#xD;
           possibly an injection of anesthetic are given to numb the eye. An antibiotic ointment&#xD;
           and patch may be placed over the eye for several hours after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed at least 3 years. Follow-up visits are scheduled according to&#xD;
      the standard of care for the individual patient's eye problem. Vision will be checked at each&#xD;
      visit, and some of the tests described above may be repeated to follow the progress of&#xD;
      disease and evaluate the response to any treatment that is given.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will permit the specialists in cornea and external disease at the NEI to&#xD;
      identify, follow and provide &quot;standard of care&quot; treatment to patients with various corneal&#xD;
      and external disease and anterior segment disorders. By providing long-term follow-up and&#xD;
      treatment for a variety of corneal and external diseases, the corneal specialists at NEI will&#xD;
      be better able to identify research hypotheses about these diseases in addition to&#xD;
      maintaining their clinical skills. Another purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a cohort&#xD;
      of patients with corneal diseases for possible participation in new NEI clinical trials and&#xD;
      epidemiological protocols. The availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of&#xD;
      anterior segment diseases will be valuable for the training of fellows, an important&#xD;
      component of the mission of the NEI. The ability to provide follow-up and care will also&#xD;
      facilitate referral efforts for NEI protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cornea specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those conditions&#xD;
      that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be enrolled in the&#xD;
      protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments. Any&#xD;
      evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of care as&#xD;
      appropriate for the relevant ocular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for potential&#xD;
      eligibility in other NEI clinical trials or epidemiologic protocols as they are developed. If&#xD;
      eligible, they may be asked to participate in the new protocol; however, they will not be&#xD;
      required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be entirely voluntary.&#xD;
