      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining carboplatin and temozolomide&#xD;
      in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of carboplatin and temozolomide in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. II. Assess the safety of this cytotoxic&#xD;
      combination in this patient population. III. Assess the preliminary evidence of efficacy of&#xD;
      this combination in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive oral temozolomide&#xD;
      once daily on days 1-5. Carboplatin IV is administered over 1 hour on day 1. Courses are&#xD;
      repeated every 28 days. Treatment continues for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      toxicity and disease progression. Sequential dose escalation of carboplatin with a fixed dose&#xD;
      of temozolomide is followed by sequential dose escalation of carboplatin at a higher fixed&#xD;
      dose of temozolomide. Dose escalation in cohorts of 3-6 patients each continues until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at&#xD;
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxic effects. If the combination&#xD;
      treatment with carboplatin given on day 1 of temozolomide therapy is more toxic than&#xD;
      anticipated, then the study is repeated with carboplatin given on day 5 of temozolomide&#xD;
      therapy. Patients are followed at least every 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
