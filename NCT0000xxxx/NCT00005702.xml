      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cigarette smoking is a vitally important public health problem. It is a major contributor to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and one of the leading causes of cancer and respiratory disease.&#xD;
      Research in primary care over the last two decades has indicated that smoking cessation&#xD;
      interventions in medical settings can be effective. However, there have been few published&#xD;
      reports of research examining the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in&#xD;
      hospital settings. In-patient smoking cessation interventions can potentially reach a large&#xD;
      number of smokers. A hospital stay can also be an effective &quot;teachable moment&quot; for smoking&#xD;
      cessation advice. Smoking bans in place in hospitals make it a time of enforced abstinence&#xD;
      and therefore, an opportunity to overcome the symptoms of physical addiction. Patients are&#xD;
      removed from their usual environmental cues for smoking, making initial cessation easier, and&#xD;
      they might be particularly receptive to preventive health messages at a time of ill-health.&#xD;
      Finally, there is increased access to health care providers whom patients see as valid and&#xD;
      knowledgeable sources of health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All smokers admitted to three hospitals over a 27-month period were identified as part of the&#xD;
      admissions process. Those who met eligibility requirements were randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      three treatment conditions: minimal care; a low intensity intervention whose centerpiece was&#xD;
      brief firm advice by health care providers and labelling of the smokers' charts (PA&#xD;
      intervention); and the PA intervention plus more intensive counseling and follow-up after&#xD;
      discharge performed by a research nurse (PA+NC intervention). Intervention components&#xD;
      included provision of smoking cessation manuals and training of health care providers (all&#xD;
      conditions); structural reminders to health care providers to give smoking cessation advice&#xD;
      and provision of smoking cessation advice by a variety of health care providers on several&#xD;
      different occasions (PA and PA+NC); and in-hospital counseling tailored to patient&#xD;
      characteristics, feedback about a biological marker of smoking, a stepped care approach, and&#xD;
      follow-up telephone counseling after discharge (PA+NC only). All participants were followed&#xD;
      for twelve months after discharge from the hospital to examine the relative effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the smoking cessation programs. In addition, information about smoking&#xD;
      cessation advice given to study patients by primary care physicians in the twelve months&#xD;
      after discharge from hospital was gathered to assess the possible synergistic effects of&#xD;
      advice provided in in-patient and out-patient settings.&#xD;
