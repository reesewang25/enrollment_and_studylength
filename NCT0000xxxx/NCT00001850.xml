  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to allow inpatient and outpatient evaluation of women with a variety&#xD;
      of reproductive and endocrine-related disorders for purposes of research and physician&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations may include ultrasound examinations, blood, saliva, and/or urine samples. In&#xD;
      some cases, specific laboratory or X-ray studies will be performed to confirm the diagnosis&#xD;
      or assist in the treatment of the patient. These additional tests will be conducted within&#xD;
      the guidelines of current gynecologic practice. In some cases, the patient will receive&#xD;
      medical or surgical treatment for their disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide an opportunity for physicians to evaluate women with&#xD;
      medical conditions of reproduction. These evaluations and treatments will support clinical&#xD;
      training and research for the accredited training program in reproductive endocrinology at&#xD;
      the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;

      The specific objective of this protocol is to gain knowledge and collect data in order to&#xD;
      allow for hypothesis generation in future research as well as give NICHD investigators and&#xD;
      trainees hands on experience related to the diagnoses, management, treatment and follow-up of&#xD;
      reproductive endocrine disorders. Such disorders include but are not limited to Polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian syndrome, Endometriosis, Primary ovarian insufficiency, Recurrent pregnancy loss,&#xD;
      Primary amenorrhea and Infertility. This information will be taken from standard medical&#xD;
      care/procedures and follow up of patients and healthy volunteers. It allows investigation&#xD;
      into the problems of these patients for the purpose of furthering general knowledge and&#xD;
      teaching.&#xD;

        -  Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects aged 1-85 with reproductive endocrine related conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Young women, women of reproductive age, and older women are the focus of this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Girls with reproductive disorders under the age of 18 will be studied and their assent&#xD;
             will be obtained if possible along with the consent of their parent/guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reproductive disorders of men will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women over 23 weeks will be excluded, since there are no on-campus prenatal&#xD;
             or neonatal facilities. If we see patients in consultation after 23 weeks, as is our&#xD;
             practice, we will provide a report to the referring PI on that protocol as well as the&#xD;
             patient's personal obstetrician. We do not provide long term obstetrical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients specifically requesting in vitro fertilization will not be considered&#xD;
             candidates and will not be seen under this protocol. These patients may be seen for a&#xD;
             consultation, but will be referred for these services outside of the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients requiring fetal surgery will be excluded since there are no&#xD;
             on-campus neonatal facilities.&#xD;
