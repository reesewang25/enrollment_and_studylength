  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of the personal computer (PC) in occupational therapy. The&#xD;
      results of the study will help occupational therapists develop improved treatment activities&#xD;
      using PCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in various NIH clinical trials who are referred for occupational therapy&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Each patient will have at least four computer sessions within&#xD;
      6 months. They will use the PC to achieve goals they set for themselves-for example, to build&#xD;
      work skills, improve concentration, or simply have fun. At the end of each session, the&#xD;
      occupational therapist will interview the patient, asking, for example, about the goal of the&#xD;
      session and what may have occurred during the session to make it more helpful or less&#xD;
      helpful. The interviews will be tape recorded and used to help determine how computers may be&#xD;
      used most therapeutically.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Occupational therapy approaches rehabilitation through the concept of &quot;occupation&quot;, the&#xD;
      component of human behavior regarding one's engagement in self-initiated, self-directed,&#xD;
      adaptive, purposeful, culturally relevant, organized activity. Rehabilitation through&#xD;
      occupation is a process, stemming from interactions among the three domains: (a) performance&#xD;
      areas; (b) performance components; and (c) performance contexts. At the core of the&#xD;
      occupational therapy is a sub-process created by patients and therapists through their&#xD;
      actions and reactions to treatment. It is a significant sub-process because it sets into&#xD;
      motion the use of occupation as therapy. It is believed that the appropriate, therapeutic use&#xD;
      of occupation affects &quot;performance&quot; or how one functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to develop ways to articulate and measure complex therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      themselves. This is especially true of those treatment approaches which integrate human&#xD;
      relationships, collaborative problem-solving, and the targeted doing of unique, personally&#xD;
      relevant occupations. Occupational therapy is a health profession characterized by such&#xD;
      interventions. The capacity to delineate key process variables may lead to credible&#xD;
      examination of process-outcome relationships. Ultimately, results from the proposed study may&#xD;
      provide information needed to further establish patient outcomes from occupational therapy&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
