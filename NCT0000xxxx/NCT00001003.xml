  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate and compare 3 anti-pneumocystis regimens plus zidovudine (AZT) in persons with&#xD;
      advanced HIV disease and T4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3. To establish the range of pentamidine&#xD;
      (PEN) deposition in AIDS patients participating in ACTG 021 and ACTG 081. To identify factors&#xD;
      (breathing pattern, pulmonary function) that may be important in affecting the actual dose&#xD;
      delivered to a given patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific system that is used to deliver PEN to the lungs may determine whether a&#xD;
      therapeutically effective dose is attained in the lungs. Therefore, this study will establish&#xD;
      the amount of PEN that is deposited in the lungs of patients enrolled in protocols ACTG 021&#xD;
      and ACTG 081, who are being treated with PEN administered from the Marquest Respirgard II&#xD;
      nebulizer.&#xD;

      The specific system that is used to deliver PEN to the lungs may determine whether a&#xD;
      therapeutically effective dose is attained in the lungs. Therefore, this study will establish&#xD;
      the amount of PEN that is deposited in the lungs of patients enrolled in protocols ACTG 021&#xD;
      and ACTG 081, who are being treated with PEN administered from the Marquest Respirgard II&#xD;
      nebulizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 4 weeks after patients in ACTG 021 and ACTG 081 have begun PEN aerosol therapy&#xD;
      for the prevention of PCP, patients undergo the first radioactive aerosol study. The patient&#xD;
      inhales a mist while sitting with his/her back against a gamma camera. The resulting picture&#xD;
      outlines the lungs. This mist contains a single dose of PEN mixed with a small amount of&#xD;
      radioactivity (99m-technetium ertechnetate). The gamma camera determines where the particles&#xD;
      deposit in the lungs. The radioactivity exposure is equivalent to a typical xray of the ribs.&#xD;
      This procedure takes about 45 minutes; 6 hours later another 30-minute gamma camera image is&#xD;
      obtained. Blood is withdrawn to measure the blood level of PEN as done in ACTG 021 and ACTG&#xD;
      081. The entire procedure is repeated near the end of the prophylactic schedule (about 10-12&#xD;
      months after the start of aerosol PEN treatments).&#xD;
