  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify and characterize immune factors involved in hepatitis C infection&#xD;
      and elimination of the virus. Individual responses to hepatitis C infection vary; some people&#xD;
      are able to eliminate the virus, whereas others remain chronically infected. This study may&#xD;
      identify factors important in preventing infection that may be of help in developing a&#xD;
      vaccine or more effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People over 18 years old who have been exposed to hepatitis C virus may participate in this&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be recruited from the National Institutes of Health, Inova Fairfax&#xD;
      Hospital, Occupational Medical Services-IDP P.C., Washington Hospital Center and Holy Cross&#xD;
      Hospital, all in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Individual patients from other&#xD;
      centers will also be recruited on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 40 to 60 cc (1 to 2 ounces) of blood drawn at seven intervals. The&#xD;
      first collection will be as soon as possible after exposure to hepatitis C virus and then&#xD;
      again at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 weeks after exposure. The white blood cells will be studied&#xD;
      for their response to the virus, and markers for infection will be followed. If infection&#xD;
      develops, additional samples of blood may be requested, and patients will be offered&#xD;
      evaluation for treatment. Test results will be kept confidential and will not be entered into&#xD;
      any medical records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The course and outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is determined by both host and&#xD;
      viral factors, none of which have been well defined. In this study, we will follow and assess&#xD;
      patients who are occupationally exposed to HCV for viral and immunologic factors that may&#xD;
      relate to disease outcome. This protocol is mostly a sample acquisition protocol to support&#xD;
      laboratory research. Patients will be interviewed and have blood (and lymphocytes) taken as&#xD;
      soon as possible after exposure and again after 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks. Virological&#xD;
      markers, serum antibodies and both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to HCV will be monitored.&#xD;
      Persons who develop hepatitis C will be referred for therapy or enrolled in therapeutic&#xD;
      trials currently in place at the National Institutes of Health. These studies will help&#xD;
      define the relative roles of virological and immunological factors in determining the course&#xD;
      and outcome of HCV infection.&#xD;
