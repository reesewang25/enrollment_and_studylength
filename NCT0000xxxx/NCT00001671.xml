  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leukodystrophy is a disease of the white matter of the brain. White matter is the portion of&#xD;
      the brain responsible for conducting electrical impulses from one area of the brain to the&#xD;
      other. Insulating cells called myelin cover the brain and nerve cells in the white matter. If&#xD;
      myelin becomes damaged electrical information cannot be transferred properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients suffering from leukodystrophies do not fit the description of any of the&#xD;
      defined types of leukodystrophies and are therefore considered to have a leukodystrophy of&#xD;
      unknown cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to define groups of patients with leukodystrophies and to work&#xD;
      toward finding the cause of the disorders. In order to do this, researchers will analyze&#xD;
      patients with leukodystrophies of unknown causes. Patients will undergo clinical,&#xD;
      neurophysiologic, biochemical, and genetic examinations and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe that by studying these patients and their disorders they will be able to&#xD;
      better understand the causes of myelin destruction, and eventually lead to effective&#xD;
      treatments for these disorders.&#xD;

      Patients with leukodystrophies (LDs) of unknown etiology are a heterogeneous group but&#xD;
      constitute the second largest group of genetic white matter diseases. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to: (a) define novel homogeneous groups of patients with LDs and (b) work toward&#xD;
      finding the cause of these disorders. In order to achieve these goals, patients with LDs of&#xD;
      unknown cause will be analyzed clinically, neurophysiologically, biochemically and&#xD;
      genetically. Patients would have been diagnosed as having no known leukodystrophies at&#xD;
      outside centers. At the Clinical Center, such patients will undergo a series of&#xD;
      neuropsychological, blood, urine, spinal fluid, radiological, and peripheral tissue&#xD;
      pathological tests. Some of these tests will be part of a standard battery while others will&#xD;
      be tailored to individual patients. Patients will be followed for 3 years. Patients will be&#xD;
      screened for mutations in genes coding for structural myelin proteins. In some patients in&#xD;
      whom all tests yielded no information regarding the etiology of their disease, open brain&#xD;
      biopsy will be considered. Brain biopsy tissue will be evaluated using a novel combination of&#xD;
      approaches including detailed pathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of&#xD;
      myelin proteins and lipids. Oligodendroglial biology and expression of myelin genes in the&#xD;
      brain will also be investigated in situ. It is hoped that the present study will help clarify&#xD;
      the nosology of the leukodystrophies and significantly advance our understanding of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of these diseases.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Candidates for participation in the protocol will be patients of all ages with&#xD;
                  clinical and radiographic signs of leukodystrophy who do not have a specific&#xD;
                  etiology despite a previous comprehensive workup. The preceding investigation&#xD;
                  would have excluded the following: adrenoleukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy,&#xD;
                  metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, a well-defined&#xD;
                  amino acid organic acid disorder, or a systemic mitochondrial cytopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. First -degree relatives of patients with leukodystrophies of unknown etiology&#xD;
                  (father, mother, siblings, or sons and daughters of the patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Refusal to sign the protocol consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Candidates who are unable to travel to the National Institutes of Health Clinical&#xD;
             Center.&#xD;
