  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give adefovir (a new&#xD;
      anti-HIV drug) plus nelfinavir to HIV-infected children who are already receiving other&#xD;
      anti-HIV medications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the first phase of the study (Days 1-6), the safety and tolerability of multiple doses&#xD;
      of ADF is assessed when administered simultaneously with the patient's reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitor (RTI) regimen. The second phase begins on Day 7 when nelfinavir is added to the&#xD;
      therapy regimen for an additional 15 weeks. ADF pharmacokinetics are measured on Days 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 7 (on a subset of 18 patients); peak and trough samples are collected on Day 28.&#xD;
