  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a disease most commonly affecting the lungs, but it can also involve lymph&#xD;
      nodes, skin, liver, spleen, eyes, bones, and glands. The cause of the disease is unknown.&#xD;
      When it occurs it can produce an inflammatory reaction leading to irreversible organ damage&#xD;
      and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sarcoidosis granulomas can form in various organs (primarily lung) which can lead to its&#xD;
      dysfunction. Granuloma is formed by clusters of inflammatory cells. The formation of these&#xD;
      granulomas is influenced by the release of a substance called TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor alpha) which is found in some white blood cells. A drug known as pentoxifylline (POF)&#xD;
      is known to markedly reduce the release of TNF-alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard medical treatment for sarcoidosis is steroid therapy. However, steroid therapy&#xD;
      is associated with significant side effects and often must be stopped. Unfortunately, some of&#xD;
      these patients can relapse when the steroid therapy is discontinued. Because of this,&#xD;
      researchers are interested in finding alternative therapies for the treatment of sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of giving POF to patients with sarcoidosis&#xD;
      currently taking steroids. Researchers will compare the results between patients taking&#xD;
      steroids with pentoxifylline and those patients taking steroids alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corticosteroids are currently the mainstay of therapy for active pulmonary sarcoidosis and&#xD;
      are used to prevent relapses in many patients with stable disease. The pulmonary&#xD;
      manifestations of sarcoidosis are heterogenous and not all patients require corticosteroid&#xD;
      therapy. Corticosteroids often produce undesirable side effects and, therefore, other&#xD;
      therapies that can reduce or replace corticosteroid use are being sought. As tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a pivotal role in the formation of granulomata (the&#xD;
      pathological hallmark of the disease), drugs that inhibit its production/release may prove&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of this disease. Pentoxifylline (POF), a xanthine derivative used&#xD;
      for many years in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease, is known to inhibit TNF-alpha&#xD;
      release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and alveolar macrophages from patients&#xD;
      with active sarcoidosis. To evaluate whether this drug is beneficial in the treatment of&#xD;
      sarcoidosis, we propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with&#xD;
      POF in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis on corticosteroid therapy. The primary objective&#xD;
      of this study is to determine whether POF treatment can be beneficial as an adjunct to&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The role of TNF-alpha and&#xD;
      other cytokines (released from alveolar macrophages) in explaining treatment responses&#xD;
      defined by whether or not a patient improved will be assessed by testing whether the effect&#xD;
      of treatment on the probability of improvement varies with cytokine levels.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Admission to this protocol will require a diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis with or&#xD;
             without ocular sarcoidosis based on clinical history, and biopsy of either lung,&#xD;
             intrathoracic or other lymph nodes, or internal organs consistent with sarcoidosis,&#xD;
             with all other causes of granuloma ruled out. Prior to enrollment in the study,&#xD;
             patients will have their biopsy slides reviewed by a pathologist for confirmation of&#xD;
             the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Males or females between 18 and 70 years of age on corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with active sarcoidosis of major organs other than the lungs and eyes (e.g.,&#xD;
             central nervous system, cardiac, renal) that require corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, history of cerebral or&#xD;
             retinal hemorrhage, heart failure (New York class III or higher), renal failure (on&#xD;
             dialysis), liver failure (with portal hypertension and ascites), cancer EXCEPT&#xD;
             non-metastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, hematologic disorders,&#xD;
             including severe anemia (hemoglobin less than or equal to 7 g/dl), granulocytopenia,&#xD;
             platelet disorders, or a need for anticoagulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with concomitant obstructive lung disease (i.e., asthma, COPD, cystic&#xD;
             fibrosis) or other interstitial lung diseases since changes in pulmonary function in&#xD;
             such patients could not be attributed to sarcoidosis alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of child-bearing potential without an accepted method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a positive serum test for human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B or&#xD;
             C virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients incapable of giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients allergic to POF or methylxanthines such as caffeine, theophylline and&#xD;
             theobromine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients currently taking corticosteroids for disease other than pulmonary&#xD;
             sarcoidosis, theophylline, POF, or other xanthines, or patients who have been on these&#xD;
             drugs in the preceding three months.&#xD;
