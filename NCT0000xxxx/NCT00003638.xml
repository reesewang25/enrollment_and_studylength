      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells. It is not yet known whether THERATOPE vaccine therapy is more effective than standard&#xD;
      vaccine therapy in treating metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized double blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of THERATOPE&#xD;
      vaccine therapy with that of standard vaccine therapy in treating women who have metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare time to disease progression in patients receiving THERATOPE vaccine to&#xD;
      that of women receiving control vaccine. II. Compare survival in patients receiving THERATOPE&#xD;
      vaccine to that of patients receiving control vaccine. III. Document the product safety&#xD;
      profile in these patients. IV. Measure the anti-STn, anti-OSM, and anti-KLH antibody titers.&#xD;
      V. Evaluate the impact of THERATOPE STn-KLH vaccine on health-related quality of life in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: The study design is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized study. Patients who&#xD;
      have completed first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer and have either&#xD;
      nonprogressive disease or no evidence of disease following completion of first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy (includes bone marrow transplants and stem cell rescue) will be randomized to&#xD;
      either the THERATOPE vaccine or the control vaccine. Patients are stratified at entry&#xD;
      according to disease status (i.e., either no evidence of disease or nonprogressive disease)&#xD;
      and whether or not they are receiving hormonal therapy for metastatic disease while on study.&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive intravenous cyclophosphamide on day -3, followed by 4 subcutaneous&#xD;
      vaccinations with THERATOPE STn-KLH vaccine combined with Detox-B Stable Emulsion at 0, 2, 5,&#xD;
      and 9 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive the control treatment of intravenous cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      on day -3, followed by 4 subcutaneous vaccinations with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)&#xD;
      vaccine combined with Detox-B Stable Emulsion at 0, 2, 5, and 9 weeks. Patients with stable&#xD;
      or responding disease may receive the THERATOPE STn-KLH vaccine or control without Detox-B&#xD;
      Stable Emulsion at weeks 13, 17, 21, and 25. Patients without unacceptable toxic effects or&#xD;
      disease progression may continue on maintenance therapy at 3 month intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Over 120 sites in North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand will be&#xD;
      participating in the study. A total of 950 women (475 per treatment arm) will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
