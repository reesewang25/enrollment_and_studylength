  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is typically treated with surgery, radiation or a combination of both.&#xD;
      Following surgical removal of thyroid tissue patients receive thyroid hormone replacement&#xD;
      medication. In addition patients undergo tests to determine the status of the disease. One of&#xD;
      the tests conducted is a whole body scan using radioactive iodine to detect and locate any&#xD;
      remaining cancerous thyroid tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid tissue uses iodine to make thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). In order for a radioiodine&#xD;
      scan to work, cancerous thyroid tissue must be &quot;hungry&quot; for iodine. Thyroid stimulating&#xD;
      hormone (TSH) produced in the pituitary gland is responsible for making thyroid tissue&#xD;
      &quot;hungry&quot; for iodine. Once thyroid tissue absorbs the radioactive iodine it will be clearly&#xD;
      visible on the scan and can be located for removal. However, thyroid hormone replacement&#xD;
      medication tends to lower the activity of the pituitary gland and the amount of naturally&#xD;
      produced TSH. So it is necessary to stop thyroid hormone replacement to increase TSH. A&#xD;
      problem arises when there is a lack of thyroid hormone replacement causing patients to&#xD;
      experience hypothyroidism. This condition is associated with unpleasant physical and&#xD;
      emotional symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TSH has been created in a laboratory and called Thyrogen. It is basically the same as the TSH&#xD;
      produced in the human pituitary gland. However, Thyrogen increases the level of TSH in the&#xD;
      body without having to stop thyroid replacement medication. Therefore patients will not&#xD;
      experience hypothyroidism while preparing for a radioactive iodine scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the activity of radioiodine (131I) in patients&#xD;
      taking Thyrogen with normal thyroid activity versus patients with hypothyroid activity after&#xD;
      thyroid replacement medication is withdrawn. In addition the study will provide information&#xD;
      on how radioactive iodine is eliminated from the body. The study will help researchers&#xD;
      understand how to give Thyrogen and radioiodine for purposes of scanning and therapeutic&#xD;
      ablation (the destruction of function) of cancerous thyroid tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will accept patients with non-medullary thyroid cancer who are preparing for&#xD;
      ablation therapy. The patients will be placed in one of two groups. Group one will receive&#xD;
      Thyrogen in 2 doses 24 hours apart. Group two will receive Thyrogen in 3 doses 72 hours&#xD;
      apart. The patients will undergo two 131I whole body scans: one after Thyrogen while taking&#xD;
      thyroid hormone suppressive and the second after withdrawal from thyroid hormone. 131I&#xD;
      ablative therapy will be given under hypothyroid conditions at the completion of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centered, open-labeled, randomized, two parallel-arm study designed to&#xD;
      compare quantitative radiation dosimetry assessments obtained during thyroid hormone&#xD;
      suppression therapy with recombinant human TSH (Thyrogen速 (Registered Trademark)) and&#xD;
      hypothyroidism in thyroid cancer patients preparing for post-surgical radioiodine ablation.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is to identify the ratio of administered activity of&#xD;
      radioiodine (131I) to deliver a targeted dose of 30,000 rad to the thyroid remnant when&#xD;
      patients are euthyroid on Thyrogen速 (Registered Trademark) and hypothyroid after hormone&#xD;
      withdrawal. Secondary endpoints are to identify and compare effective 131I clearance and&#xD;
      cumulated activity in the whole body and blood during euthyroid and hypothyroid states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients with differentiated non-medullary thyroid cancer who are preparing for&#xD;
      ablation therapy are eligible for participation. Patients will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      different dosing regimens of Thyrogen速 (Registered Trademark). Participants will undergo two&#xD;
      131I whole body scans: one after Thyrogen速 (Registered Trademark) while taking thyroid&#xD;
      hormone suppressive therapy and the second after withdrawal from thyroid hormone. 131I&#xD;
      ablative therapy will be given under hypothyroid conditions at the completion of the&#xD;
      dosimetry study.&#xD;

        Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age, with well-differentiated, non-medullary&#xD;
        thyroid cancer, including papillary (including follicular-variant), follicular, and Hurthle&#xD;
        cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who recently have undergone a total or near-total thyroidectomy and are scheduled&#xD;
        to undergo initial 131I diagnostic studies and ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have evidence of residual thyroid tissue after thyroid surgery confirmed by&#xD;
        ultrasound or other imaging technique (e.g., a technetium [Tc 99] pertechnetate or thallium&#xD;
        scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have undergone thyroidectomy or other thyroid surgery at least 6 weeks prior&#xD;
        to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients who have been sustained on maintenance THST for at least 4 weeks, but not&#xD;
        longer than 12 weeks after thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients who have confirmed serum TSH levels less than or equal to 0.5 mU per liter&#xD;
        within 7 days prior to the first Thyrogen dose, and prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients of childbearing age must have a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
        (HCG) pregnancy test prior to entering the study and within 5 days of any 131I&#xD;
        administration and must be following an approved method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are committed to following the protocol requirements as evidenced by providing&#xD;
        written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients for whom a 131I scan is currently contraindicated because withdrawal from THST is&#xD;
        not an option due to pituitary dysfunction or other compelling medical reasons are&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not have a concurrent major medical disorder (e.g., documented cardiac&#xD;
        disease, debilitating cardiopulmonary disease, advanced renal failure, advanced liver&#xD;
        disease or advanced pulmonary disease) who may be too ill to adequately comply with the&#xD;
        requirements of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with non-thyroidal conditions known to effect 131I uptake (e.g., congestive heart&#xD;
        failure, renal failure) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not have undergone any intravenous water soluble radiographic contrast&#xD;
        administration within the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not have received intrathecal or cholecystographic iodinated contrast agent&#xD;
        administration within 3 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not be taking drugs that affect thyroid or renal function (e.g., renal&#xD;
        drugs, lithium, or corticosteroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not be participating in another investigational drug study or in such a&#xD;
        study within 30 days of their enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with a recent history of alcoholism or drug abuse, severe emotional behavioral&#xD;
        or psychiatric problems who, in the opinion of the investigator, would not be able to&#xD;
        comply with the requirements of this study.&#xD;
