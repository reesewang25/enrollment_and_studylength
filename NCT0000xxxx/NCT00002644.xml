    <textblock>
      The International Breast Cancer Intervention Study I (IBIS-I) was designed to investigate the&#xD;
      use of tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer in women with a higher risk of developing the&#xD;
      disease. Recruitment of women to IBIS-I ended in March 2001 and it recruited 7154 women from&#xD;
      36 centres in 9 countries. The results of the study showed that tamoxifen reduced the&#xD;
      incidence of breast cancer by one third in these high risk women but with some serious side&#xD;
      effects. IBIS-II was designed to continue the work started in IBIS-I by examining the role of&#xD;
      anastrozole in the prevention of breast cancer which we hope will reduce breast cancer by&#xD;
      even more than tamoxifen with less serious side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Established in 1992, the IBIS-I Study investigated the efficacy of tamoxifen (a hormonal drug&#xD;
      used to prevent breast cancer) versus a placebo drug (taken daily for five years) in terms of&#xD;
      reduction of breast cancer incidence in pre and postmenopausal women at high risk of&#xD;
      developing breast cancer. It was a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial that&#xD;
      recruited 7,154 women internationally (of which 4,277 were UK participants), aged 35-70&#xD;
      years. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of breast cancer, including ductal&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ (cancer cells in the lining of the breast milk duct) and side effects&#xD;
      present in the patients were also investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment to the study completed in 2001 and the intervention (placebo/tamoxifen) ended in&#xD;
      2007. In early 2008 the Research Ethics Committee (REC) approved the conversion of IBIS-I to&#xD;
      an epidemiological cohort study. During 2007-2016 participants were followed-up via an annual&#xD;
      postal questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2002, initial results found that tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by&#xD;
      31%. Mortality from non-breast cancer causes was not increased by tamoxifen. However, the&#xD;
      analysis concluded that the overall risk/benefit ratio for the use of tamoxifen in prevention&#xD;
      remained unclear and that continued follow-up of trial participants was essential. A 2007&#xD;
      analysis on long-term tamoxifen prophylaxis for breast cancer confirmed the preventive effect&#xD;
      of tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence and that this was constant for the entire&#xD;
      follow-up period. No reduction in size of benefit was observed for up to ten years following&#xD;
      participant randomisation. Additionally, tamoxifen-related side effects such as&#xD;
      thrombo-embolism were not increased anymore after the 5-year treatment period. These results&#xD;
      therefore demonstrate that the benefit-to-risk ratio of tamoxifen improves with increasing&#xD;
      duration of follow-up. Thus, how much additional benefit will be seen long-term remains an&#xD;
      important question.&#xD;
