    <textblock>
      This research protocol seeks to learn more about bipolar disorder in children and adolescents&#xD;
      ages 6-17. Researchers will describe the moods and behaviors of children with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder and use specialized testing and brain imaging to learn about specific brain changes&#xD;
      associated with the disorder. This protocol studies children who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, and those who have a sibling or parent with bipolar disorder and are thus&#xD;
      considered &quot;at risk&quot; for developing the disorder.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this protocol we define Bipolar Spectrum disorders (BSD) as the propensity to have a&#xD;
      manic episode by having Bipolar Disorder or Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related&#xD;
      Disorder. BSD in children and adolescents is receiving increased research attention, but&#xD;
      important questions remain about its developmental trajectory, phenomenology and behavioral&#xD;
      correlates, and little is known about its underlying neural mechanisms. In its study of youth&#xD;
      with BSD, this study has three objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to use longitudinal techniques to characterize the clinical and physiological&#xD;
           manifestations of pediatric BSD, and to use cross-sectional techniques (e.g., comparing&#xD;
           children and adults with BSD on these measures) to provide preliminary data to guide&#xD;
           such longitudinal studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to identify and follow longitudinally behavioral, neuropsychological,&#xD;
           neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical correlates of pediatric BSD, and compare to&#xD;
           children with chronic irritability and hyperarousal symptoms (severe mood dysregulation,&#xD;
           SMD, as outlined in protocol 02-M-0021), youth with attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
           disorder (ADHD), and typically developing youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to examine genetic and familial correlates of pediatric BSD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 11 separate populations being studied in this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children and adolescents between the ages of 6-17 years old who meet criteria for BSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adults between the ages of 18-58 years old who meet criteria for BD, including those age&#xD;
           18-25 with BSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control populations of: a) Healthy volunteer children and adolescents between the ages&#xD;
           of 3-17 years old, b) Parents of healthy volunteer children or healthy adults in&#xD;
           research, c) Children 8-17 years old with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
           (ADHD), who do not have a mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. First and second-degree biological relatives of those in (B.1) or (B.2), above, and are&#xD;
           between 3-58 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A subgroup of these cohorts will be Old Order Amish individuals who fulfill eligibility&#xD;
           for (1), (2), (3a), (3b), or (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children and adolescents with BSD (i.e. Bipolar Disorder or those with&#xD;
      Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder), this study is an outpatient&#xD;
      characterization and longitudinal follow-along design. Once determined to be eligible,&#xD;
      individuals come for an initial assessment, and then at varying intervals they return for&#xD;
      clinical interviews, behavioral tasks, and structural and functional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children and adolescents who are relatives of individuals with BSD, this is an outpatient&#xD;
      follow-along design during which individuals come for an outpatient assessment and at 2-year&#xD;
      intervals for clinical interviews, behavioral tasks, and structural and functional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy volunteer children, children with only ADHD, adults with BD, and parents of&#xD;
      healthy volunteer children, this study is an outpatient cross-sectional study that includes&#xD;
      clinical interviews, behavioral tasks, and structural and functional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all others, individuals come to NIH for clinical interviews, behavioral tasks, and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For most individuals in the Amish community, the investigation occurs in the field, where&#xD;
      they receive clinical interviews and behavioral tasks. Some may choose to come to the NIH to&#xD;
      participate in behavioral testing and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all individuals, genetic material from saliva or blood is obtained under protocol&#xD;
      01-M-0254.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine between group differences in clinical, behavioral, genetic,&#xD;
      neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological variables in individuals with BSD, their relatives,&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers. Findings in children with BSD will also be compared to those with&#xD;
      severe mood dysregulation, sometimes called a broad phenotype of pediatric BD, recruited&#xD;
      under protocol 02-M-0021 (Nottelman, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal clinical, behavioral, and neuroanatomical data will also be obtained.&#xD;
