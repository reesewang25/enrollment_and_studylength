      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was in response to a demonstration and education initiative, &quot;Improving&#xD;
      Hypertensive Care for Inner City Minorities&quot;, which was reviewed and approved by the Clinical&#xD;
      Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee in April 1992 and by the National Heart, Lung,&#xD;
      and Blood Advisory Council in May 1992. The Request for Applications was released in October&#xD;
      1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components of the program included a community education campaign, an educational&#xD;
      intervention for private physicians, and major modifications in the process of care for&#xD;
      hypertensives in a health care system that was the largest single provider to the target&#xD;
      area. The intervention area was compared to a similar community in another part of the city&#xD;
      which was served by different private and public providers. Pre- and post-intervention random&#xD;
      samples of persons ages 18-74 were selected from each geographical area to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the program in reducing the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension. The&#xD;
      community intervention focused on improving awareness and need to maintain treatment. The&#xD;
      private physician intervention focused on strategies for promoting long-term patient&#xD;
      adherence. The public hospital clinic/systems components were: 1) educating providers, 2)&#xD;
      instituting an evening clinic for the working poor, 3) providing tailored patient education&#xD;
      programs which were culturally sensitive and did not require class attendance, and 4)&#xD;
      implementing a program in the public hospital emergency center to identify and refer patients&#xD;
      with undetected hypertension or hypertension not under regular care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts, including reminders and follow-up by community health center social workers, were&#xD;
      used to keep patients active in treatment programs. The community intervention was directed&#xD;
      by the co-investigator from Texas Southern University (TSU), an historically Black university&#xD;
      located in the intervention area. He had extensive experience in community outreach. The&#xD;
      intervention toward private physicians was directed by investigators from Baylor College of&#xD;
      Medicine who had established clinical credibility in the physician community. The&#xD;
      investigators from Baylor also had direct supervision over the physicians who provided care&#xD;
      in the Harris County Hospital District (HCHD) public health care system. The HCHD was deeply&#xD;
      committed to the project and had a high level of representation in all the planning phases.&#xD;
