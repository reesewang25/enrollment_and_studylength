      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Create a clinical sample bank of neonates with lung disease to test hypotheses regarding&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether a developmental deficiency of surfactant protein B (SP-B) contributes&#xD;
      to the occurrence of respiratory distress and BPD in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study metabolic abnormalities associated with inherited deficiency of SP-B in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine whether plasma nitrotyrosine levels, a marker of peroxynitrite mediated oxidant&#xD;
      stress, are elevated in premature infants who develop BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Measure the temporal changes in critical components of the inflammatory process (cell&#xD;
      composition, inducible nitric oxide synthase, hyaluronan (HA), receptor for HA mediated&#xD;
      mobility, and selected cytokines) in bronchoalveolar lavage, blood, and urine samples&#xD;
      obtained from these patients, and to correlate these changes with their clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Examine changes in the insulin-like growth factor axis that occur in the lungs of infants&#xD;
      with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine the relationship between degradation of elastin and the clinical course of&#xD;
      BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Determine whether the normal fall in plasma endothelin-1 concentrations after birth are&#xD;
      delayed in infants with RDS and BPD.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar lavage and urine samples are obtained from patients on day of life 0, 1, 3,&#xD;
      7, 14, 21, and 28, and every 2 weeks thereafter until the infant is extubated. Serial blood&#xD;
      samples are obtained from patients on day of life 0 (cord blood if possible), 1, 3, 7, 14,&#xD;
      and 28, and prior to hospital discharge. Infants who require supplemental oxygen beyond 28&#xD;
      days of life will have 3 additional blood samples obtained at 6, 8, and 12 weeks of life.&#xD;
      Those infants with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia who are admitted to the hospital at&#xD;
      over 4 weeks of age have plasma samples obtained at the time of admission, and every 2 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter for a maximum total of 5 samples.&#xD;
