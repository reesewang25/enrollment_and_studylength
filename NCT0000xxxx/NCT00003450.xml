      RATIONALE: Inserting the p53 gene into a person's cancer cells may improve the body's ability&#xD;
      to fight cancer or make the cancer more sensitive to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy using the p53 gene in&#xD;
      treating patients with advanced recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cavity cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicities of intraperitoneal&#xD;
      adenoviral p53 gene therapy in patients with advanced, recurrent, or persistent ovarian&#xD;
      carcinoma. II. Evaluate the vector pharmacokinetics and biologic efficacy of gene transfer,&#xD;
      gene expression, and cell death in these patients. III. Determine the immunologic response to&#xD;
      therapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of adenoviral p53 gene therapy. Patients undergo&#xD;
      removal of ascites, if present, from the peritoneal cavity followed by a bolus infusion of&#xD;
      adenovirus p53 once a week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2 week rest. Treatment&#xD;
      continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who experience palliative results with at least stable disease may continue&#xD;
      treatment weekly without the rest period. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each level&#xD;
      of adenovirus p53. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level below that at&#xD;
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients who receive the MTD without&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity may continue to receive treatment on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued over 16-18 months for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
