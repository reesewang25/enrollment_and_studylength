    <textblock>
      This study of inflammatory muscle diseases-polymyositis and dermatomyositis and related&#xD;
      disorders-will examine what causes these diseases and describe the clinical features (signs&#xD;
      and symptoms) associated with them. Inflammation and degeneration of skeletal muscles in&#xD;
      these disorders leads to weakness and muscle wasting. The skin, lungs and other organs may&#xD;
      also be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 16 years of age and older with polymyositis, dermatomyositis, or a related disorder&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo a complete history and physical&#xD;
      examination, including routine blood and urine tests. Additional procedures for diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment or research may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood sample for genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle biopsy-removal of a tissue sample for microscopic examination. Under local&#xD;
           anesthetic, a 1/2- to 1-inch long incision is made in the thigh or upper arm, and a&#xD;
           small piece of muscle is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Electromyography-measurement of the electrical activity of a muscle. A needle is&#xD;
           inserted through the skin into a muscle to record its electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Magnetic resonance imaging-visualization of organs or tissues, using a magnetic field&#xD;
           and radio waves. The patient lies on a table inside a narrow cylinder (the MRI scanner)&#xD;
           with a strong magnetic field for the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Manual muscle strength testing by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Swallowing studies using ultrasound (imaging using sound waves) and X-rays (barium&#xD;
           swallow) to evaluate swallowing and speaking abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Questionnaires on swallowing ability and ability to perform daily living activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Pulmonary function tests-measurement of movement of air in and out of the lungs. The&#xD;
           patient breathes into a machine to evaluate lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Chest X-rays to evaluate lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Electrocardiogram and, if necessary, Holter monitoring (measurement of the electrical&#xD;
           activity of the heart) and echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging of the heart) to evaluate&#xD;
           heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Apheresis-collection of white blood cells for research. Whole blood is collected through&#xD;
           a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it&#xD;
           into its components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned&#xD;
           to the body through the same needle or through a second one placed in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. MR guided muscle biopsy-measurement of glycogen in muscle tissue using magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging. Certain patients may undergo this experimental procedure to compare&#xD;
           MRI findings with those of muscle biopsy. The affected muscles are identified using MRI&#xD;
           and the biopsy incision is made. MRI is then used to guide the biopsy needle to the&#xD;
           muscle and a small piece is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible for experimental treatment studies will be offered the opportunity&#xD;
      to join them. Others will be advised of treatment recommendations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polymyositis, dermatomyositis and related disorders, also known as the idiopathic&#xD;
      inflammatory myopathies (IIM), are an uncommon, heterogeneous group of diseases. This is an&#xD;
      omnibus protocol designed to continue our description of this rare group of diseases, further&#xD;
      delineate important groups of patients, and obtain useful material for further study of&#xD;
      immunological abnormalities, pathogenesis and etiology of IIM. Often the diagnosis of an IIM&#xD;
      can be confused with other illness (such as adult-onset dystrophies), and therefore, we will&#xD;
      be evaluating patients with other illnesses (who are referred with a preliminary diagnosis of&#xD;
      an IIM) (1). Patients evaluated with IIM will receive (with informed consent) the best&#xD;
      standard therapies available and consideration for entry into any therapeutic protocols. MRI&#xD;
      will be performed on healthy volunteers to help develop a mathematical method for&#xD;
      quantitating edema of muscle MRI in patients (2). MRI/PET will be performed on some patients&#xD;
      and on healthy volunteers to evaluate its role in understanding muscle disease.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All eligible patients are invited to participate in this protocol. Patients are adults and&#xD;
        minors, aged 16 or higher, with possible idiopathic muscle disease (suspected or&#xD;
        confirmed). Since both men and women are affected with the disease, both sexes will be&#xD;
        studied. All ethnic and racial groups are at risk and will be included. Pregnant women and&#xD;
        women who intend to become pregnant during the study will be eligible since this disease&#xD;
        affects both segments of the population. This protocol proposes responsible inclusion of&#xD;
        pregnant women and the justification for this derives in part from the fact that women (who&#xD;
        are suffering from autoimmune and rheumatic diseases) lack data from which to make informed&#xD;
        decisions about health care during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF PREGNANT WOMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The majority of patients with autoimmune disease are women and of these individuals, the&#xD;
        majority are of childbearing age. Furthermore, pregnancy is a risk factor for fluctuations&#xD;
        in autoimmune disease activity, including organ- and life- threatening flares. The majority&#xD;
        of our study population is comprised of women. The exclusion of women who become pregnant&#xD;
        from systemic study by way of our natural history protocol, threatens both the well-being&#xD;
        of the individual women (owing to the standard of care provision of the protocol) and the&#xD;
        systematic discovery of pregnancy-specific data concerning the immunopathological basis of&#xD;
        autoimmune disease. Skewed understanding from a restricted natural history study may leave&#xD;
        vulnerable groups open to disproportionate harm owing to inequities in research. In other&#xD;
        words, automatic disqualification due to pregnancy denies women agency in the issue of&#xD;
        gender equity for access to research and in addition the systematic exclusion of pregnant&#xD;
        women prevents generalizability of information to help under-resourced and marginalized&#xD;
        populations, nationwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In summary,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cost of exclusion of pregnant women with myositis 1) insufficient evidence&#xD;
             concerning how to manage such disease for the population, and 2) lack of access to the&#xD;
             best myositis specific advice for individuals enrolled in the protocol who are&#xD;
             unlikely to have access to specialty care outside of the NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cost of exclusion in research with regard to fetal safety derives from the fact&#xD;
             that preeclampsia, eclampsia, preterm birth and miscarriage are higher in women who do&#xD;
             not have access to subspecialty care. In this situation, reticence on the part of&#xD;
             nonspecialists to treat active autoimmune disease during pregnancy or lack of access&#xD;
             to appropriate treatment may lead to harm to women and their fetuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The pregnant body possesses a unique hormonal and immunological environment.&#xD;
             Similarly, it metabolizes medications in a manner different from non-pregnant women,&#xD;
             let alone men. Hence, there is no reasonable path towards generating important&#xD;
             biomedical knowledge other than to include pregnant women in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The tension between protection by exclusion and the presumption of inclusion in research&#xD;
        protocols has been specifically addressed by the US Institute of Medicine (now National&#xD;
        Academy of Medicine) and the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and&#xD;
        Lactating Women to advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding gaps in&#xD;
        knowledge and research on safe and effective therapies for pregnant and lactating women,&#xD;
        and both have both weighed in as favoring the presumption of inclusion&#xD;
        (https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/advisory/PRGLAC). Our study falls in line with these&#xD;
        position papers since it is responsible (it benefits, patients and their fetuses and&#xD;
        provides relevant data to the population at large) and because it is low risk (it is&#xD;
        standard of care, only, and does not invoke experimental interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers will be eligible only if they are adults aged 18 or older and only if&#xD;
        they are willing to provide informed consent. There is no benefit to the healthy&#xD;
        volunteers; however their inclusion will provide invaluable information in comparison to&#xD;
        the patients for the purpose of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of NIH Staff or family members of study team members&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH staff and family members of study team members may be enrolled in this study as this&#xD;
        population meets the study entry criteria. Neither participation nor refusal to participate&#xD;
        as a subject in the research will have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the&#xD;
        participant s employment or position at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Every effort will be made to protect participant information, but such information may be&#xD;
        available in medical records and may be available to authorized users outside of the study&#xD;
        team in both an identifiable an unidentifiable manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The NIH Information Sheet on NIH Staff Research Participation will be made available.&#xD;
        Please see section for consent of NIH Staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children (age less than 16 years) are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with severe active infection (such as requiring intravenous antibiotics) or&#xD;
             other co-morbidities that in the opinion of the investigator would warrant exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects or their legal guardians who are unable or unwilling to give informed&#xD;
             consent/assent.&#xD;
