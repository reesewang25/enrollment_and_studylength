  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of using culture and staining techniques to quantify tissue&#xD;
      Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) burden in bone marrow. To correlate and compare changes in&#xD;
      MAC bone marrow burden with quantitative MAC blood culture results at baseline and after 4&#xD;
      and 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAC is easiest to detect in the blood, although doctors generally believe that MAC in blood&#xD;
      is just &quot;spill-over&quot; from infection of other parts of the body. Traditionally, studies of&#xD;
      potential treatments for MAC focus only on MAC changes in the blood. This study compares MAC&#xD;
      changes in blood to those in bone marrow, which is another tissue where MAC is often found.&#xD;

      changes in blood to those in bone marrow, which is another tissue where MAC is often found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive both clarithromycin and ethambutol for 48 weeks; those who become intolerant&#xD;
      to the study drugs may receive suggested substitute drugs (azithromycin and rifabutin).&#xD;
      Patients receive a bone marrow biopsy at baseline and at either 4 or 8 weeks. Patients are&#xD;
      evaluated at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48.&#xD;
