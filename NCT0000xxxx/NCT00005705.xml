      To evaluate three adherence promoting interventions within the Childhood Asthma Management&#xD;
      Program (CAMP), an eight center clinical trial that compared pediatric asthma therapies in&#xD;
      children five to twelve years old.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of any therapeutic intervention, whether preventive or curative, is ultimately&#xD;
      dependent on the individual's adherence to treatment. Unfortunately, the failure of a large&#xD;
      percentage of patients to adhere to prescribed medical regimens is a widely recognized and&#xD;
      well documented phenomenon. It has been estimated that as many as 50 percent of patients do&#xD;
      not take their prescribed medications, and of those remaining, less than two-thirds take&#xD;
      their medication as prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of a two grant initiative, &quot;Evaluation of Adherence Interventions in&#xD;
      Clinical Trials&quot;, developed by the Behavioral Medicine Branch staff and the Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Branch staff and by members of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee&#xD;
      Behavioral Medicine and Prevention Working Groups. The initiative, jointly sponsored by the&#xD;
      NHLBI and the National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR), was released in September 1991 and&#xD;
      awarded in September 1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants medication adherence was measured by self-report, canister weighing, and&#xD;
      with the Nebulizer Chronolog, a microprocessor-based monitor of inhaler adherence that&#xD;
      recorded the date and time of each inhaler use. The subjects were assigned to one of three&#xD;
      adherence treatment groups; a control condition, an informed condition, and a feedback&#xD;
      condition. Adherence outcomes were analyzed with respect to treatment assignment, as well as&#xD;
      CAMP measures of asthma morbidity, pulmonary function, medication side effects, psychosocial&#xD;
      development, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness analyses were also conducted.&#xD;
