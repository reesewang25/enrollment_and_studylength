      To address the public health importance of sleep disordered breathing and ultimately reduce&#xD;
      morbidity through information gained from longitudinal, population-based, epidemiologic&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have shown that undiagnosed sleep disordered breathing is prevalent for&#xD;
      both men and women throughout the range of middle age; multidisciplinary research findings&#xD;
      suggest that untreated sleep disordered breathing may lead to significant behavioral and&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity. The relative risks are of direct application to public health&#xD;
      estimates of: How much behavioral and cardiovascular morbidity would be eliminated if&#xD;
      prevalence of untreated sleep disordered breathing were significantly reduced? How much&#xD;
      reduction in sleep disordered breathing prevalence could be achieved by eliminating the&#xD;
      modifiable etiologic factors? Should high risk groups be targeted for early detection of risk&#xD;
      factor reduction programs?&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study quantified the etiologic role of hypothesized risk factors for sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing, described progression of the pathophysiologic process, and tested causal&#xD;
      hypotheses of adverse health outcomes. The study was conducted on a unique, established&#xD;
      cohort of over 800 subjects, representative of middle-aged employed adults. Extensive&#xD;
      baseline polysomnographic and other data were available on the established cohort of 800&#xD;
      subjects; additional cohorts of 50 perimenopausal women and 200 older adults were added for&#xD;
      maximum study power. The research resulted in longitudinal data, over a 5-9 year period, on&#xD;
      multiple parameters of sleep, breathing, risk factors and outcomes. The independent relative&#xD;
      risks were calculated with multivariate techniques to express the temporal relationships for&#xD;
      sleep disordered breathing etiologic factors and for consequences of sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 1993 and used longitudinal studies to focus on specific questions of&#xD;
      greatest relevance to public health, namely: the roles of aging and menopause in the&#xD;
      development of sleep-disordered breathing and the effect of sleep disordered breathing on&#xD;
      hypersomnolence and systemic hypertension.&#xD;
