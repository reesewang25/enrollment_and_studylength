    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to gain additional knowledge about what causes type 1&#xD;
      and type 2 Usher syndrome-inherited diseases that can cause balance problems and impaired&#xD;
      hearing and vision-and to develop better diagnostic tests. Patients with type 1 Usher&#xD;
      syndrome usually are deaf from birth and have speech and balance problems. Patients with type&#xD;
      2 disease generally are hearing impaired but have no balance problems. All patients develop&#xD;
      eye problems that cause difficulty seeing in the dark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of newer and more sophisticated diagnostic tests may detect subtle&#xD;
      differences in signs and symptoms that allow more accurate distinction between the two types&#xD;
      of Usher syndrome. This study will use these tests to classify these syndromes and eventually&#xD;
      identify the genes responsible for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will have a medical and family history taken and a family tree&#xD;
      constructed. They will undergo a thorough eye examination, including special tests of color&#xD;
      vision, field of vision, and ability to see in the dark. An electroretinogram will be done to&#xD;
      measure the function of cells in the retina, and a procedure called fluorescein angiography&#xD;
      will be done to look at and photograph the blood vessels in the retina. Special hearing and&#xD;
      balance tests will also done. Hearing tests include physical examination of the ears and&#xD;
      wearing earphones while listening to tones. Balance and coordination tests require tasks such&#xD;
      as walking in a straight line and standing in the dark with eyes closed. A caloric&#xD;
      stimulation test will also be done, in which a small amount of water is irrigated into the&#xD;
      ear canal. For gene studies, blood samples will be collected from patients and all available&#xD;
      family members.&#xD;

      The Usher Syndromes (USH), characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, are&#xD;
      genotypically distinct diseases which share specific phenotypic characteristics. Affected&#xD;
      individuals have congenital neurosensory hearing impairment of variable severity and a&#xD;
      progressive pigmentary retinal degeneration commonly referred to as retinitis pigmentosa.&#xD;
      Interfamilial differences in USH patients are greater than intrafamilial differences and&#xD;
      investigators have proposed at least two distinct phenotype types; Usher Syndrome type 1 (USH&#xD;
      1) and Usher Syndrome type 2 (USH 2) (Fishman 1983). Patients with USH 1 are profoundly deaf&#xD;
      from birth, have unintelligible speech and absent vestibular function. Nightblindness is&#xD;
      apparent in the 1st or 2nd decade accompanied by an extinguished electroretinogram (ERG) and&#xD;
      profound loss of visual field. Patients with USH 2 can have moderate to severe hearing loss&#xD;
      and normal vestibular function. Nightblindness occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decade, there is&#xD;
      variable field loss and variable response by the ERG (Fishman 1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heterogeneity has been verified by linkage studies and at least three USH 1 loci and two USH&#xD;
      2 loci are known (Kimberling et al 1990; Lewis et al 1990; Kaplan et al 1992; Smith et al&#xD;
      1992a.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      With increasingly sophisticated clinical testing, subtle differences may permit a more&#xD;
      accurate distinction between the two USH phenotypes. The purpose of this study is to classify&#xD;
      as accurately as possible these patients' clinical features by careful audiologic,&#xD;
      vestibular, psychophysical and electrodiagnostic testing and correlate these with the genetic&#xD;
      mutations identified through linkage studies and eventually to the genes (genetic mutations)&#xD;
      as they become identified.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have documentation of neurosensory hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa&#xD;
             and fulfill the clinical characteristics (Table) as accepted for USH 1 and USH 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The minimal test battery will identify all patients with USH 1 and USH 2 as well as&#xD;
             possible subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates will be recruited from lists of patients willing to participate in research&#xD;
             studies compiled by the R.P. Foundation, and by referral from their private&#xD;
             physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On occasion additional family members will be studied after an initial individual is&#xD;
             ascertained as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No patients with intrauterine and childhood infections, and intrauterine and birth&#xD;
             complications can result in trauma to both the auditory or visual system and a&#xD;
             positive history for these conditions will necessitate exclusion from the study.&#xD;
