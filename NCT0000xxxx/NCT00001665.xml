  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The problems in motor activity associated with Parkinson's disease are still poorly&#xD;
      understood. Patients with Parkinson's disease often suffer from extremely slow movements&#xD;
      (bradykinesia) which result in the inability to perform complex physical acts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging studies of the brain have provided researchers with information about the specific&#xD;
      areas in the brain associated with these motor difficulties. One particular area involved is&#xD;
      the surface of the brain called the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can be used to&#xD;
      stimulate brain activity and gather information about brain function. It is very useful when&#xD;
      studying the areas of the brain related to motor activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract,&#xD;
      and corpus callosum). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the&#xD;
      placement of a cooled electromagnet with a figure-eight coil on the patient's scalp and&#xD;
      rapidly turning on and off the magnetic flux. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized&#xD;
      stimulation of the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      varies, depending upon the location, intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers plan to study the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) on complex motor behavior of patients with Parkinson's disease. In order&#xD;
      to measure its effectiveness, patients will be asked to perform complex tasks, such as&#xD;
      playing the piano while receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation.&#xD;

      The physiology of the motor disturbance in Parkinson's disease is not completely understood.&#xD;
      One of the major and perhaps most disabling manifestations of PD is bradykinesia. It is&#xD;
      particularly difficult for these patients to perform simultaneous, sequential and complex&#xD;
      motor acts. Imaging studies have recently provided important information in reference to the&#xD;
      brain regions associated with performance of these motor sequences in normal volunteers and&#xD;
      in PD patients. These studies helped us to identify the brain regions active in association&#xD;
      with task performance. It has been suggested that cortical regions, and particularly the SMA&#xD;
      are less active in patients with PD than in controls in association with motor performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study the effects of subthreshold rTMS delivered to SMA and primary motor cortex&#xD;
      in patients with PD &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; medication. From this study, we expect to learn if&#xD;
      stimulation of the scalp overlying primary motor cortex and SMA can ameliorate performance of&#xD;
      simple and complex motor sequences in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subthreshold rTMS has been proposed as a therapeutic tool in psychiatric disorders. In the&#xD;
      motor domain, subthreshold rTMS delivered to primary motor cortex improves reaction times and&#xD;
      motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease. The mechanisms underlying this&#xD;
      beneficial effect are not known. However, they may be related with subthreshold rTMS&#xD;
      replacing the missing excitatory drive on the motor cortex.&#xD;
