      This study will determine if blood levels of anti-HIV drugs in pregnant women change at&#xD;
      different stages of pregnancy and if these changes require dosage adjustments in order to&#xD;
      maintain adequate drug levels during pregnancy. Anti-HIV medications are recommended for&#xD;
      HIV-infected women during pregnancy not only to treat their infection, but also to reduce the&#xD;
      chance of passing the virus to the baby during pregnancy. Changes in the body that occur&#xD;
      during pregnancy may affect how the body uses and eliminates these drugs, reducing their&#xD;
      levels during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women 18 years of age or older who are infected with HIV may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will have a medical history and physical examination, pregnancy test and&#xD;
      blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center once every 6 to 12 weeks until around their&#xD;
      34th week (8 months) of pregnancy and then again at least 1 month after the birth of the baby&#xD;
      to have blood drawn. A catheter (thin plastic tube) will be placed in a vein to avoid&#xD;
      multiple needle sticks for blood sampling during the day. The first sample will be collected&#xD;
      before the patient takes the morning doses of anti-HIV medicines and additional samples will&#xD;
      be drawn at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after taking the medication. A urine sample will also be&#xD;
      collected at each visit.&#xD;

      Highly active antiretroviral therapy is currently recommended for HIV-1 infected pregnant&#xD;
      women for the management of maternal HIV infection and for prevention of perinatal HIV&#xD;
      transmission. Many physiological changes occur during pregnancy may lead to changes in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of drugs. Some of these pharmacokinetic changes may include increases in&#xD;
      volume of distribution and total body clearance as well as decreases in oral absorption, area&#xD;
      under the concentration time curve, peak and trough concentrations. All of these changes may&#xD;
      result in decrease in drug exposure. Other than zidovudine, little is known about the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of other antiretroviral agents during pregnancy. A number of studies have&#xD;
      suggested a correlation between trough concentration: IC50 ratio and virological responses.&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to examine the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents during&#xD;
      different stages of pregnancy in comparison with the non-pregnant state (post-partum and&#xD;
      historical control). HIV infected pregnant women in general good health who are on at least&#xD;
      three antiretroviral drug combination will be enrolled in the study. Pharmacokinetic profiles&#xD;
      of the antiretroviral agents taken by the subjects will be obtained two to four times during&#xD;
      pregnancy and again at around one month post-partum. These data will be used to assess the&#xD;
      need for dosage adjustment or therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretroviral agents during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
