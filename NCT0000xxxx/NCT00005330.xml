      To identify early childhood determinants of eating and exercise behaviors that relate to&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While dietary and physical activity habits are known to relate to cardiovascular risk, in&#xD;
      1985 little data were available on factors that influence the development of such behaviors&#xD;
      early in life. In 1987, 106 families with 3 to 5 year old children were recruited to take&#xD;
      part in the Framingham Children's Study. The children and their parents are direct&#xD;
      descendents (4th and 3rd generation, respectively) of participants in the Framingham Heart&#xD;
      Study. During the initial grant period, the feasibility of collecting relevant data has been&#xD;
      demonstrated. Maintenance of the cohort and acceptance of the monitoring procedures have been&#xD;
      excellent, due partly to the fact that the families consider themselves a part of the&#xD;
      Framingham Heart Study and take pride in long-term compliance with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have been following 100 families who are 3rd and 4th generation descendants&#xD;
      of the original Framingham Heart Study cohort. The subjects were age 3-5 years at the onset&#xD;
      of the study and were ages 11-14 years in 1996. There has been excellent cohort maintenance&#xD;
      with over 90 percent of the original families continuing to participate. The study was&#xD;
      renewed in FY 1996 to extend the Framingham Children's Study (FCS) to permit the evaluation&#xD;
      of the determinants of change in the child's risk behaviors and other risk factors from early&#xD;
      childhood through puberty to mid to late teens, a time when the individual's risk profile&#xD;
      should better reflect his/her cardiovascular risk status as an adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FCS is a longitudinal source of data on diet, activity and family and environmental&#xD;
      factors in children. By 1996, the investigators had collected extensive dietary data with an&#xD;
      average of 32 days of diet records and almost 50 days of electronically monitored physical&#xD;
      activity data for each subject. Additional data included psychosocial and anthropometric data&#xD;
      on children and their parents. The extension of the FCS allows continued monitoring of eating&#xD;
      behaviors and physical activity habits of the children and their parents, as well as the&#xD;
      personal environmental and behavioral factors influencing changes in the child's physical&#xD;
      activity, diet, blood pressure, lipids and obesity from pre-school into the late teen years.&#xD;
