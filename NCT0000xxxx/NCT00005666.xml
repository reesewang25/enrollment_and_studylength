  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study for patients with inoperable lung cancer called non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). Currently, the information from a radiological test, computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scan of the chest, is used to design the best arrangement of radiation beams which will kill&#xD;
      tumor cells and still spare the normal parts of lungs and other normal organs in the chest.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether adding information from another radiological&#xD;
      test, called positron emission tomography (PET), will improve the accuracy of the radiation&#xD;
      beam arrangement designed to treat lung cancer. A PET scan is a way to picture the&#xD;
      biochemistry of tissues and organs: of how tissues in the body take up glucose, a normal&#xD;
      nutrient of the body. The researchers will attempt to create radiation treatment plans from&#xD;
      PET images alone and compare differences between hypothetical plans and standard-of-care&#xD;
      CT-based radiation treatment plans. Because there is honest uncertainty about the&#xD;
      contribution of PET to radiation treatment planning, it is possible that there will be no&#xD;
      difference between a CT-based treatment plan and one resulting from PET information. It is&#xD;
      also possible that the addition of PET may result in a radiation beam arrangement that may&#xD;
      better control lung cancer. The addition of PET may also result in treating less normal&#xD;
      tissues, which may lower the risk of radiation side effects. This study will provide the&#xD;
      preliminary data necessary to design a larger clinical trial that may define the role of PET&#xD;
      in radiation treatment planning.&#xD;
