  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD) is a sporadic disorder which affects multiple sites in&#xD;
      the skeleton. The bone at these sites is rapidly resorbed and replaced by abnormal fibrous&#xD;
      tissue or mechanically abnormal bone. PFD may occur alone or as part of the McCune-Albright&#xD;
      Syndrome (MAS), a syndrome originally defined by the triad of PFD, cafe-au-lait pigmentation&#xD;
      of the skin, and precocious puberty. The bony lesions are frequently disfiguring, disabling&#xD;
      and painful, and depending on the location of the lesion, can cause significant morbidity.&#xD;
      Lesions in weight-bearing bones can lead to disabling fractures, while lesions in the skull&#xD;
      can lead to compression of vital structures such as cranial nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of this disease is poorly described and there are no clearly defined&#xD;
      systemic therapies for the bone disease. This is a data collection and specimen acquisition&#xD;
      protocol. The purpose of the study is to define the natural history of the disease by&#xD;
      following PFD/MAS subjects over time and by using in vitro experimentation with&#xD;
      samples/tissue from subjects with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           Define the natural history of disease by gaining clinical and basic information about&#xD;
           PFD/MAS by following subjects clinically and using in vitro experimentation with tissue&#xD;
           from subjects with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refer eligible subjects for enrollment into other appropriate research protocols, if any are&#xD;
      currently active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects with known or suspected Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia (PFD) or in combination&#xD;
           with McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be accepted regardless of gender, race, or&#xD;
           ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational/natural history study of PFD/MAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Successfully enroll subjects with PFD or MAS for the collection, evaluation and analysis&#xD;
           of data obtained from clinical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain onsite and offsite research tissue (waste tissue) from patients with PFD/MAS that&#xD;
           are enrolled onto this study or from individuals with PFD/MAS that are offsite and&#xD;
           willing to donate waste tissue to NIH. Research tissue will be used with existing&#xD;
           primary cell culture technology (ongoing in our laboratories) to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  understand the basic bone biology of the pathologic cell (or cells) involved in the&#xD;
                lesions of PFD/MAS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  determine the presence or absence of mutated cells at &quot;uninvolved sites&quot; to&#xD;
                formulate better strategies of predicting the initiation of new lesions, the&#xD;
                natural history of lesion progression and/or response to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  understand osteogenic differentiation, in particular, the role of G(s)alpha in&#xD;
                these lesions, which will be transferable to our understanding of bone biology in&#xD;
                general&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  understand the pathophysiology of FD and/or endocrine lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  develop better methods of identifying and expanding unaffected bone cells from&#xD;
                patients with PFD in an effort to create better grafting material(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify and predict clinical and biological behavior of fibrous dysplastic bone lesions&#xD;
           based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  stability, rate of growth, rate of change, progression and regression, and&#xD;
                development of new lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  differences between cranial, axial and appendicular lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Define the natural history of the multiple endocrinopathies associated with MAS and the&#xD;
           response to standard of care medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Define clinical and biological aspects of the disease not previously identified&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Generate future research studies related to PFD alone or in combination with MAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Successfully enroll eligible subjects into active research protocols applicable to the&#xD;
      FD/MAS population.&#xD;
