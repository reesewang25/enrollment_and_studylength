      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of an initiative &quot;Interventions to Improve Asthma Management and&#xD;
      Prevention at School&quot;. The Broad Agency Announcement was released in June, 1994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had several objectives. The first was to demonstrate that a comprehensive&#xD;
      school-based asthma education program could be implemented, using existing resources, in a&#xD;
      largely poor, inner city educational environment. The second objective was to provide broad&#xD;
      information on asthma and its management to elementary school faculties in order to help&#xD;
      reduce fear and anxiety due to lack of knowledge about asthma. The third was to provide&#xD;
      curriculum-based information about asthma to the general student bodies of elementary&#xD;
      schools. The fourth objective was to institute a cost effective screening program that would&#xD;
      identify elementary school students with asthma. The fifth was to provide an education&#xD;
      program designed to improve knowledge and prevention. The sixth was to develop an individual&#xD;
      asthma action plan for students with asthma that would improve their management and&#xD;
      prevention skills and to coordinate the individual asthma action plan with school personnel&#xD;
      and activities in order to improve support for the students in following their management&#xD;
      plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program was evaluated through a randomized controlled design with the schools as the unit&#xD;
      of randomization and the students the unit of analysis. The Birmingham public schools were&#xD;
      divided into three cohorts of 18 schools each on the basis of geographic location. Schools&#xD;
      were randomly assigned within cohorts so that nine schools were experimental and nine were&#xD;
      control. The research protocol was implemented in the first cohort in the fall of 1995, in&#xD;
      the second cohort in the fall of 1996, and in the third cohort in the fall of 1997. Students&#xD;
      with asthma were followed for three school terms following collection of baseline data and&#xD;
      implementation of the education program. Outcomes were assessed in terms of school absences&#xD;
      and performance, health care utilization, quality of life and asthma morbidity during school.&#xD;
