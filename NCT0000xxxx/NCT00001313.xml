  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers will admit and evaluate patients with known or suspected heart&#xD;
      disease referred to the Cardiology Branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&#xD;
      (NHLBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will undergo a general medical evaluation, including&#xD;
      blood tests, urine, examination, chest x-ray and electrocardiogram (EKG). In addition,&#xD;
      patients may be asked to have an echocardiogram (ultrasound scan of the heart) and to perform&#xD;
      an exercise stress test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests are designed to assess the types and causes of patient's heart diseases and to&#xD;
      determine if they can participate in other, specific research studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal mission of the NIH is the conduct of research that elucidates biological&#xD;
      mechanisms, pathogenesis, and treatment of disease. Patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases are referred to NHLBI cardiologists for consideration of&#xD;
      participation in clinical research protocols. However, eligibility for participation is often&#xD;
      uncertain from referral information or even after an outpatient evaluation. The purpose of&#xD;
      this protocol is to permit inpatient evaluation of patients for whom participation in&#xD;
      clinical research protocols is under consideration in order to determine protocol eligibility&#xD;
      by means of conventional laboratory and cardiovascular testing.&#xD;
