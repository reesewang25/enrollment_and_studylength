      To determine if participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who were assigned to&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids had a lower rate of decline in lung function and lower incidence of&#xD;
      respiratory morbidity compared to participants assigned to placebo.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the fourth leading cause of death in the United&#xD;
      States and a major cause of morbidity, is a spectrum of chronic lung diseases including&#xD;
      clinical diagnoses of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and combinations of both. Varying&#xD;
      degrees of bronchoreactivity occur over the entire spectrum. Asthma and COPD have many&#xD;
      features in common. Distinction is usually dependent on clinical features and clinical&#xD;
      course. The diagnosis of asthma will not exclude a patient from the designation of COPD for&#xD;
      this study, although criteria for exclusion include recent (within six months) use of inhaled&#xD;
      or oral steroid with the intent of excluding most of those who are clearly predominantly&#xD;
      bronchospastic. The morbid anatomy of COPD is well described and includes many features of&#xD;
      acute and chronic inflammation. There is well supported evidence in the literature that this&#xD;
      inflammatory process may be an important pathogenetic mechanism in the development of&#xD;
      emphysema. On this basis, the rationale for the use of corticosteroids is well justified.&#xD;
      There are various published studies suggesting that inhaled steroids reduce bronchial lavage&#xD;
      markers of inflammation, variously influence short-term bronchial hyperreactivity, improve&#xD;
      lung function acutely or short-term, and slow rate of decline in lung function. Most studies&#xD;
      have asked for improvement rather than stability. However, despite the studies which do not&#xD;
      support these contentions and the lack of long-term information, inhaled steroids in COPD are&#xD;
      becoming widely used in clinical practice. It was the intent of this clinical trial to assess&#xD;
      the long-term efficacy of this treatment before such therapy became an accepted community&#xD;
      practice, making it impractical or impossible to conduct a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were recruited from the Lung Health Study I and randomized to 1200 micrograms of&#xD;
      triamcinolone in daily divided doses or to placebo. Pulmonary function was evaluated every&#xD;
      six months. Bronchial activity was tested at baseline, at nine months, and at&#xD;
      three-and-a-half years using a methacholine inhalation challenge. Mean duration of follow-up&#xD;
      was 40 months. The primary outcome measure was the rate of decline in pulmonary function as&#xD;
      assessed by the post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) value.&#xD;
      Other outcome measures included death, respiratory symptoms, quality of life, side-effects&#xD;
      and toxicity, adherence, bronchial hyperreactivity, atopic status, and smoking status.&#xD;
      Recruitment was initiated in November 1994 and ended November 28, 1995 to allow 3.5 to 4.5&#xD;
      years of follow-up through April, 1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators initiated a dose monitor (puff counter) protocol at nine of the centers&#xD;
      among the fair to satisfactory compliers (4 to 9 puffs versus the ideal of 12 puffs per day)&#xD;
      to test whether a memory aid would enhance inhaler compliance. Consenting participants were&#xD;
      randomized to Group 1 who could see the display on the puff counter for 12 months or to Group&#xD;
      2 who had no counter for three months, a counter that recorded but did not display for three&#xD;
      months, and a counter with display for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were a bone densitometry and adrenal suppression ancillary studies, funded by&#xD;
      Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer, to assess the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on bone density and&#xD;
      adrenal function.&#xD;
