      The Community Outreach Intervention Project (COIP) implemented and evaluated a TB&#xD;
      intervention with injection drug users (IDUs) in two Chicago Neighborhoods, guided by the&#xD;
      indigenous outreach leadership model that had been used for AIDS prevention among drug users.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis was on the decline from the mid 1950s until the mid 1980s; however, the United&#xD;
      States is now experiencing a resurgence of tuberculosis. In 1992, approximately 27,000 new&#xD;
      cases were reported, an increase of about 20 percent from 1985 to 1992. Not only are&#xD;
      tuberculosis cases on the increase, but a serious aspect of the problem is the recent&#xD;
      occurence of outbreaks of multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, which poses an urgent&#xD;
      public health problem and requires rapid intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control programs involve two major components. First, and of highest priority, is to detect&#xD;
      persons with active tuberculosis and treat them with effective antituberculosis drugs, which&#xD;
      prevents death from tuberculosis and stops the transmission of infection to other persons.&#xD;
      Treatment of active tuberculosis involves taking multiple antituberculosis drugs daily or&#xD;
      several times weekly for at least six months. Failure to take the medications for the full&#xD;
      treatment period may mean that the disease is not cured and may recur. If sufficient&#xD;
      medications are not prescribed early and taken regularly, the tuberculosis organism can&#xD;
      become resistant to the drugs, and the drug resistant tubercuosis then may be transmitted to&#xD;
      other persons. Drug resistant disease is difficult and expensive to treat, and in some cases,&#xD;
      cannot be treated with available medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second major goal of control efforts is the detection and treatment of persons who do not&#xD;
      have active tuberculosis, but who have latent tuberculosis infection. These people may be at&#xD;
      high risk of developing active tuberculosis. The only approved treatment modality for&#xD;
      preventive therapy requires treatment daily or twice weekly for a minimum of six months, and&#xD;
      many patients do not complete the full course of therapy. Public and patient programs are&#xD;
      needed to increase the awareness of the problems associated with tuberculosis control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is part of the NHLBI initiative &quot;Behavioral Interventions for Control of&#xD;
      Tuberculosis&quot; . The concept for the initiative originated from the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Working Group on Health and Behavior. The Request for Applications was released in&#xD;
      October, 1994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hypotheses were tested. The first was that rates of treatment adherence would be&#xD;
      greater among actively infected injection drug users assisted through indigenous outreach&#xD;
      than through conventional TB control methods practiced by the Chicago Department of Health.&#xD;
      The second hypothesis was that rates of compliance with contact tracing, screening and&#xD;
      treatment wouldl be greater through the COIP intervention than through the practices of the&#xD;
      Health Department. The third was that community level rates of TB would decrease over the&#xD;
      years of the study as a result of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of the cases and contacts for Phase II began in July 1996. The intervention was&#xD;
      implemented by a specially trained indigenous outreach staff guided by an experienced&#xD;
      ethnographer. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to assess the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on treatment completion, attendance, compliance with contact and screening&#xD;
      efforts, knowledge of TB transmission, reduction of health risk behavior and rates of TB&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
