  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of HIV-1 gp120 C4-V3 hybrid polyvalent peptide immunogen (C4-V3&#xD;
      peptides) formulated in mineral oil containing mannose mono-oleate (IFA) in HIV-1 uninfected&#xD;
      volunteers. To evaluate the humoral and cellular immune responses to the C4-V3 peptides as&#xD;
      measured by the induction of 1 or more of the following: neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 MN&#xD;
      and RF, cross-neutralizing antibodies to primary isolates of HIV-1, HIV-1 antigen-specific&#xD;
      lymphoproliferation, CD8+ and CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity specific for HIV-1&#xD;
      gp120 or V3 peptides corresponding to the vaccine strains of HIV-1, induction of HLA-B7 and&#xD;
      HLA-A2 restricted CD8+CTLs, and induction of HIV-specific DTH responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) is constructed from 4 sequences of the HIV-1 V3 gp120&#xD;
      loop shared by approximately 80% of North American HIV-1 strains. Because of the critical&#xD;
      role that this region plays in generating anti-HIV sequences, it is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) will be capable of inducing a broad range of cross-reactive&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies in the majority of recipients.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Twenty-eight volunteers are randomized to receive two 0.5 ml injections of C4-43 peptides in&#xD;
      IFA or placebo (IFA alone) administered intramuscularly at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months. At least&#xD;
      50% of all volunteers (6 per Groups I and II; 2, Group III) must be HLA-B7 phenotype.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative ELISA for HIV within 8 weeks of immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal chest x-ray within 4 weeks prior to initial immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Low-risk sexual behavior as defined by AVEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers with the following conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical or psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol,&#xD;
             including recent suicidal ideation or present psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Occupational responsibilities which preclude compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active syphilis (if the serology is documented to be a false positive or due to a&#xD;
             remote [more than 6 months] treated infection, the volunteer is eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active tuberculosis (volunteers with a positive purified protein derivative and a&#xD;
             normal chest x-ray showing no evidence of TB and not requiring isoniazid therapy are&#xD;
             eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers with the following prior conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;

             Individuals with a history of cancer are excluded unless there has been surgical&#xD;
             excision followed by a sufficient observation period to give a reasonable assurance of&#xD;
             cure.&#xD;
