      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given together&#xD;
      with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium in treating patients with solid tumors that are&#xD;
      metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib&#xD;
      together with chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PS-341&#xD;
      (bortezomib) when administered as a bolus injection two times a week (on days 1 and 4) for 2&#xD;
      weeks followed by one week of rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of PS-341 by determining the 20S proteasome and nuclear&#xD;
      factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) inhibition in blood of patients&#xD;
      treated with intravenous PS-341 combined with weekly fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin&#xD;
      calcium (LV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify any objective tumor response in patients treated with intravenous PS-341.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the relationship between inhibition of the 20S proteasome and NFkB and&#xD;
      clinical toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To obtain preliminary data on molecular correlates of response to PS-341 and 5-FU and LV&#xD;
      including genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation and&#xD;
      adhesion/angiogenesis based on the mechanisms of PS-341 IV. To examine the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of 5-FU when co-administered with PS-341.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 4 and fluorouracil IV and&#xD;
      leucovorin calcium IV on day 1 weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to entering the study and 6 weeks from nitrosourea-containing chemotherapy; all&#xD;

             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
