      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing&#xD;
      so they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of suramin in treating patients who have&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma or Castleman's disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tumor response of patients with refractory or relapsed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma or Castleman's disease treated with suramin. II. Determine the effects of this&#xD;
      regimen on cytokine-mediated symptoms in patients with Castleman's disease. III. Determine&#xD;
      the overall and progression-free survival in patients with multiple myeloma or Castelman's&#xD;
      disease treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the qualitative, quantitative, and&#xD;
      cumulative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the effect of this&#xD;
      regimen on the levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor, and soluble gp130&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive suramin on days 1-5, 8, 11, 15, 19, 22, and 29. During course 1,&#xD;
      patients also receive suramin on days 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78. Suramin is administered&#xD;
      IV over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 and over 1 hour on all subsequent infusion days.&#xD;
      Patients undergo rest for at least 12 weeks between each course. Patients with responding&#xD;
      disease after completion of course 2 may receive additional courses in the absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, every 2 weeks for 1 month,&#xD;
      at 3 months, and then monthly thereafter if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients with multiple myeloma will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 10-20 months. A total of 20-40 patients with Castleman's disease will be accrued&#xD;
      for this study within 2.9-8 years.&#xD;
