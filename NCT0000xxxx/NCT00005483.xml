  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the distribution of homocysteine and prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia with&#xD;
      emphasis on race, sex and age. To determine the extent to which hyperhomocysteinemia is&#xD;
      associated with status of folate and vitamin B12. Finally, to describe the relationships&#xD;
      between prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia and prevalence of cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      assess the importance of this risk factor as a cause of vascular disease among US adults. The&#xD;
      study was renewed for one year to investigate normal homocysteine concentrations among&#xD;
      children and to identify nutritional and non-nutritional determinants of total homocysteine&#xD;
      concentrations in children.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition of elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations resulting&#xD;
      from impaired sulfur amino acid metabolism, may be a powerful risk factor for occlusive&#xD;
      vascular disease. However, little is known about the distribution of hyperhomocysteinemia in&#xD;
      the general population. Furthermore, inadequate nutritional status might be a strong&#xD;
      determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia, but its importance at a population level (as measured by&#xD;
      the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia associated with inadequate nutrition) has received&#xD;
      little study. Finally, levels of homocysteine associated with elevated risk of vascular&#xD;
      disease have not been clearly established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using previously collected plasma samples, studies were conducted on the distribution of&#xD;
      homocysteine and prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia with emphasis on race, sex and age.&#xD;
      Investigations were undertaken on the extent of the relationship of hyperhomocysteinemia to&#xD;
      folate and vitamin B12. Finally, the relationships were described between prevalence of&#xD;
      hyperhomocysteinemia and prevalence of cardiovascular disease and the importance of this risk&#xD;
      factor as a cause of vascular disease among US adults was assessed..&#xD;
