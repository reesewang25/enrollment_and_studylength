    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IIb/III trial is studying celecoxib to see how well it works in&#xD;
      preventing disease recurrence in patients who have bladder cancer. Chemoprevention therapy is&#xD;
      the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use&#xD;
      of celecoxib may be an effective way to prevent the recurrence of bladder cancer&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the time to recurrence after treatment with celecoxib vs placebo in patients with&#xD;
      superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder at high risk for recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate the modulation of one or more biomarkers with recurrence of bladder cancer and&#xD;
      confirm the value of the marker(s) as a surrogate endpoint biomarker for bladder cancer and&#xD;
      celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the toxicity of celecoxib in these patients. IV. Compare the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients&#xD;
      are stratified according to center and presence of Tis disease (yes vs no). Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to one of two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment continues in both arms for 1-2 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      development of recurrent or invasive bladder carcinoma, or development of a second malignancy&#xD;
      requiring radiotherapy or systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at week 54.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 6 weeks and then every 12 weeks until the last randomized patient&#xD;
      has been on the study for 1 year or until disease recurrence.&#xD;
