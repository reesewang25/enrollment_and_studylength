      Bacteria carry substances on their surface called antigens. When antigens come into contact&#xD;
      with the right kinds of cells in the body an immune reaction is caused. This reaction is&#xD;
      often the symptoms of sickness that a patient feels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for the body to fight off the attack of antigens, it creates substances called&#xD;
      antibodies. Antibodies counter the action of antigens and make the bacteria harmless.&#xD;
      However, the immune system must learn how to make the right antibodies for the right&#xD;
      antigens. Sometimes the body creates antibodies that confuse normal tissues as foreign and&#xD;
      attack them. This is called an autoimmune reaction and sometimes occurs when the body is&#xD;
      exposed to certain bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One bacteria known for causing autoimmune reactions is Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus&#xD;
      (GABHS). This bacteria often causes throat infections commonly known as &quot;strep throat&quot;. Some&#xD;
      researchers believe that the autoimmune reaction associated with strep throat infections may&#xD;
      cause neuropsychiatric disorders, like obsessive-compulsive disorder and/or tic disorder in&#xD;
      children. As a result, each time a child with one of these disorders experiences an infection&#xD;
      with GABHS his/her symptoms can reoccur or worsen. Researchers believe that by giving&#xD;
      patients a certain antibiotic, they can prevent GABHS infection and thus prevent the return&#xD;
      of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test the effectiveness of the antibiotic Amoxicillin for the&#xD;
      treatment of Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal&#xD;
      infections (PANDAS). Patients will receive Amoxicillin for six weeks and placebos &quot;inactive&#xD;
      sugar pills&quot; for six weeks in order to see if the medication is truly working. Effectiveness&#xD;
      of the treatment will be based on the presence or absence of symptoms. If at the end of the&#xD;
      study Amoxicillin is proven to be effective treatment for PANDAS patients may be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to continue taking the medication for an additional six months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An increasing body of evidence suggests that Group A beta-Hemolytic Streptococcal throat&#xD;
      infections (GABHS) may trigger the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tic&#xD;
      disorder in certain vulnerable children via an autoimmune process. In this subgroup of&#xD;
      children with childhood-onset OCD and tic disorders, preliminary data suggest some children&#xD;
      have a rapid response to amoxicillin. After only 24 to 48 hours of treatment, they have a&#xD;
      dramatic reduction in OC symptoms and tics. To date, we have observed this phenomenon in at&#xD;
      least 5 children, each of whom relapsed when the amoxicillin was stopped. These observations&#xD;
      raise a number of questions, including whether or not amoxicillin has a direct central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) effect or an indirect effect through perturbations of the immune system&#xD;
      (e.g., cytokine shifts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if amoxicillin is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      PANDAS, as well as examining possible mechanisms of this effect. We propose to do this with a&#xD;
      3-month double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of amoxicillin treatment with a&#xD;
      randomized A-B-A-B design. Outcome measures will be blinded ratings of tic severity,&#xD;
      standardized measures of psychopathology, and immunologic assays (such as type I and type II&#xD;
      cytokine levels).&#xD;

        Subjects with presence of OCD and/or tic disorder: Must meet lifetime diagnostic criteria&#xD;
        (DSM III or DSM IV) for obsessive compulsive disorder or a tic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pediatric onset: Symptoms of the disorder first become evident between 3 years of age and&#xD;
        the beginning of puberty, as is generally true for rheumatic fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Episodic course of symptom severity: Clinical course is characterized by the abrupt onset&#xD;
        of symptoms or by dramatic symptom exacerbations. Episodic course is characterized by&#xD;
        waxing and waning or symptom severity with greater than +20 percent fluctuation from&#xD;
        baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Association with GABHS infection: Symptom onset or exacerbations must be temporally related&#xD;
        to group A B-Hemolytic Streptococcal infections (GABHS), i.e., associated with positive&#xD;
        throat culture and/or elevated anti-GABHS antibody titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Association with neurological abnormalities: During symptom exacerbations, patients will&#xD;
        have an abnormal neurological examination, such as motoric hyperactivity and adventitious&#xD;
        movements (i.e., choreiform movements or tics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must report history of improvement in their tics and/or OCD when treated with&#xD;
        amoxicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subjects who meet criteria for Autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subjects who have neurologic disorders other than tics/TS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subjects who have and IQ less than 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subjects who have a serious concurrent or chronic medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subjects who have a history of penicillin or amoxicillin allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subjects with history of noncompliance with medical procedures.&#xD;
