      To detect by Doppler echocardiography the incidence of cardiac abnormalities in HIV-positive&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular abnormalities have been reported in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)&#xD;
      clinically, echocardiographically and at autopsy. Pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade,&#xD;
      echocardiographic abnormalities and clinical cardiomyopathy with right and left-sided&#xD;
      congestive heart failure have all been reported as isolated case reports or in small&#xD;
      retrospective series of patients with AIDS who had echocardiograms. The frequency with which&#xD;
      abnormalities specifically related to AIDS were found in consecutively studied patients was&#xD;
      not known in 1988 when the study began.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of these abnormalities was also unclear. Since HIV infection resulted in&#xD;
      profound suppression of T-cell macrophage-mediated immunity in AIDS and since there were&#xD;
      significant abnormalities in B-cell lymphocyte function resulting in abnormalities of humoral&#xD;
      immunity, there were frequently life threatening superinfections by bacterial, fungal,&#xD;
      parasitic, and viral organisms. Some of these, such as herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus,&#xD;
      cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis and histoplasmosis, were known to cause pericarditis and&#xD;
      myocarditis in the absence of AIDS so the presence of definite myocardial disease in AIDS did&#xD;
      not prove that the disease was due to the HIV organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using echocardiography to study cardiac structure and function in a small series of patients&#xD;
      with AIDS, abnormalities have been identified in from 25 to 75 percent of patients. All of&#xD;
      these studies were retrospective; none was prospective with controls. Furthermore, all types&#xD;
      of echocardiographic abnormalities have been described including the presence of pericardial&#xD;
      fluid, mitral valve prolapse, chamber size abnormalities, and wall motion abnormalities.&#xD;
      Although these abnormalities could have been due to infection with the HIV organism there&#xD;
      were many other possible reasons for the echocardiographic abnormalities. Among AIDS patients&#xD;
      there was a high incidence of intravenous drug and alcohol abuse, patients in whom cardiac&#xD;
      abnormalities were common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there were no echocardiographic studies comparing HIV antibody- positive groups of&#xD;
      patients to appropriate controls, it was not known whether the high reported incidence of&#xD;
      echocardiographic abnormalities was related specifically to the HIV infection, to&#xD;
      superinfection with other organisms, or was related to factors other than AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project was part of an Institute-initiated study on AIDS-Associated Heart Disease in&#xD;
      Adults. In September 1987 the concept was approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Advisory Council and a Request for Applications was released. Awards were made in July 1988.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recruited from the in-patient out-patient clinics and wards of the San&#xD;
      Francisco General Hospital and the Moffitt-Long Hospitals. A medical history was obtained and&#xD;
      a physical examination conducted which included an electrocardiogram, chest x-rays and&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiogram. All studies were repeated every four months for four years in&#xD;
      HIV-positive groups. If clinical evidence of cardiac disease appeared, all studies including&#xD;
      chest x-ray were repeated at that time. If there was normal systolic function in patients&#xD;
      with definite left ventricular failure, a radionuclide angiogram was obtained to further&#xD;
      evaluate left ventricular diastolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
