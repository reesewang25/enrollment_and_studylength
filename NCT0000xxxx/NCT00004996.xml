    <textblock>
      This study will compare the structure, chemical composition and other characteristics of skin&#xD;
      and blood in people with and without parasitic infections. Cell samples will be taken from&#xD;
      blisters produced by suction blistering. This study may provide new information about the&#xD;
      interactions between parasites and the immune system that could lead to better treatments for&#xD;
      these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and patients with acute helminth (a type of parasite) infections aged 18&#xD;
      years older may be eligible for this study. Following a medical history and physical exam,&#xD;
      participants will undergo suction blistering to provide cells needed for study. A suction&#xD;
      blister device is attached to the skin of the thigh. A heating element in the device heats&#xD;
      the skin to speed blister formation. (This will feel only a slightly warm.) The device is&#xD;
      removed after about two hours, when the blisters have formed. The blister tops are removed&#xD;
      with sterile scissors. The blistered areas are then treated with special dressings to promote&#xD;
      healing and the participant is discharged with further wound care instructions. A small&#xD;
      amount of blood (around four tablespoons) may be drawn to compare chemicals in the blood with&#xD;
      chemicals in the blister fluid. Participants will be contacted by telephone over the next 72&#xD;
      hours to check on healing. Further follow-up will occur by phone at 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 blisters may be produced over a one-year period (in three separate sessions every&#xD;
      six months) with no more than 20 raised per session....&#xD;
