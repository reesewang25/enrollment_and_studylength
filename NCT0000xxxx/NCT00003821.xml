      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminopterin in treating patients who&#xD;
      have refractory or recurrent endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the antitumor activity of aminopterin in patients with persistent,&#xD;
      recurrent, or refractory endometrial carcinoma who have failed prior first line cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of aminopterin in&#xD;
      this patient population. III. Determine the overall patient survival and time to progression&#xD;
      of these patients. IV. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral aminopterin every 12 hours twice weekly. Treatment continues&#xD;
      for up to 15 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      are followed every 3 months until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
