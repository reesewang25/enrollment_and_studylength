  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation of patients with brain and spinal cord tumors. Its purpose is&#xD;
      threefold: 1) to allow physicians in NIH s Neuro-Oncology Branch to increase their knowledge&#xD;
      of the course of central nervous system tumors and identify areas that need further research;&#xD;
      2) to inform participants of new studies at the National Cancer Institute and other centers&#xD;
      as they are developed; and 3) to provide patients consultation on possible treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children (at least 1 year old) and adults with primary malignant brain and spinal cord tumors&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a medical history, physical and&#xD;
      neurological examinations and routine blood tests. They may also undergo one or more of the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic&#xD;
           field and radio waves instead of X-rays to show detailed changes in brain structure and&#xD;
           chemistry. For the procedure, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder&#xD;
           containing a magnetic field. A contrast material called gadolinium may be used (injected&#xD;
           into a vein) to enhance the images. The procedure takes about an hour, and the patient&#xD;
           can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed axial tomography (CAT or CT) CT is a specialized form of X-ray imaging that&#xD;
           produces 3-dimensional images of the brain in sections. The scanner is a ring device&#xD;
           that surrounds the patient and contains a moveable X-ray source. The scan takes about 30&#xD;
           minutes and may be done with or without the use of a contrast dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) PET is a diagnostic test that is based on differences&#xD;
           in how cells take up and use glucose (sugar), one of the body s main fuels. The patient&#xD;
           is given an injection of radioactive glucose. A special camera surrounding the patient&#xD;
           detects the radiation emitted by the radioactive material and produces images that show&#xD;
           how much glucose is being used by various tissues. Fast-growing cells, such as tumors,&#xD;
           take up and use more glucose than normal cells do, and therefore, the scan might&#xD;
           indicate the overall activity or aggressiveness of the tumor. The procedure takes about&#xD;
           an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all the tests are completed, the physician will discuss the results and potential&#xD;
      treatment options with the patient. Follow-up will vary according to the individual. Some&#xD;
      patients may end the study with just one visit to NIH, while others may be followed at NIH&#xD;
      regularly, in conjunction with their local physicians. Patients with aggressive tumors may be&#xD;
      seen every 3 or 4 months, while those with less active tumors may be seen every 6 to 12&#xD;
      months. Permission may be requested for telephone follow-up (with the patient or physician)&#xD;
      of patients not seen regularly at NIH.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to evaluate patients with tumors of the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) who appear to be probable candidates for future protocol entry or have disease&#xD;
      manifestations that are of unique scientific interest, importance, and/or educational value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate patients with tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) who are probable future&#xD;
      candidates for NCI Phase I and II protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow patients with tumors of the CNS that are representative of important scientific&#xD;
      and/or clinical principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow a steady flow of patients with tumors of the CNS at the NIH for the purpose of&#xD;
      educating nurses, medical students, residents, clinical fellows, and physicians in the&#xD;
      management and care of this specialized subgroup of cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients greater than 12 months of age with tumors of the CNS of interest to the NOB, who&#xD;
      may be candidates for another NOB trial at some point in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tumors of the CNS that are of particular interest to members of the NOB because&#xD;
      they pose important clinical and/or scientific questions and/or shed light on important&#xD;
      aspects of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tumors of the CNS who offer an important educational benefit to neuro-oncology&#xD;
      trainees and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the&#xD;
      willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Availability of a parent or legal&#xD;
      guardian to give informed consent for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo an initial evaluation at the Clinical Center by a member of the NOB&#xD;
      where past medical and oncologic histories will be obtained as well as relevant data such as&#xD;
      neuroimaging and pathology review. A total of 3,000 patients will be accrued to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be seen at the NIH Clinical Center at varying intervals depending on the&#xD;
      clinical situation but data related to the natural history of their disease course and&#xD;
      outcome will be collected at least every six months.&#xD;
