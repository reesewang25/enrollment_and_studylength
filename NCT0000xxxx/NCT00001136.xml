  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give an HIV vaccine (vCP205) to&#xD;
      volunteers who received an HIV vaccine at least 2 years ago, and to study how the immune&#xD;
      system responds to this vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines are given to people to try to resist infection or prevent disease. There are a&#xD;
      number of different HIV vaccines that are currently being tested. The vaccines that seem to&#xD;
      be the most promising are canarypox vaccines, known as ALVAC vaccines; the vaccine tested in&#xD;
      this study is ALVAC-HIV vCP205. This study will look at the safety of the vaccine and how the&#xD;
      immune system responds to it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines may provide a route of therapy against HIV-1 infections by boosting the immune&#xD;
      system responses. An artificially constructed HIV-1 vaccine (NYCBH), using vaccinia virus as&#xD;
      its vector, has the advantage of conferring both cellular and humoral immune responses that&#xD;
      are long-lived. Studies have shown that a second artificially constructed vector vaccine,&#xD;
      HIV-1 canarypox (vCP205), also increases CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, a&#xD;
      cell-mediated immune response. Yet, immune responses are not boosted in volunteers previously&#xD;
      vaccinated with vaccinia-based HIV-1 vaccines when a second vaccination with the same vaccine&#xD;
      is given. One theory for vaccinia vaccine's failure is that immunologic barriers by&#xD;
      antibodies to the vector itself may be responsible. This study examines the effectiveness of&#xD;
      boosting the immune responses following vCP205 vaccination in the following: 1) volunteers&#xD;
      who were previously immunized with vCP205 vaccine who may or may not have shown increased&#xD;
      immune responses following the first immunization, and 2) volunteers who were previously&#xD;
      immunized with NYCBH vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon study entry volunteers receive one injection of ALVAC-HIV vCP205. Temperature and&#xD;
      symptoms should be recorded by the volunteer each day for 2 days and reported to the clinic&#xD;
      staff. Volunteers will have seven clinic visits for drawing blood, collecting urine&#xD;
      specimens, and performing clinical evaluations. At Month 3 HIV testing will be done.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be followed for 3 months, with a passive follow-up call at the end of a year&#xD;
      and once or twice a year for the next 5 years. Counseling on avoidance of HIV infection and&#xD;
      pregnancy will be done.&#xD;
