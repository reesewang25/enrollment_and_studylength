  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy with aerosolized pentamidine (PEN)&#xD;
      with that of conventional therapy, sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in the&#xD;
      treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients who have AIDS, are HIV&#xD;
      positive, or are at high risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New treatments are needed for PCP, a common lung infection in patients with AIDS, because&#xD;
      many patients treated with the two standard treatments, PEN given by injections and SMX/TMP,&#xD;
      have had adverse effects that required a change in treatment. There is also a high relapse&#xD;
      rate after the standard treatments. Preliminary experiments in humans suggest that&#xD;
      aerosolized PEN is as effective as the standard treatments for PCP, and causes few adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      New treatments are needed for PCP, a common lung infection in patients with AIDS, because&#xD;
      many patients treated with the two standard treatments, PEN given by injections and SMX/TMP,&#xD;
      have had adverse effects that required a change in treatment. There is also a high relapse&#xD;
      rate after the standard treatments. Preliminary experiments in humans suggest that&#xD;
      aerosolized PEN is as effective as the standard treatments for PCP, and causes few adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients entered in the study are randomly assigned to aerosolized PEN or to intravenous&#xD;
      SMX/TMP, for a 21-day trial. SMX/TMP is given 4 times a day and aerosolized PEN once a day.&#xD;
      Doses are determined by body size. Patients who receive aerosolized PEN also receive a&#xD;
      placebo intravenous injection and patients who receive SMX/TMP also receive a placebo&#xD;
      aerosol. Patients are hospitalized at least 5 days. Patients who improve may be discharged&#xD;
      after 5 days at the discretion of the attending physician. Discharged patients continue the&#xD;
      study with oral SMX/TMP and aerosolized placebo or aerosolized PEN and oral placebo. Patients&#xD;
      who fail to respond or who develop severe adverse effects are switched to intravenous PEN or&#xD;
      other standard therapy. During the 21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used. AZT may be&#xD;
      resumed after therapy for the acute PCP episode is completed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zidovudine (AZT), but must be suspended during study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unequivocal diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia established by morphologic&#xD;
        confirmation of three or more typical Pneumocystis carinii organisms in sputum,&#xD;
        bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or lung tissue obtained by transbronchial or open-lung biopsy&#xD;
        within 3 days before or after randomization. If morphologic confirmation is not possible&#xD;
        prior to therapy, patients may be randomized if the investigator believes there is a high&#xD;
        suspicion of PCP based on clinical presentation. If morphologic diagnosis cannot be&#xD;
        established within 5 days of randomization, the patient will be withdrawn from study&#xD;
        therapy. Resting (A-a) DO2 less than 30 torr on room air at all ACTG sites except San&#xD;
        Francisco General Hospital. Non-ACTG sites will enter patients up to a resting (A-a)&#xD;
        DO2less than 55 mmHg on room air.&#xD;
