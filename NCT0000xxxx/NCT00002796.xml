  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop&#xD;
      growing or die. Interferon-gamma may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the&#xD;
      growth of the tumor. Combining more than one drug with interferon-gamma may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells. This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving&#xD;
      fluorouracil together with phenylbutyrate, indomethacin, and interferon-gamma and to see how&#xD;
      well it works in treating patients with stage IV colorectal cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine in a Phase I study the toxicity of flurouracil (FU) when given in escalating&#xD;
      doses in combination with fixed doses of phenlylbutyrate (PB), indomethacin and recombinant&#xD;
      human interferon-gamma (rhIFNg) to patients with advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine in a Phase II study the efficacy of FU in combination with PB, indomethacin&#xD;
      and rhIFNg in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil (5-FU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Patients receive 5-FU IV over 24 hours on day 1; phenylbutyrate IV over 120 hours&#xD;
      and oral indomethacin daily on days 2-6; and interferon gamma subcutaneously on days 2, 4,&#xD;
      and 6. Courses repeat weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which less than 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II :Patients receive 5-FU, phenylbutyrate, indomethacin, and interferon gamma as in&#xD;
      phase I at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this&#xD;
      study and approximately 46 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.&#xD;
