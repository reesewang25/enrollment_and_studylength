      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing&#xD;
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer&#xD;
      cells. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor&#xD;
      to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and&#xD;
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      Hodgkin's disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and response to high dose chemotherapy and peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell support in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease. II.&#xD;
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose of etoposide when combined with carboplatin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of etoposide. Patients undergo total nodal&#xD;
      radiotherapy twice a day on days -35 to -31, -28 to -24, and then radiotherapy boost once a&#xD;
      day on days -21 to -17. Patients then receive etoposide IV continuously and carboplatin IV&#xD;
      continuously on days -6 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.&#xD;
      Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients who have received prior&#xD;
      extensive radiation (at least 2000 cGy to any site) only receive chemotherapy and peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell infusion. Cohorts of 4-8 patients receive escalating doses of etoposide until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 1 of&#xD;
      4 or 2 of 8 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 1-3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, then every 3 months until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 4 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
