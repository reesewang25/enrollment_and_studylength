  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF&#xD;
      flows through channels in the brain and around the spinal cord. Occasionally, people are born&#xD;
      with malformations of these channels. Syringomyelia is a pocket within the CSF channels that&#xD;
      results from abnormal CSF flow. Syringomyelia is associated with problems in the nervous&#xD;
      system. Patients with syringomyelia may be unable to detect sensations of pain and heat. If&#xD;
      the condition is not treated it can worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of this condition is surgical. It requires that the flow of CSF is returns to&#xD;
      normal. There are many different treatment options, but no one procedure has been shown to be&#xD;
      significantly better than any other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers would like to learn more about how the CSF pressure and flow&#xD;
      contribute to the progression of syringomyelia. Ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) will be used to evaluate the anatomy of the brain. Researchers hope that information&#xD;
      gathered about anatomy and measures of CSF pressure and flow can be used later to develop an&#xD;
      optimal surgical treatment for syringomyelia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the mechanism of development and progression of&#xD;
      syringomyelia. Although syringomyelia usually accompanies anatomic abnormalities at the&#xD;
      craniocervical junction, the pathophysiology that relates these anatomic abnormalities to&#xD;
      syringomyelia development and progression is controversial. We have been testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that progression of syringomyelia associated with the Chiari I malformation is&#xD;
      produced by the cerebellar tonsils partially occluding the subarachnoid space at the foramen&#xD;
      magnum and acting as a piston on the partially enclosed spinal subarachnoid space, creating&#xD;
      enlarged cervical subarachnoid pressure waves which compress the spinal cord from without,&#xD;
      not from within, and propagate syrinx fluid caudally with each heartbeat, which leads to&#xD;
      syrinx progression. We are also testing the hypothesis that development of syringomyelia&#xD;
      results from increased transit of CSF through the spinal cord parenchyma and into the syrinx.&#xD;
      Patients are treated with posterior fossa craniectomy, upper cervical laminectomy, and&#xD;
      duroplasty. We evaluate cerebrospinal fluid flow and pressure, syrinx size, neurologic&#xD;
      function, and the rate of entrance of CSF into the syrinx before and after surgery. These&#xD;
      studies and the intraoperative evaluation of the movement of the cerebellar tonsils and the&#xD;
      walls of the syrinx are providing data which elucidate the hydrodynamic mechanism of&#xD;
      development and progression of syringomyelia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best treatment for this type of syringomyelia has not been established. Present surgical&#xD;
      treatment results in disease stabilization in many, but not all patients, although objective&#xD;
      improvement is less common. Delayed deterioration is not uncommon. Correlation of the&#xD;
      anatomic and physiologic measurements should provide data which indicate the mode of&#xD;
      development and progression of syringomyelia and which may have implications for the optimal&#xD;
      treatment of syringomyelia.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible to participate in this research study, the subject must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have syringomyelia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a lesion that narrows the space for spinal fluid at the base of the skull or neck.&#xD;
        Prior surgery for syringomyelia does not result in exclusion from the study if there is&#xD;
        radiographic evidence of a syrinx and there is evidence of neurological deterioration&#xD;
        related to the syrinx.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject will not be eligible to participate in this research study if the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Is pregnant (because X-rays might injure a fetus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cannot have an MRI scan as determined by the radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Has a problem with bleeding that cannot be corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Is unable to understand the risks of the testing and surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Has a blood test for HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) that is positive, because a positive&#xD;
        HIV test would increase the risk of infection from research testing.&#xD;
