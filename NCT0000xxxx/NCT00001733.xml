  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This screening protocol is designed to help recruit patients for National Eye Institute (NEI)&#xD;
      studies of the retina, such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Patients must&#xD;
      meet the specific criteria of a research study, and this protocol serves as a first step for&#xD;
      admitting patients to a retinal disease study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will undergo a medical history and comprehensive eye examination. The eye&#xD;
      examination includes dilation of the pupils to fully examine the retina. In some studies,&#xD;
      photographs of the eye are required. This is done using fluorescein angiography. In this&#xD;
      procedure, a dye called sodium fluorescein is injected into the blood stream through a vein.&#xD;
      After the dye reaches the blood vessels of the eye, photographs are taken of the retina.&#xD;
      Other diagnostic procedures may include physical examination, questionnaires, routine&#xD;
      laboratory tests and other standard or specialized tests, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the screening is completed, patients will be informed of their options to participate in&#xD;
      a study. Patients who are ineligible for a current study will be informed of alternative&#xD;
      treatments or options. No treatment is offered under this protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed for the screening of patients with presumed retinovascular&#xD;
      diseases. It serves as a first step for individuals who may be eligible and wish to&#xD;
      participate in National Eye Institute clinical research studies of retinovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual will be thoroughly evaluated during the screening process to determine if&#xD;
      they are suitable candidates for inclusion in any of the National Eye Institute ongoing&#xD;
      studies. The screening evaluation will include past and current medical histories and an&#xD;
      appropriate physical examination, namely a comprehensive eye exam. Other routine diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures and tests may also be completed in order to help determine a subject's&#xD;
      eligibility. These tests and procedures are of minimal risk and will be described in more&#xD;
      detail in section III: &quot;Study Procedures.&quot; Once the screening process is completed and their&#xD;
      eligibility is assessed, the subjects will be informed of their options to participate in one&#xD;
      or more of the current clinical research studies. If no appropriate protocol is identified,&#xD;
      recommendations for other treatment options may be given to the individual, their primary&#xD;
      doctor, or referring physician.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion and exclusion criteria vary with the particular protocol for which a patient is&#xD;
        being screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to those diagnoses currently under study, subjects with unknown conditions that&#xD;
        require the establishment of a diagnosis may be eligible for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All studies of retinovascular diseases require the subject to have minimum age of 18 years&#xD;
        in both men and women.&#xD;
