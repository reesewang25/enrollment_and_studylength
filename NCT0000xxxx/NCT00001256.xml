      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of prednisone and methotrexate in&#xD;
      treating severe Wegener's granulomatosis and other systemic vasculitides. These diseases&#xD;
      involve inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) that may affect the brain, nerves, eyes,&#xD;
      sinuses, lungs, kidneys, intestinal tract, skin, joints, heart and other sites. Current&#xD;
      treatment with prednisone and the anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide is effective, but has&#xD;
      significant side effects and a high rate of disease recurrence. In a small number of patients&#xD;
      with vasculitis, prednisone and methotrexate, another anti-cancer drug, have led to marked&#xD;
      improvement, with fewer side effects than are seen with cyclophosphamide. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate this drug combination in a larger patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 10 to 80 years of age with active Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa,&#xD;
      Churg-Strauss vasculitis, or microscopic polyangiitis overlap may be eligible for this 2 1/2&#xD;
      to 3-year study. In addition, patients with glomerulonephritis (a type of kidney disease) and&#xD;
      a positive blood test for C-ANCA (antibodies found in certain vasculitic kidney diseases) or&#xD;
      inflammatory sinusitis or lung nodule or infiltrates in the absence of infection may also be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take prednisone daily, by mouth, and low-dose methotrexate weekly, by mouth&#xD;
      or by injection either under the skin, into a muscle or into a vein. Patients who&#xD;
      significantly improve with treatment will gradually reduce, and eventually stop, the&#xD;
      prednisone. If the remission lasts, methotrexate will also be reduced and stopped after 2 1/2&#xD;
      years. If active disease recurs, the original treatment program may be started again.&#xD;
      Patients who never achieve complete remission with treatment but whose symptoms are well&#xD;
      controlled and experience no serious side effects may choose to either continue low-dose&#xD;
      methotrexate or stop therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized 4 to 6 times a year, about 2 to 8 days each time, depending on&#xD;
      their disease severity and response to illness. In addition, they will have the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination (upon admission to the study and then every 1&#xD;
           to 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for blood cell counts and for levels of enzymes that indicate liver damage&#xD;
           (upon admission, then weekly, and finally, no less than monthly).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood tests to measure blood chemistries and evaluate kidney function (upon&#xD;
           admission and again when clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-rays (upon admission and when clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (as needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (upon admission and then as clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function studies (upon admission and at least every 6 months or as clinically&#xD;
           indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ear, nose and throat evaluations (as clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver biopsy, if blood tests to monitor liver function are persistently abnormal. This&#xD;
           procedure is done in the hospital under sedation to induce relaxation and drowsiness.&#xD;
           The skin over the liver (upper right abdomen) is numbed with a local anesthetic and a&#xD;
           needle is passed rapidly in and out of the liver to collect a small tissue sample for&#xD;
           microscopic examination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous studies at the NIH have demonstrated that in over 90% of cases of Wegener's&#xD;
      granulomatosis (WG) and other systemic necrotizing vasculitides, glucocorticoid (GC) and&#xD;
      daily low dose cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy has resulted in marked improvement and even&#xD;
      remission. However, such therapy has been associated with about 50% relapses, 10% resistance&#xD;
      to initial treatment and significant toxicity in almost all patients. Consequently, we have&#xD;
      attempted to identify alternative therapies for the systemic vasculitides that would be less&#xD;
      toxic then daily CP. An NIH study of the efficacy of intermittent high dose intravenous CP&#xD;
      and daily GC (Protocol #88-I-56) revealed that 79% of 14 patients with WG either failed to&#xD;
      respond to treatment, did not sustain improvement or could not tolerate continued treatment&#xD;
      during a period of approximately two years. In another study (Protocol #89-I-18), we&#xD;
      evaluated treatment with GC and weekly oral doses of methotrexate (MTX) in 15 patients with&#xD;
      Takayasu's arteritis, in whom disease previously failed to be controlled with GC, GC + CP, or&#xD;
      in whom remission with such treatment was followed by relapse. Fifty-three percent (8/15) of&#xD;
      patients previously dependent on GC were able to achieve remission and discontinue GC&#xD;
      therapy. Five of seven patients who remained on GC were in remission and receiving at least&#xD;
      50% less GC than prior to MTX therapy. Only three patients had progressive disease. The mean&#xD;
      follow-up period was 20 months. We have also recently analyzed our results for MTX + GC&#xD;
      therapy and 29 patients with WG. Seventy-six percent of patients had marked improvement and&#xD;
      69% achieved remission. Seventy-two percent of those in remission have not required GC&#xD;
      therapy for a mean period 10 months. We conclude that weekly low dose MTX therapy is a&#xD;
      feasible alternative to CP in the treatment of systemic vasculitis. Judgement of the ultimate&#xD;
      value of such therapy should be deferred until a greater number of patients have been studied&#xD;
      over a longer period of time.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis: Wegener's granulomatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: 10-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Qualifications to eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior documentation of vasculitis based on clinical characteristics and histopathological&#xD;
        and/or angiographic evidence of vasculitis. Patients will be eligible for this study&#xD;
        regardless of whether they are currently receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Failure to&#xD;
        respond to prior therapy with other cytotoxic agents or toxicity from such agents, in the&#xD;
        setting of persistent disease, will constitute one reason for eligibility for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the absence of histopathological and/or angiographic evidence of vasculitis, patients&#xD;
        with the following criteria will also be eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Positive C-ANCA (done at the NIH), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Glomerulonephritis as evidenced by the presence of red blood cell casts and proteinuria&#xD;
        or renal biopsy showing necrotizing glomerulonephritis in the absence of positive&#xD;
        immunofluorescence for immunoglobulin and complement, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. One or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inflammatory sinusitis with histopathological evidence of granulomatous inflammation and&#xD;
        negative special stains for mycobacteria and fungi. Sinusitis must be present for at least&#xD;
        3 months and have failed to respond to at least 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy directed&#xD;
        against likely pathogens (H. influenza, S. pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract anaerobic&#xD;
        bacteria);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pulmonary nodule or infiltrates in a patient in the absence of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of active disease as defined by a Vasculitis Disease Activity Index of greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 3 (Appendix I) or if begun on immunosuppressive therapy at an outside&#xD;
        institution, a history of a Vasculitis Disease Activity Index greater than or equal to 3&#xD;
        during the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of infection by gram stain and/or culture specimens. In those instances in which&#xD;
        infection cannot be ruled out by gram stain and culture of secretions or collections of&#xD;
        fluid in involved organs, it may be necessary to obtain a biopsy of the affected tissue for&#xD;
        microbiological and histopathological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recent (within four weeks) increase in GC or cytotoxic drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are pregnant or nursing infants will not be eligible. Fertile women should&#xD;
        have a negative pregnancy test within one week prior to study entry and should be using&#xD;
        effective means of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Processes that would predispose to enhanced risk of MTX toxicity: acute or chronic liver&#xD;
        disease, alcohol abuse (greater than 14 oz of 100 proof liquor or equivalent per week),&#xD;
        active peptic ulcer disease, and inability to comply with study guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serological evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (a serological&#xD;
        determination will be performed within two weeks of study entry).&#xD;
