    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma remains a largely incurable disease with current therapy. Allogeneic bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation provides an opportunity to add the potential antitumor effect of&#xD;
      marrow grafts to those of high dose chemotherapy. One potential strategy for enhancing a&#xD;
      graft vs. tumor effect without aggravating graft vs. host disease would be to selectively&#xD;
      target an immune response against a defined tumor-specific antigen. The idiotype of the&#xD;
      rearranged immunoglobulin gene product of a myeloma can serve as a unique tumor-specific&#xD;
      antigen for vaccine development. We are testing the hypothesis that tumor antigen-specific&#xD;
      immunity can be adoptively transferred to BMT recipients by active immunization of marrow&#xD;
      transplant donors with purified myeloma idiotype protein, conjugated to a carrier protein&#xD;
      (KLH) and administered with GM-CSF as an immunological adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients under age 60 with an HLA-matched sibling donor, with minimal prior treatment,&#xD;
      defined by less than six months prior chemotherapy, and who are in a minimal residual disease&#xD;
      state prior to allogeneic BMT, as defined by the achievement of at least a PR, are eligible.&#xD;
      HLA matched sibling donors receive a series of three vaccinations during an eight week period&#xD;
      prior to bone marrow harvest. Recipients concurrently receive vaccinations pre-BMT, as well&#xD;
      as three booster vaccinations at weeks 12, 16, and 24 post-BMT. Id-KLH (0.5 mg) is&#xD;
      administered s.c. GM-CSF (250 micrograms/m(2)) is administered s.c. locally with the vaccine&#xD;
      on the day of vaccination and for the three consecutive days following vaccination. The&#xD;
      objective of this protocol is to induce cellular and humoral immunity in marrow transplant&#xD;
      donors and recipients against the unique idiotype expressed by the recipient's myeloma.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with IgG or IgA multiple myeloma who attain at least a PR before transplantation&#xD;
        are eligible for thsi protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may only have received 3-4 courses of VAD, high dose cyclophosphamide and one&#xD;
        autologous transplant before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All previous therapy must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should have recovered from all hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity of&#xD;
        previous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Steroid must be discontinued at least two weeks prior to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients less than 60 years are eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Life expectancy greater than 8 weeks and absence of co-existing medical problems which&#xD;
        would significantly increase the risk of the transplant procedure in the judgment of the&#xD;
        bone marrow transplant attending physicians (e.g., the MUGA left ventricular ejection&#xD;
        fraction has to be greater than 50% and DLCO greater thant 50% of the expected value when&#xD;
        corrected for Hb).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Creatinine less than 2x normal and not rising for at least 2-4 weeks before&#xD;
        transplantation. If creatinine is elevated, then creatinine clearance must be greater than&#xD;
        40 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Direct bilirubin less than 2 mg/dl, SGOT less than 4x top normal, and none of these&#xD;
        parameters increasing, for at least 2-4 weeks before transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be HIV-negative, HBsAg-, and Hepatitis C antibody Negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective method&#xD;
        of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        M-protein concentration in the harvested plasma must be greater than 90 percent of the&#xD;
        total Ig of the corresponding isotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Donor criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any consenting healthy individual who fulfills the donor criteria will be considered for&#xD;
        the marrow donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HLA-identical sibling donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HLA, A and B and DR phenotypically identical family donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV, hepatitis B or C seropositive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Complete blood count, platelets, and PT, PTT within normal limits.&#xD;
