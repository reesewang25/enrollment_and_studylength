  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic tool that creates high quality images of the&#xD;
      human body without the use of X-ray (radiation). MRI is especially useful when studying the&#xD;
      brain, because it can provide information about certain brain functions. In addition, MRI is&#xD;
      much better than standard X-rays at showing areas of the brain close to the skull and&#xD;
      detecting changes in the brain associated with neurological diseases. In this study&#xD;
      researchers will use MRI to gather information about the processes that control human&#xD;
      movement and sensory processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate how the brain is activated when remembering,&#xD;
      thinking, or recognizing objects. Researchers would like to determine what happens to brain&#xD;
      functions when patients have trouble remembering, thinking, or recognizing objects following&#xD;
      the start of disorders in the brain and nervous system. In addition, this study will&#xD;
      investigate the processes of motor control in healthy volunteers and patients with disease.&#xD;

      The main purpose of the studies presented in this protocol is to investigate the physiology&#xD;
      of motor control in health as well as the pathophysiological modifications taking place&#xD;
      during disease. Patients and normal volunteers will be scanned at rest and during different&#xD;
      tasks, either while making repetitive movements or undergoing sensory stimulation. These&#xD;
      studies should provide new insight concerning the processes that control human movement and&#xD;
      sensory processing. The studies described in this protocol will be conducted by systems&#xD;
      operating on 1.5 Tesla up to 4 Tesla, including a system at 3 Tesla which is going to be&#xD;
      installed in near future.&#xD;
