      Purpose: This protocol proposes a safety and feasibility trial in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer (stages D1-D3) investigating the induction of antitumor immunity by&#xD;
      administration of cultured autologous peripheral blood precursor derived dendritic cells&#xD;
      (DC), transfected with mRNA amplified from autologous prostate tumor tissue. The feasibility&#xD;
      and dose-limiting toxicity of administering escalating doses of tumor RNA transfected&#xD;
      dendritic cells will be defined. As a secondary endpoint, the ability of tumor RNA&#xD;
      transfected dendritic cells to induce tumor-specific immune responses will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Finally, the anti-tumor effect based on PSA (biochemical) response criteria will be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Because prostate cancer is incurable when metastatic and conventional therapies&#xD;
      do not offer a clear survival benefit, new therapeutic strategies are warranted. This study&#xD;
      is based on the premise that clinically effective cell mediated immune responses against&#xD;
      prostate tumors can be elicited by activation of tumor associated antigen specific T cells.&#xD;
      Work performed by others and our group suggests that PSA, a protein expressed in virtually&#xD;
      all prostate cancers, can serve as a widely expressed candidate antigen for prostate cancer&#xD;
      immunotherapy. In particular, we have shown that cultured dendritic cells transfected with&#xD;
      mRNA encoding PSA are remarkably effective in stimulating antigen specific immunity in vitro.&#xD;
      Therefore, we hypothesize that administration of PSA RNA transfected DC will lead to&#xD;
      detectable levels of PSA specific CTL in the peripheral blood of patients with PSA expressing&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer. It is hoped that these T cell responses also have clinical&#xD;
      antitumor activity.&#xD;

      Methods: Patients will undergo percutaneous needle biopsies from either primary or metastatic&#xD;
      sites to obtain tumor tissue. Patients in whom sufficient tumor mRNA has been amplified by&#xD;
      PCR to transfect the assigned dendritic cell dose will undergo leukapheresis and peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells will be cultured in vitro for 7 days with GM-CSF and IL-4 to generate&#xD;
      precursor derived dendritic cells. Dendritic cells will then be cryopreserved for later use.&#xD;
      On the day the patient returns to receive his infusion (weeks 0, 2, and 4) the dendritic&#xD;
      cells will be thawed, reconstituted, and transfected with amplified total tumor mRNA.&#xD;
      Patients will receive a total of 3 treatments consisting of combined I.V. and I.D.&#xD;
      injections, each on study week 0, 2, and 4. Repeat leukapheresis will be performed 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the last dose to determine immune function. PSA levels will be measured prior to the&#xD;
      start of treatment and 2 weeks following the last infusion. Patients who do not receive&#xD;
      therapy due to a failure to produce sufficient RNA or dendritic cells will be replaced in&#xD;
      order to assess toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: 1. To determine the short and long term toxicities associated with&#xD;
      administration of tumor RNA dendritic cells in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. 2.&#xD;
      To determine feasibility of dendritic cell vaccine generation according to the proportion of&#xD;
      patients for whom sufficient cells are generated to provide treatment. 3. To determine the&#xD;
      cellular immune response to intravenous infusion of tumor RNA dendritic cells. 4. To measure&#xD;
      the PSA response of patients with metastatic prostate cancer to intravenous infusion of tumor&#xD;
      RNA dendritic cells.&#xD;
