      hemophiliac patients who had inhibitors to Factor VIII.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite major advances in the treatment of patients with hemophilia, a serious remaining&#xD;
      challenge was presented by the occurrence of circulating inhibitors to Factor VIII. Because&#xD;
      of lack of information on the natural course of patients with Factor VIII inhibitors, the&#xD;
      relative efficacy of various modes of therapy was not established. The Division of Blood&#xD;
      Diseases and Resources decided to sponsor a clinical investigation which would evaluate&#xD;
      populations of hemophilia patients for Factor VIII inhibitors, follow up these patients to&#xD;
      provide information on the natural history of the inhibitor in the hemophilia patients, and&#xD;
      make available a reference center to monitor results and attain uniformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of a patient with a severe inhibitor and consequent bleeding remained a problem.&#xD;
      Management included protracted treatment with Factor VIII, use of immunosuppressive agents&#xD;
      and prothrombin complex (or Factor IX) concentrates. The rationale for Factor IX was that it&#xD;
      bypassed the defect in Factor VIII caused by the inhibitor. This method of therapy attracted&#xD;
      wide popularity, but the success was greatly debated. It was intended at the very outset of&#xD;
      the Factor VIII study that therapeutic trials involving patients with inhibitors would not be&#xD;
      a prime function, but that such studies would be monitored if necessary. A controlled trial&#xD;
      of Factor IX concentrates therapy was strongly advised by the DBDR Advisory Committee.&#xD;
      Accordingly, during fiscal year 1978, a protocol for a double-blind control study was&#xD;
      developed by the Factor VIII inhibitor group. The trial began in the spring of 1978, and the&#xD;
      intervention terminated about one year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind study; patients served as their own controls. A total of 51 patients each&#xD;
      received a single large dose of Konyne, Proplex, or diluted albumin (as a control). Joint&#xD;
      bleeding of the elbow, knee, and ankle was evaluated six hours after each dose.&#xD;
