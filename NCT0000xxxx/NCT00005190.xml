      To create a registry of all Oregon children undergoing surgical repair of congenital heart&#xD;
      disease since 1958 in order to determine mortality, morbidity, and disability after surgery&#xD;
      and to assess the safety of pregnancy in women with corrected congenital heart disease and&#xD;
      the risk of prematurity and occurrence of congenital heart defects in offspring.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1960, surgical advances have led to correction of congenital heart defects in children&#xD;
      who otherwise may not have achieved maturity. Consequently, it became increasingly important&#xD;
      to understand the long-term morbidity, mortality and functional status of these patients.&#xD;
      Because of the tremendous outlay of time, money and personnel devoted to prolonging the lives&#xD;
      of children with congenital heart defects, it was vital to examine the accomplishment of&#xD;
      long-term goals: achievement of a normal lifespan as a functioning, effective member of&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative, operative, and postoperative data for each patient were entered into the&#xD;
      registry data base at chart review. Follow-up for each patient was gathered by mail&#xD;
      questionnaire, telephone survey, and the National Death Index. Questionnaires assessed&#xD;
      morbidity, functional status, and reproduction. Pregnancy and major events were confirmed&#xD;
      from physicians' records. Follow-up for tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, and&#xD;
      atrial septal defect was conducted in years 1, 3, and 5, and for transposition of the great&#xD;
      arteries, aortic stenosis, pulmonic stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, and coarctation of&#xD;
      the aorta in years 2 and 4. Chart review was completed in year 2 and cases were then&#xD;
      identified prospectively. Actuarial analysis and Cox proportional hazards models determined&#xD;
      mortality, major morbidity, and their risk factors. Reproductive data were analyzed per years&#xD;
      of fertility for the cohort, and compared to Oregon population statistics. During 1988-1989,&#xD;
      chart review and data abstraction were completed for children having surgical corrections&#xD;
      from 1958-1987 for the eight defects under study. Also, during 1988-1989, children undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery for the eight defects were added to the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 1993 to sustain and expand the registry of all Oregon children 18&#xD;
      years of age or younger undergoing surgical repair from 1958 to the present of 14 major&#xD;
      congenital heart defects: tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial&#xD;
      septal defect (ASD), coarctation of the aorta, pulmonic stenosis (PS), aortic stenosis (AS),&#xD;
      transposition of the great arteries, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), tricuspid atresia (TA),&#xD;
      total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular&#xD;
      septum (PA), PA with VSD, partial atrioventricular canal (AVC), and complete AVC. The first&#xD;
      eight defects were included in the registry: TOF (n =438). VSD (n =402), ASD (n =496), COA (n&#xD;
      =479), AS (n = 175), PS (n = 200), TGA (n = 169), and PDA (n = 533). All cases of surgical&#xD;
      treatment of TA, TAPVR, PA, PA with VSD, and partial and complete AVC from 1958 to the&#xD;
      present were added to the registry. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative data for each&#xD;
      patient were entered into the database from chart review. Each hospital was visited twice&#xD;
      yearly to ascertain new cases. Individuals were followed every two years for intercurrent&#xD;
      events by mailed questionnaire or phone interview. Questionnaires and interviews assessed&#xD;
      major morbidity, functional status, and reproduction. Pregnancy, major events, and recurrent&#xD;
      CHD were confirmed by medical records. Actuarial analysis and the Cox proportional hazards&#xD;
      model determined mortality, morbidity, and their risk factors, and compared observed survival&#xD;
      with expected population survival. Reproductive data were analyzed per years of fertility for&#xD;
      cohort, and compared to Oregon population statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
