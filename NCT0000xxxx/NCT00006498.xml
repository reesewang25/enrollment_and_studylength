      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiologies of the rising prevalence and morbidity of asthma are not well understood.&#xD;
      Knowledge gaps are particularly significant with respect to adult-onset asthma. The role of&#xD;
      stress in the expression of asthma is largely unexplored in large-scale, prospective,&#xD;
      epidemiologic studies and such investigation has been identified as a priority by a recent&#xD;
      NHLBI expert panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study prospectively examines the association between a specific chronic life stressor&#xD;
      (i.e., intimate violence exposure) and adult asthma in women participating in the Nurses'&#xD;
      Health Study II cohort. Emerging epidemiologic data suggest that exposure to intimate&#xD;
      violence is a pervasive chronic life stressor associated with adverse impact on womens'&#xD;
      psychological and physical health. Traumatic stress such as that related to intimate violence&#xD;
      exposure has been associated with neuroendocrine changes known to cause alterations in&#xD;
      neuroendocrine and immune functions important to the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      including asthma. The investigators are testing the hypothesis that women exposed to&#xD;
      high-level chronic stress (violence) will be at greater risk for asthma development than&#xD;
      women with low-level stress (violence) exposure. The influence of chronic stress on&#xD;
      neuroendocrine and immune function as reflected in morning cortisol expression, for the&#xD;
      former, and cytokine profiles and IgE production (T-helper cell polarization), for the&#xD;
      latter, will also be examined in a nested case control fashion among these women.&#xD;
