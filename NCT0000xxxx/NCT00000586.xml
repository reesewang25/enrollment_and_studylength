      To assess the efficacy and safety of orally administered hydroxyurea in the treatment of&#xD;
      painful crises in patients with sickle cell anemia.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the fact that advances have been made in the management or prevention of some of&#xD;
      the complications of sickle cell disease, the management of the most common complication--the&#xD;
      painful crisis--is still unsatisfactory, and appropriate methods for its prevention are&#xD;
      unknown. The morbidity associated with a painful crisis is much more than the suffering from&#xD;
      pain alone. The interference with a normal lifestyle, the resulting obstacles to obtaining an&#xD;
      education and holding a job, the risk of narcotics addiction, the cost of multiple&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and the financial impact on the family and the individual must all be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) study showed that there is&#xD;
      an association between multiple pain events and early death in young adults. If this&#xD;
      association is true, then MSH has the potential to not only reduce morbidity but mortality as&#xD;
      well. The CSSCD study has shown that over 50 percent of patients with sickle cell disease&#xD;
      have at least one crisis per year, and a considerable number have more. These episodes are&#xD;
      believed to occur as a result of hemoglobin S within the red cells leading to rigid,&#xD;
      non-deformable cells which can no longer traverse the microvasculature and as a result&#xD;
      produce obstruction with consequent pain, ischemia, and tissue necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous approaches to the therapy of this group of disorders have included: attempts to&#xD;
      modify the hemoglobin molecule so as to prevent polymerization; the use of vasoreactive&#xD;
      drugs; and increasing red cell volume. All of these attempts have been abandoned either&#xD;
      because of their inefficacy, toxicity, or impracticality. Chronic exchange transfusion&#xD;
      programs have been of limited usefulness because of high rates of isoimmunization, iron&#xD;
      overload, and risk of transmission of hepatitis and retroviral disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the present study draws its substance from the observation that patients&#xD;
      with higher levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) (particularly the Saudi Arabian group), and&#xD;
      infants who also have high Hb F levels have fewer crises. Several myelosuppressive drugs,&#xD;
      such as 5-azacytidine and hydroxyurea, have been shown to increase Hb F production. The work&#xD;
      with 5-azacytidine has had to be abandoned because of the known risk of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies by the investigators and others have shown convincingly that Hb F levels&#xD;
      can be increased by administering hydroxyurea to patients over a several month period without&#xD;
      producing dangerous levels of myelosuppression. The patients have also had a rise in their&#xD;
      red cell life span and hematocrit. Further, it has been reported that these patients had a&#xD;
      dramatic decrease in crisis frequency. This agent is readily available to all physicians, and&#xD;
      there is evidence that it is being used without adequate justification and, possibly, without&#xD;
      adequate monitoring. The timing of this study is therefore critical to ensure that an&#xD;
      adequate answer to the question of efficacy is obtained and the risk of inappropriate use&#xD;
      minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I has concluded. Phase II, also concluded, was a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial. Patients in the Phase II trial were recruited from 21 clinics and&#xD;
      randomized to receive hydroxyurea or placebo. The hydroxyurea was gradually increased from an&#xD;
      initial dose of 15 mg/kg to the maximal level tolerated by each patient in order to maximize&#xD;
      red blood cell hemoglobin F(Hb F) content without undue marrow suppression. Changes in Hb F&#xD;
      production were monitored in each of the two groups by a variety of laboratory tests. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint was a comparison of crisis rates in the treated and control groups. Painful&#xD;
      crises were defined as pain lasting longer than four hours, requiring parenteral narcotics&#xD;
      for relief, including chest syndrome but excluding ankle ulcer pain. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      included changes in pain severity and duration, psychosocial status, complications of the&#xD;
      disease, and reasons for non-compliance with either regimen. Patients were followed for two&#xD;
      to three years depending on when they entered the study. Because of the mutagenic nature of&#xD;
      hydroxyurea, the use of contraception was a requirement of admission to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was stopped early, on January 14, 1995, instead of in May 1995. The Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board determined that daily doses of hydroxyurea reduced the frequency of painful&#xD;
      episodes and hospital admissions for those crises by about 50 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in 1996, a five year follow-up of the adult patients in MSH was initiated. The&#xD;
      purpose was to ascertain the long-term effects of hydroxyurea in this patient population.&#xD;
      Patients were followed annually to determine health status, quality of life, incidence of&#xD;
      malignancies, and birth defects in their offspring. In addition, mortality rates were&#xD;
      determined so that a comparison could be made between this cohort and the mortality data from&#xD;
      the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) adult cohort and the normal&#xD;
      African-American population mortality data. The follow-up was conducted in three phases.&#xD;
      Phase I or the Planning Phase in which the final protocol was developed, lasted three months.&#xD;
      Phase II, patient entry between March 1996 and June 1996 and patient follow-up, extended from&#xD;
      the fourth to the 48th month. Phase III, patient exit and data analysis, were carried out&#xD;
      during the final nine months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DSMB stopped MSH Phase III early because the study showed that hydroxyurea substantially&#xD;
      reduced the frequency of vaso-occlusive (painful) crises.&#xD;
