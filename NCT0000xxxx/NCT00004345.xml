      OBJECTIVES: I. Examine the concentration of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and other n-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids in plasma, erythrocyte, and adipose tissue in patients with various forms of retinitis&#xD;
      pigmentosa and Usher syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the synthesis and catabolism of DHA from linolenic acid in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the synthesis, absorption, and catabolism of DHA under different dietary&#xD;
      conditions in these patients.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients may participate in one or more of the arms of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I (adipose tissue study): Adipose tissue is collected from the buttocks of patients with&#xD;
      Usher II retinitis pigmentosa (RP), patients with non-Usher RP, and control subjects. Dietary&#xD;
      histories are obtained from all patients and subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II (isotope study): Patients meeting the same criteria as in arm I receive oral&#xD;
      D5-labeled linolenic acid and oral D4-labeled linolenic acid that is dissolved in oil and&#xD;
      incorporated into foods. Subjects must avoid eating fish and shellfish during the 35 days of&#xD;
      the isotope study. Blood samples are collected at 0, 8, 24, and 48 hours, daily on days 3-7,&#xD;
      and then on days 10, 18, and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm III (flaxseed oil feeding): Patients with all types of RP and control subjects receive&#xD;
      flaxseed oil, a form of linolenic acid, for 12 weeks. Subjects may also receive high oleic&#xD;
      safflower oil or olive oil as a control fat for 12 weeks. Subjects complete a diet history at&#xD;
      the end of each fatty acid supplementation period. All subjects must follow a diet free of&#xD;
      seafood and fish oil supplements.&#xD;
