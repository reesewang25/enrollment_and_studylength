  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of long-term intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB)&#xD;
      treatment when used as an adjunct to the overall care of ambulatory outpatients with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease. The evaluation compared the use of IPPB with use of a powered&#xD;
      nebulizer.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent positive pressure breathing may be a useful adjunct therapy for patients with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is, however, quite expensive; moreover, in 1976 its&#xD;
      treatment efficacy had not been determined. Although the effectiveness of IPPB had been&#xD;
      previously studied, the influence of long-term treatment was not known for the following&#xD;
      reasons: The individuals studied had been too few and were not randomly assigned to treatment&#xD;
      groups, the patient groups were not homogeneous and their clinical and functional status were&#xD;
      not well-documented, and precise descriptions of the manner in which IPPB was administered&#xD;
      were not recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these facts, a conference on the Scientific Basis of Respiratory Therapy,&#xD;
      co-sponsored by the American Thoracic Society and the Division of Lung Diseases, issued a&#xD;
      recommendation to develop a controlled clinical study of IPPB. Contracts were awarded to five&#xD;
      clinical centers and a data center in November 1976. Planning of the trial ended in November&#xD;
      1977. Recruitment began in April 1978 for the 985 individuals who took part in this trial and&#xD;
      ended in October 1980. Patients enrolled after March 31, 1980, were followed for 30 months&#xD;
      instead of 36 months. Follow-up was completed in May 1983.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, fixed sample of 985 patients. Eligible patients were assigned to a treatment&#xD;
      group using intermittent positive pressure breathing or to a control group using a powered&#xD;
      nebulizer for treatment 3-4 times a day. Treatments continued for 3 years. Endpoints related&#xD;
      to quality of life and respiratory function and capability.&#xD;
