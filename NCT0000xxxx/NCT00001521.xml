  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was developed to determine if a combination of four drugs (flutamide,&#xD;
      testolactone, reduced hydrocortisone dose, and fludrocortisone) can normalize growth in&#xD;
      children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take 60 children, boys and girls and divide them into 2 groups based on the&#xD;
      medications given. Group one will receive the new four- drug combination. Group two will&#xD;
      receive the standard treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (hydrocortisone and&#xD;
      fludrocortisone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The boys in group one will take the medication until the age of 14 at which time they will&#xD;
      stop taking the four drug combination and begin receiving the standard treatment for&#xD;
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Girls in group one will take the four drug combination until&#xD;
      the age of 13, at which time they will stop and begin receiving the standard treatment for&#xD;
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia plus flutamide. Flutamide will be given to the girls until six&#xD;
      months after their first menstrual period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the children will be followed until they reach their final adult height. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of the treatment will be determined by measuring the patient's adult height,&#xD;
      body mass index, and bone density. &lt;TAB&gt;...&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that the regimen of flutamide (an antiandrogen), testolactone or&#xD;
      letrozole (an inhibitor of androgen-to-estrogen conversion), and reduced hydrocortisone dose&#xD;
      can normalize the growth and adult stature of children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia,&#xD;
      and can avoid the complications of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosage, 60 children with&#xD;
      this disorder will be randomized to receive either the above regimen or conventional&#xD;
      treatment until they have reached age 13 years in a girl or age 14 in a boy. After these ages&#xD;
      boys will receive the conventional treatment and girls will receive conventional treatment&#xD;
      plus flutamide. In girls, flutamide will be continued until 6 months after menarche. All&#xD;
      children will be followed until they have attained final adult height. The principal outcome&#xD;
      measures will be adult height, body mass index, and bone density.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be boys with bone ages 2 to 13 years and girls with bone ages 2 to 11 years&#xD;
        with classic 21-hydroxylase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must either not yet have undergone pubertal activation of the&#xD;
        hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, or, if pubertal activation has occurred, must be&#xD;
        receiving an LHRH agonist to suppress secondary central precocious puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children with a bone age of 1 to 2 years may enroll in the protocol for optimization of&#xD;
        conventional therapy, but will not be randomized to a study arm until the bone age reaches&#xD;
        2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children who have concurrent illnesses requiring glucocorticoid treatment (such as severe&#xD;
        asthma), or requiring drugs that markedly alter hydrocortisone metabolism (such as&#xD;
        anticonvulsants), and children who cannot be brought into reasonable control with&#xD;
        conventional treatment (an unusual occurrence).&#xD;
