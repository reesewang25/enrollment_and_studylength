  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether serum insulin is a risk factor for coronary heart disease morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and whether dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is a risk factor for coronary&#xD;
      heart disease mortality. Also, to ascertain the determinants of serum insulin levels among&#xD;
      middle-aged men.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1972, the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial began recruiting 12,866 men, ages 35 to&#xD;
      57, selected for elevation of one or more risk factors but free from coronary heart disease&#xD;
      and followed them for an average of seven years after randomization to a risk factor&#xD;
      modification group or to a control group referred to their own physicians for treatment. The&#xD;
      serum from MRFIT had been stored since 1972. Detailed follow-up for the cohort was completed&#xD;
      through 1985 and was extended through 1988 using the National Death Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of insulin as a major risk factor for atherosclerosis resurfaced in the 1980s and&#xD;
      was the subject of much research at the basic science, clinical, and epidemiological levels.&#xD;
      The MRFIT serum data base probably was the only remaining such serum bank in the United&#xD;
      States that could test the relationship between insulin levels and coronary heart disease&#xD;
      mortality that included detailed measurements of other major cardiovascular risk factors, as&#xD;
      well as both baseline and two-hour post-load glucose levels in a predominantly non-diabetic&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHEAS is the most abundant circulating steroid hormone in man and is readily converted to&#xD;
      DHEA which is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the&#xD;
      rate limiting enzyme of the pentose cycle. Several studies suggest a key role of DHEAS in&#xD;
      obesity, lipid metabolism, cellular proliferation, and atherosclerosis. Barrett-Connor in&#xD;
      1986 reported that low levels of this hormone were a risk factor for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      in men. Other studies report that administration of DHEAS to laboratory animals appears to&#xD;
      delay aging, prevent obesity, and lower serum cholesterol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nested case-control study was conducted using the stored blood serum. Laboratory&#xD;
      measurements were done blindly without knowledge of whether the specimen was from a case or a&#xD;
      control. Insulin was measured in all 600 specimens. DHEAS was measured in 200 cases and 100&#xD;
      controls. The means and distribution of insulin or DHEAS levels were compared between cases&#xD;
      and controls. The analysis was done separately for the coronary heart disease deaths and&#xD;
      surviving myocardial infarction cases and, if there were no differences between the case&#xD;
      groups, they were pooled for comparison with the controls. The relationships were determined&#xD;
      among the potential confounders, coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and serum&#xD;
      insulin or DHEAS levels. This analysis also included data on baseline serum cholesterol,&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, serum thiocyanate, HDL and LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, basal metabolic index, fasting and one-hour blood glucose.&#xD;
      Alcohol intake, physical activity, pulmonary function, and education were also evaluated. The&#xD;
      relationships among insulin or DHEAS and coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality were&#xD;
      evaluated after adjusting for possible confounders.&#xD;
