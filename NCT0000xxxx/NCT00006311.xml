  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the role of reduced vagal control of heart rate in the increased risk of cardiac&#xD;
      mortality associated with anxiety in a population with established coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD). A second objective is to determine whether the effects of anxiety are independent of&#xD;
      the effects of depression.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States,&#xD;
      despite risk factor reduction and technological advances in treatment options. Prospective&#xD;
      studies implicate chronic anxiety as an independent risk factor for fatal coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. In particular, anxiety increases the risk of sudden cardiac death substantially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine hundred and fifty CAD patients were recruited for this study from patients hospitalized&#xD;
      for elective cardiac catheterization. Anxiety was measured by the Hospital Anxiety Scale, the&#xD;
      Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Crown-Crisp Phobic Anxiety Scale. Symptoms of&#xD;
      depression were measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hospital&#xD;
      Depression Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Vagal control of heart rate was&#xD;
      determined using power spectral analysis to measure two indices of vagal control:&#xD;
      baroreceptor-mediated vagal reflex cardiac control, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia.&#xD;
      Patients were followed at 6 months, l year, 2 years, and 3 years postcatheterization, and&#xD;
      cardiac mortality data were obtained, including non-sudden and sudden cardiac death. The data&#xD;
      generated by this study were used to examine the involvement of impaired vagal cardiac&#xD;
      control in the risk of fatal coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death associated with&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the study examined: (1) the relationship between anxiety and cardiac mortality;&#xD;
      (2) the relationship between anxiety and vagal control; (3) the role played by reduced vagal&#xD;
      control in mediating anxiety-related risk; and (4) the relationship between depression, vagal&#xD;
      control and cardiac risk. Findings of a relationship between anxiety, reduced vagal control&#xD;
      and sudden cardiac death would suggest the potential importance of early intervention in&#xD;
      cardiac patients with anxiety disorders and would underscore the benefit of aggressive&#xD;
      monitoring of arrhythmias in this population, which may ultimately translate to reduced&#xD;
      mortality rates.&#xD;
