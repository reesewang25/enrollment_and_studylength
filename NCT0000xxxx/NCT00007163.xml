  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of an experimental drug called J695 for&#xD;
      treating patients with Crohn's disease-a long-term recurring inflammation of the small and&#xD;
      large intestine. This disease is currently treated with steroids, sulfasalazine (Azulfidine),&#xD;
      5-ASA drugs (Pentasa, Asacol), immune suppressants, antibiotics, and an antibody against&#xD;
      TNF-alpha. Despite the number and variety of available therapies for Crohn's disease, many&#xD;
      patients do not respond adequately to treatment or they develop severe side effects from the&#xD;
      medicines. Therefore, new treatments must be developed. J695 is an antibody that is identical&#xD;
      to a human antibody but chemically changed so that it can attach to and eliminate an&#xD;
      inflammatory chemical made by the body called interleukin-12 (IL-12). Animal studies have&#xD;
      shown that eliminating IL-12 with an antibody can prevent inflammation in the gut and can&#xD;
      also heal inflammation that has already developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had Crohn's disease for at least 4 months may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, blood and urine tests, stool analysis and&#xD;
      possibly a review of medical records. They will complete a Crohn's Disease Activity Index&#xD;
      Questionnaire for 7 days. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this group will receive an injection of either J695 or placebo (a solution that&#xD;
      does not contain any active medicine) under the skin on day 1 of the study, on day 29, and&#xD;
      then weekly for a total of seven injections. After the last injection, patients will be&#xD;
      followed for an additional 18 weeks. They will be monitored periodically throughout the study&#xD;
      with physical examinations, disease activity index scores, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group 2 will receive an injection of J695 or placebo on day 1 of the study and&#xD;
      then weekly for a total of six injections. They will be followed for an additional 18 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored as described above for group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to undergo additional tests as part of a sub-study in this&#xD;
      protocol. These include colonoscopies to examine changes in inflammation in the gut and blood&#xD;
      tests to analyze changes in the cells and body chemicals that affect the inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of and the clinical response to a human&#xD;
      monoclonal anti-interleukin-12 antibody (J695) administered to patients with Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, an incurable, chronic, relapsing inflammation of the small and large&#xD;
      intestine, affects approximately 500,000 people in the United States. The disease is&#xD;
      characterized by full-thickness involvement of the gut wall leading to episodes of abdominal&#xD;
      pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, weight loss and complications such as bowel obstruction,&#xD;
      fistula formation and extraintestinal manifestations. The rationale for this study is based&#xD;
      on two compelling observations. First, despite the standard therapeutic use of steroids,&#xD;
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, antimetabolite immunosuppressants (6-MP, methotrexate), and&#xD;
      early agents of the emerging biologics class of drugs (anti-TNF alpha antibodies, e.g.), the&#xD;
      treatment of Crohn's disease is still troubled by loss of effectiveness of standard therapy&#xD;
      over time, outright nonresponsiveness, and serious medication side effects. For these reasons&#xD;
      newer agents for the treatment of Crohn's disease need to be developed and tested. Second,&#xD;
      studies in both animals and humans support a central role for IL-12 in the gut inflammatory&#xD;
      response in Crohn's disease. Administration of anti-IL-12 antibodies in animal models has&#xD;
      prevented inducible or ameliorated established colitis. For these reasons IL-12 is an&#xD;
      appropriate therapeutic target for the treatment of Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to measure the toxicity and clinical effect of two doses of anti-IL-12&#xD;
      (J695) administered subcutaneously to patients with moderately active Crohn's disease. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure is the rate and severity of adverse events. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures include J695 pharmacodynamics, incidence of anti-J695 antibodies, and clinical&#xD;
      response. A separate substudy at the NIH will measure gut lymphocyte apoptosis and gut and&#xD;
      peripheral blood cytokine responses to study drug as well as endoscopic and histologic&#xD;
      response to treatment. Our short-term goal is to assure good tolerance of anti-IL-12&#xD;
      treatment regimens in Crohn's disease patients and observe a beneficial clinical response.&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to establish anti-IL-12 as an effective alternative with&#xD;
      a low risk profile in the therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease.&#xD;
