      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating elderly women&#xD;
      who have metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of gemcitabine in the treatment of elderly&#xD;
      women with metastatic breast cancer. II. Evaluate the quality of life in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 1 hour weekly for 7 consecutive weeks in an 8&#xD;
      week course. Treatment then continues weekly for 3 consecutive weeks in 4 week courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to&#xD;
      treatment and then every 12 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then&#xD;
      every 6 months until year 5, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.&#xD;
