    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if regular rinsing with chlorhexidine is effective&#xD;
      as a long-term preventive method for reducing the incidence of tooth loss in low income older&#xD;
      adults. The true end-point of the study is tooth loss after five years of regular rinsing&#xD;
      with chlorhexidine or a placebo; surrogate endpoints are periodontal disease, root and&#xD;
      coronal decay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;TEETH&quot; is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, supervised by a Data &amp; Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board, designed to provide unequivocal evidence regarding the impact of regular&#xD;
      rinsing 0.12% chlorhexidine solution on tooth loss in low income, community-dwelling older&#xD;
      adults who are irregular users of dental services. Of the 1101 subjects enrolled in the study&#xD;
      in Seattle, WA and Vancouver, B.C., one/half have been assigned to the active rinse&#xD;
      condition; the other half to the placebo rinse which looks and tastes like the chlorhexidine&#xD;
      rinse but does not have the active ingredient. Subjects receive two bottles of rinse every&#xD;
      six months; the first to be used daily for one month, the second weekly for five months.&#xD;
      Reminder calls are designed to help subjects maintain this rinse regimen. Subjects return&#xD;
      yearly to research clinics at each participating university, where they are examined by a&#xD;
      dentist who is trained in clinical research methodology and calibrated annually. The purpose&#xD;
      of these visits is to examine subjects for tooth loss (followed by contacts with extracting&#xD;
      dentists to determine the dentist's reasons for extracting the tooth), pocket depth,&#xD;
      recession, caries and restorations on root and coronal surfaces. Interviews are also&#xD;
      conducted annually with participants to assess health status, health behaviors, and oral&#xD;
      health quality of life. A panoramic radiograph was taken at baseline of each subject and is&#xD;
      to be done again at the five-year (final) yearly exam. These radiographs are used to confirm&#xD;
      tooth loss and possible reasons for extractions&#xD;
