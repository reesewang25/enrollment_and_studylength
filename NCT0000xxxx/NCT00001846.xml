      This protocol is designed to provide a mechanism for the Department of Transfusion Medicine,&#xD;
      Clinical Center to collect and process blood components from paid, healthy volunteer donors&#xD;
      for distribution to NIH intramural investigators and FDA researchers for in vitro laboratory&#xD;
      use. Donors meeting research donor eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate blood and&#xD;
      blood components by standard phlebotomy and apheresis techniques. The investigational nature&#xD;
      of the studies in which their blood will be used, and the risks and discomforts of the&#xD;
      donation process will be carefully explained to the donors, and a signed informed consent&#xD;
      document will be obtained. Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule&#xD;
      based on the duration and discomfort of the donation. NIH and FDA investigators requesting&#xD;
      blood components for research use will be required to submit an electronic (Web-based) memo&#xD;
      of request, briefly describing the nature of the research, and providing assurance that&#xD;
      samples provided through this protocol will be used solely for in vitro and not for in vivo&#xD;
      research. This protocol also provides a detailed schema for careful and frequent laboratory&#xD;
      safety monitoring of repeat research apheresis donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood components for research use will be distributed with a unique product number, and the&#xD;
      DTM principal and associate investigators will serve as the custodians of the code that links&#xD;
      the product with a donor s identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the blood&#xD;
      and components collected in this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol, and&#xD;
      is not possible to describe, since it involves basic investigative efforts in greater than&#xD;
      170 different NIH and FDA laboratories. The intent of this protocol is not to approve the&#xD;
      research itself, but to provide adequate and complete informed consent for the donor, and to&#xD;
      assure that the education, counseling, and protection of the study subjects (research blood&#xD;
      donors) is performed in accordance with IRB, OHSR, OPRR and other applicable Federal&#xD;
      regulatory standards...&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -NIH and FDA intramural investigators performing in vitro studies involving human blood&#xD;
      components have a need for a steady, reliable, consistent source of these blood components,&#xD;
      preferably derived from screened donors documented to be free of potential&#xD;
      transfusion-transmissible diseases.&#xD;

           from paid, healthy volunteer donors for distribution to NIH intramural investigators and&#xD;
           FDA laboratories for in vitro research use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide adequate and complete informed consent to the donors of research blood&#xD;
           samples, and to assure that the education, counseling, and protection of the study&#xD;
           subjects (research blood donors) from research risks is performed in accordance with&#xD;
           IRB, OPRR and other applicable Federal regulatory standards.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The investigational nature of the studies in which their blood will be used, and the&#xD;
           risks and discomforts of the donation process will be carefully explained to the donors,&#xD;
           and a signed informed consent document will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule based on the duration&#xD;
           and discomfort of the donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIH and FDA investigators requesting blood components for research use will be required&#xD;
           to submit an electronic (Web-based) memo of request, briefly describing the nature of&#xD;
           the research, and providing assurance that samples provided through this protocol will&#xD;
           be used solely for in vitro and not for in vivo research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood components for research use will be distributed with a unique product number, and&#xD;
           the DTM principal and associate investigators will serve as the custodians of the code&#xD;
           that links the product with a donor s identity.&#xD;

             defined in the AABB Donor Education Materials distributed to all donors. Deferral&#xD;
             periods for high-risk activities (MSM, IV drug use or receipt of money or drugs in&#xD;
             exchange for sex) will not exceed the corresponding deferral period as defined for&#xD;
             allogeneic blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of malaria in the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors who have a family history of CJD, donors who have undergone tattooing or body&#xD;
             piercing, donors who have received a graft such as bone, skin or dura mater, donors&#xD;
             who are taking finasteride or retinoids, and donors who have had sexual contact within&#xD;
             the past 12 months with a person who has symptomatic hepatitis C infection or donors&#xD;
             who have lived with a person who has hepatitis in the last 12 months, are similarly&#xD;
             eligible for research-use only donations on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors who have traveled to Europe, Africa, Asia, and areas of South America, who are&#xD;
             rendered ineligible for allogeneic donation due to malarial risk, Zika risk and vCJD&#xD;
             risk, are eligible for research donations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors with a history of repeat false positive HTLV I/II, who are rendered ineligible&#xD;
             for allogeneic donation, are eligible for research donations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors with a positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) only, without&#xD;
             other positive infectious disease markers,are eligible for research donations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors with HLA antibodies are eligible for research donations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors who have received an experimental drug, agent, or vaccine, and who are referred&#xD;
             for a research blood, plasma or leukocyte collection, specifically because they were&#xD;
             given this drug, agent, or vaccine, are acceptable only if their research product is&#xD;
             collected for use by the PI who administered the experimental drug, agent, or vaccine.&#xD;
             Otherwise, they are deferred for one year after receiving an experimental drug, agent,&#xD;
             or vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors who have received a xenotransplant are eligible for research donations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Granulocyte donors may not receive dexamethasone if they have poorly controlled&#xD;
             hypertension or diabetes, or if they have a history of cataracts. Hetastarch (also&#xD;
             known as hydroxyethyl starch or &quot;HES&quot;) and dexamethasone may elevate blood pressure&#xD;
             and raise blood glucose levels, and repetitive steroid administration may increase the&#xD;
             risk of posterior subcapsular cataract formation or progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Granulocyte donors must have an estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate of &gt;&#xD;
             45ml/min/1.73m^2.&#xD;

             coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Investigators are informed that eligibility standards for research donors differ from those&#xD;
        for transfusion donors through an electronic &quot;User Agreement&quot; which they electronically&#xD;
        sign when they register to receive blood components on this protocol.&#xD;
