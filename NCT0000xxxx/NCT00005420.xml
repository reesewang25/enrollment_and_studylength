      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern treatments for cardiovascular disease that enhance survival have increased the need to&#xD;
      understand and improve corresponding aspects of quality of life. The increasing interest in&#xD;
      prevention and health promotion in contemporary cardiovascular care emphasizes reducing risk&#xD;
      factors that have major behavioral components, such as smoking, diet, and exercise. Personal&#xD;
      and social resources and psychological coping strategies are associated with quality of life&#xD;
      both directly and indirectly, through such positive health behaviors. Findings from this&#xD;
      research provided an essential foundation for continued investigation focusing on longer-term&#xD;
      changes in health status and quality of life in a planned ten-year follow-up with the present&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study developed and tested an integrative prospective structural equation model of the&#xD;
      interrelationships among social resources, coping strategies, positive health behaviors, and&#xD;
      quality of life in cardiovascular disease over a four-year time-period. It also contrasted&#xD;
      predictive findings relating to cardiac illness, stroke, and hypertension with predictive&#xD;
      findings from matched-control groups of healthy individuals and individuals with very serious&#xD;
      (cancer) and moderately serious (arthritis) noncardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research involved secondary data analysis with a large sample of individuals surveyed&#xD;
      through the Center for Health Care Evaluation at the Stanford University Medical School. The&#xD;
      sample included individuals between the ages of 55 and 65 who had used medical services in&#xD;
      two large medical centers. Extensive psychosocial and physical health data were available&#xD;
      from mail-out inventories at three points in time over a four- year period. Of eligible&#xD;
      respondents contacts, 92 percent agreed to participate in the initial survey, and 89 percent&#xD;
      (1884) of them provided complete data. Participation in one-year and four-year follow-ups&#xD;
      approached 90 percent of surviving respondents from the previous survey. At the initial&#xD;
      testing, 411 respondents (22 percent) reported diagnosed cardiac illness (excluding stroke&#xD;
      and hypertension), 83 respondents (5 percent) reported diagnosed strokes, and 593 respondents&#xD;
      (31 percent) reported diagnosed hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data base at all three measurement times included extensive information on the quality of&#xD;
      life, positive health behaviors, personal and social resources, and coping strategies.&#xD;
      Computerized hospital medical records were available for one-third of the sample, and were&#xD;
      used to evaluate the reliability of subjects' self-reports of medical conditions and health&#xD;
      status. Group comparisons were made on two dimensions: illness type and post-illness time&#xD;
      interval. Longitudinal analyses were used to examine causal influences on positive health&#xD;
      behaviors and quality of life, and to develop and test an integrative predictive model.&#xD;
