  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a longitudinal study of the natural history of types III and IV osteogenesis&#xD;
      imperfecta for children age birth to 25 years. A consistent objective throughout this study&#xD;
      is to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the natural history and progression of the&#xD;
      multiple secondary features of osteogenesis imperfecta. In addition to radiographic, bone&#xD;
      density, physical rehabilitation and dental manifestations, we will assess the&#xD;
      cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and audiology systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major objectives of this protocol focus on rehabilitation and physical therapy studies,&#xD;
      pulmonary and cardiovascular function, neurological features, audiological studies and&#xD;
      genetic and molecular biology aspects of OI. A major objective in this study is to expand the&#xD;
      intensive rehabilitation and physical therapy studies of children with types III and IV OI.&#xD;
      This objective continues the work that has been done in the Rehabilitation Department of the&#xD;
      Clinical Center for the past 20 years on these patients. However, the focus of this objective&#xD;
      is changing to include studies of scoliosis and its effect on function, studies of chest&#xD;
      proportions and rib deformities, and studies of nonkinetic variables related to motor&#xD;
      performance, such as temperament, competence, coping, and resilience in children with OI. The&#xD;
      second major objective is the longitudinal study of pulmonary function in children with types&#xD;
      III and IV OI. It is well known that cardiopulmonary complications are a major cause of&#xD;
      disability and death in adults with OI; the developmental patterns of these complications,&#xD;
      and whether susceptible individuals can be identified in childhood, is unknown. The third&#xD;
      major objective of these studies of secondary features is to determine the incidence of&#xD;
      basilar invagination and develop a monitoring and management plan for this neurological&#xD;
      feature. Next, the prevalence, severity, age of onset and genotypic/phenotypic correlation of&#xD;
      hearing loss among children with types II and IV OI remains poorly understood; therefore, the&#xD;
      study of audiological features is our fourth major objective. The final major objective in&#xD;
      this study is the continued study of the genetic and molecular biology aspect of OI. Patients&#xD;
      will have skin biopsies for collagen studies at the biochemical and molecular level. Parents&#xD;
      will have blood drawn for determination of mosaic status for the mutation that causes their&#xD;
      child s OI. These studies will provide further information on genotype/phenotype correlation&#xD;
      and other variables in OI genetics. As appropriate, bone chips from emergency or elective&#xD;
      surgical procedures on the participants will be used to study osteoblast function in OI.&#xD;

    <description>For the younger children, we evaluated bone density, physical function, dental manifestations, and the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and audiologic systems. Visits for children under 5 will be every 4 months. These assessments will continue when the participants turn 5, with the addition of the neurological system. All children ages 5-18 years will be evaluated at the Clinical Center every 6 months. Ages 19- will be seen on an annual basis</description>

        Children will be recruited from the United States. This recruitment will be accomplished by&#xD;
        our contacts with the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, parent-to-parent communication,&#xD;
        and outside referrals from other health care providers&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will be recruited from the United States. This recruitment will be accomplished by&#xD;
        our contacts with the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, parent-to-parent communication,&#xD;
        and outside referrals from other health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no exclusionary criteria related to race or gender for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children enrolled in this study will be limited to those with Sillence Types III and IV OI,&#xD;
        as determined by clinical and genetic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients age birth to 10 years at enrollment will be considered for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children who have not had skin biopsy done for collagen analysis at another facility are&#xD;
        preferred for participation in this study. However, previous skin biopsy at another&#xD;
        facility will not preclude participation in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children who can be expected to attain at least some degree of ambulatory skill or have&#xD;
        high potential for achieving independent locomotion with assistive technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children who are clinically too severe to benefit from this program are defined by the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The ratio of head circumference age (the age for which the child's head or body size&#xD;
             falls at the 50th percentile) to body length age (the age for which the child's length&#xD;
             falls at the 50th percentile) is 7:1 or greater;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Children who are 24 months of age, and who are unable to sit unsupported for 60&#xD;
             seconds and are unable to demonstrate the ability to prop themselves on upper&#xD;
             extremities in the prone position;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Children who have other significant medical problems, especially severe&#xD;
             cardiopulmonary problems, which have an impact on their physical development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Compliance with the visit schedule, maintenance of the physical therapy program, and&#xD;
        completion of the measurement tools are central to our analysis of the outcomes of this&#xD;
        study. Failure to comply with these conditions will constitute exclusion criteria.&#xD;
