      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health impact of disordered breathing during sleep among middle-aged and older men and&#xD;
      women in the general population had not been well studied, and the need for treating&#xD;
      relatively mild degrees of sleep-disordered breathing was unknown in 1994. The study was the&#xD;
      first population study which examined the effect of sleep-disordered breathing on these&#xD;
      health outcomes. The study sought to establish the prevalence of clinically important&#xD;
      sleep-disordered breathing among middle-aged and older men and women and to provide&#xD;
      quantitative data to serve as the basis for selecting patients for screening and deciding&#xD;
      which patients might benefit from therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluated the hypothesis that clinically inapparent sleep-disordered breathing was&#xD;
      associated with blood pressure elevation, impairment of health-related quality of life, and&#xD;
      depression. The study used the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study (NAS)&#xD;
      population, which consisted of approximately 1,700 community-dwelling-men who returned for&#xD;
      examination every three years. Respiratory function was assessed during sleep among these men&#xD;
      and their wives using a validated method for home sleep monitoring. Blood pressure,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and depression score were also assessed in the home. The&#xD;
      potential associations of sleep-disordered breathing with hypertension, impaired&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and depression were evaluated, and the possibility that these&#xD;
      relationships differed between men and women was examined.&#xD;
