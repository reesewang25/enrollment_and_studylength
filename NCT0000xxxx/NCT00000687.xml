  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of combining zidovudine (AZT) and interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2a (IFN-A2a) in a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients who have AIDS. It is&#xD;
      hoped with the present study to define the rate at which the treatment affects the tumors and&#xD;
      also to assess any toxic effects of the combination treatment over a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, the combination of IFN-A2a and AZT in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      AIDS-associated KS was evaluated and safe doses of both AZT and IFN-A2a were determined. In&#xD;
      addition, it appeared that there was a substantial reduction in KS lesions with this therapy.&#xD;
      Potential benefits of this combined therapy include resolution of KS lesions, prolonged&#xD;
      survival, a decrease in the frequency and severity of opportunistic infections, improvement&#xD;
      in CD4 cells, and a decrease in serum p24 antigens.&#xD;

      In a recent study, the combination of IFN-A2a and AZT in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      AIDS-associated KS was evaluated and safe doses of both AZT and IFN-A2a were determined. In&#xD;
      addition, it appeared that there was a substantial reduction in KS lesions with this therapy.&#xD;
      Potential benefits of this combined therapy include resolution of KS lesions, prolonged&#xD;
      survival, a decrease in the frequency and severity of opportunistic infections, improvement&#xD;
      in CD4 cells, and a decrease in serum p24 antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following evaluation studies, patients who participate in the study receive IFN-A2a and AZT.&#xD;
      IFN-A2a is administered as a single subcutaneous injection once a day. AZT is given in a&#xD;
      single capsule every 4 hours through the day for a total of six capsules. The first phase of&#xD;
      treatment continues for 8 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, during which time AZT only&#xD;
      is given. Subjects who have had an interruption in interferon during the first 8 weeks of the&#xD;
      study for a toxicity may skip the rest period. Patients experiencing a complete response will&#xD;
      be placed on maintenance therapy. Patients without progression of their KS can continue on&#xD;
      the treatment of AZT and IFN-A2a until a complete response is obtained or until study is&#xD;
      terminated, whichever comes first. Patients with complete anti-tumor response can continue on&#xD;
      a maintenance phase, in which they receive IFN-A2a as a single injection 3 times a week on&#xD;
      nonconsecutive days and a single capsule of AZT q4h 6 x /day until the study is terminated on&#xD;
      February 1, 1992. Patients are required to visit the clinic weekly for the first 12 weeks&#xD;
      (except during the week 9 rest period), every other week for the next 8 weeks, every month&#xD;
      for up to 52 weeks of the study and every 3 months thereafter. Throughout the study, frequent&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken to monitor the effectiveness and safety of the treatment.&#xD;
