  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that people with arthritis can improve their ability to cope with&#xD;
      arthritis pain with the help of patient education programs, which teach people things they&#xD;
      can do to help manage their disease. However, we do not know much about the effects of&#xD;
      arthritis patient education programs on minorities, such as urban African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will gather participants for this project through a faith-based community network. The&#xD;
      project is made up of four studies that will provide information about culturally relevant&#xD;
      ways of reaching urban African Americans with arthritis and providing patient education that&#xD;
      addresses arthritis care needs of the African American community. This project will also&#xD;
      provide information on the effectiveness of an arthritis self-help course for urban African&#xD;
      Americans. We hope to better understand the differences among cultural groups and how these&#xD;
      differences should affect the design of culturally appropriate patient education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies have shown that arthritis patient education interventions are an effective&#xD;
      addition to medical treatment in improving patients' ability to cope with pain, thereby&#xD;
      reducing perceived symptom severity, improving patients' ability to help themselves, and&#xD;
      providing them with skills and strategies for dealing with limits on daily activities. We&#xD;
      know little, however, about generalizing the effects of such programs to cultural minority&#xD;
      groups, such as urban African Americans. We know even less about the longevity of any&#xD;
      benefits of patient education or about effective reinforcement and maintenance techniques. To&#xD;
      examine these issues, we will recruit participants for this project through a faith-based&#xD;
      community network to pursue the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the impact of arthritis patient education on arthritis symptoms and pain&#xD;
           levels, functional status, self-care knowledge and behaviors, self-efficacy, emotional&#xD;
           status, and health care resource use through a randomized controlled trial (Study 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the impact of focused reinforcement of the concepts in the Arthritis Self-Help&#xD;
           Course (ASHC) over a 12-month period through a randomized controlled trial (Study 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the detailed educational dynamics of the ASHC, identify aspects of the course&#xD;
           that are less effective with or relevant to African Americans, and identify modes of&#xD;
           communication and presentation used in the course that require adaptation for an African&#xD;
           American audience (Study 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the personal and cultural belief systems underlying African Americans'&#xD;
           understanding of arthritis and their use of conventional and unconventional arthritis&#xD;
           treatments (Study 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will provide valuable information regarding culturally relevant methods of&#xD;
      reaching urban African Americans with arthritis and providing patient education that&#xD;
      addresses arthritis care needs of the African American community. This study will also&#xD;
      clarify the longevity of educational benefits and the effectiveness of alternative methods of&#xD;
      educational reinforcement in this population. The exploratory studies of individual beliefs&#xD;
      and knowledge of arthritis and its treatment, and the formal evaluation of a patient&#xD;
      education program, will provide a better understanding of the ways in which cultural groups&#xD;
      differ and how these differences should influence the design and delivery of culturally&#xD;
      appropriate patient education.&#xD;
