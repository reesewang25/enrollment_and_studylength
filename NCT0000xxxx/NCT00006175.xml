    <textblock>
      This study will measure levels of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase in gum tissue following&#xD;
      third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Cyclooxygenase is thought to contribute to pain that&#xD;
      normally follows tissue injury or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who require removal of their third molars&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Participants will receive an injection of a local anesthetic&#xD;
      (lidocaine) in the mouth and a sedative (midazolam) through an arm vein before surgery.&#xD;
      Before the tooth is removed, a small tissue sample (biopsy) will be collected from the gum&#xD;
      tissue covering one of the lower third molars to be extracted. After surgery, a second biopsy&#xD;
      will be taken at some point between just after surgery to the time when pain from the&#xD;
      extraction starts to develop. These tissue samples will be analyzed for cyclooxygenase&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will stay in the clinic for up to 4 hours after surgery while the anesthetic wears&#xD;
      off. During this time, they will complete pain questionnaires. If needed, patients may&#xD;
      receive additional medicine for pain relief at any time during the surgery or the 4-hour&#xD;
      observation period. They will also be given standard pain medication to take home at the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prostanoids are inflammatory mediators that have been implicated in all stages of acute and&#xD;
      chronic inflammation. The inhibition of prostanoid synthesis by NSAIDs forms the basis of&#xD;
      their therapeutic as well as side effects. NSAIDs directly inhibit cyclooxygenase [COX],&#xD;
      which leads to reduction of prostaglandin synthesis but also to gastric erosions, inhibition&#xD;
      of platelet aggregation and nephrotoxicity. The identification of the two isoforms of COX&#xD;
      lead to the hypothesis that COX-2 is responsible for the production of prostaglandins&#xD;
      following tissue injury, while COX-1 is involved in normal homeostasis. This hypothesis is&#xD;
      primarily based on the results of animal studies and chronic inflammatory conditions such as&#xD;
      arthritis. Recent results in the oral surgery model of acute inflammation suggest that COX-2&#xD;
      is present in the oral mucosa and may contribute to prostanoid production during acute&#xD;
      inflammation rather than require induction in response to the injury. The proposed study aims&#xD;
      to evaluate the time course of COX-1 and COX-2 in acute inflammation by evaluating levels of&#xD;
      mRNA at baseline prior to surgery, at the completion of surgery, and at one, two and three&#xD;
      hours following surgery.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be healthy volunteers between the ages 16-35 years presenting to the Clinical&#xD;
        Center for removal of their third molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The type of third molar will be characterized at the time of screening by oral exam and&#xD;
        panoramic radiograph:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Erupted tooth: Clinical crown is present in the mouth and is not covered by soft&#xD;
             tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Soft tissue impaction: Clinical crown is not present in the mouth but the adjacent&#xD;
             alveolar bone does not cover any portion of the crown in the radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Partial bony impaction: Clinical crown is not present in the mouth and the alveolar&#xD;
             bone covers some but not all of the crown in the radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Full bony impaction: Clinical crown is not present in the mouth and the alveolar bone&#xD;
             covers most or all of the crown in the radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study if the two mandibular molars are&#xD;
        classified as partial or full bony impactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of infection or inflammation [pericoronitis] at either extraction site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are taking any of the following drugs: anti-depressants, diuretics, aspirin on&#xD;
        a near daily basis, coumadin or other blood thinners; or other drugs that might influence&#xD;
        pain report or COX formation, e.g. steroids.&#xD;
