      To investigate the relation between endogenous levels of estrogen in postmenopausal women and&#xD;
      the subsequent development of coronary heart disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) lowers the risk of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease in postmenopausal women. However, it is not known whether higher endogenous levels of&#xD;
      estrogens in the postmenopausal period likewise have a protective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used an existing resource of frozen blood samples from a cohort of 7,058&#xD;
      postmenopausal women enrolled between 1985 and 1991 for a study of endogenous hormones and&#xD;
      cancer. The cohort was followed up to identify incident cases of coronary heart disease. One&#xD;
      hundred thirty cases of coronary heart disease (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or&#xD;
      death from coronary heart disease) were expected to occur by the end of follow-up. A nested&#xD;
      case-control study was conducted in which each case was matched to two women from the cohort&#xD;
      who were the same age as the case, donated blood around the same time, and were alive and&#xD;
      free of heart disease as of the date of diagnosis of the case. Frozen serum samples from&#xD;
      cases and their matched controls were analyzed for total estradiol, bioavailable estradiol&#xD;
      (the estradiol fraction not bound to sex hormone binding globulin) estrone, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conditional logistic&#xD;
      regression for matched sets were employed to determine whether estrogen levels were lower in&#xD;
      the cases than their matched controls. The association between estrogen levels and&#xD;
      cholesterol fractions was also investigated.&#xD;
