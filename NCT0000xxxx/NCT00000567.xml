      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early 1980s, there was increasing concern that the dramatic improvement in the&#xD;
      survival of immature infants had been accompanied by an increase in incidence of pulmonary&#xD;
      complications, some seriously crippling and eventually fatal. Both barotrauma and oxygen&#xD;
      toxicity had been considered in the pathogenesis of these disorders; circulatory disorders as&#xD;
      a result of failure of closure of the ductus arteriosus or fluid overload had also been&#xD;
      proposed as contributory factors. Reports of successful application of the principles of high&#xD;
      frequency ventilation (HFV) in the treatment of infants with RDS and particularly those with&#xD;
      severe interstitial emphysema raised hopes that this technique might prevent barotrauma to&#xD;
      the lungs and stimulated physicians and engineers to develop new equipment useful in&#xD;
      ventilating small infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although HFV had not been evaluated either with regard to efficacy or safety and although&#xD;
      results of fundamental studies had not provided a good understanding of how gas exchange&#xD;
      occurred during HFV, there was considerable interest in introducing this type of ventilatory&#xD;
      support in neonatal intensive care. HFV involves the use of small tidal volumes, delivered at&#xD;
      respiratory frequencies ranging from 1 to 40 Hz with the aid of, for example, a piston pump&#xD;
      or a high speed jet of gas. Compared to conventional mechanical ventilation, HFV offers&#xD;
      several potential advantages, including reduced intrapulmonary pressure swings and&#xD;
      fluctuation in alveolar pressures and the possibility of lowered levels of inspired oxygen.&#xD;
      At that time, theories suggested that HFV produced a pattern of flow that enhanced gas mixing&#xD;
      and 'homogenized' the distribution of ventilation. Experimental observations in adult animals&#xD;
      (cats, dogs and rabbits) or healthy newborn lambs had shown HFV to be effective in promoting&#xD;
      gas exchange without apparent adverse effects. Studies in prematurely delivered subhuman&#xD;
      primates, that develop RDS and subsequently bronchopulmonary dysplasia indistinguishable from&#xD;
      that of human infants, supported the notion the HFV could provide better oxygenation and&#xD;
      lower C02 levels than conventional mechanical ventilation at similar mean airway pressure.&#xD;
      The HIFI trial provided badly needed controlled data on the safety and efficacy of HFV in&#xD;
      premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I, the Planning Phase, was initiated in August 1984. Recruitment and intervention began&#xD;
      in February 1986 and ended in March 1987. Follow-up studies continued thru September 1988.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized to either standard mechanical ventilation or high frequency&#xD;
      ventilation. The principal endpoint was the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia defined&#xD;
      as: the need for supplemental oxygen on the 28th postnatal day and for more than 21 of the&#xD;
      first 28 days after birth; and abnormal chest radiographic findings that persisted until the&#xD;
      28th day of age. Other endpoints included the need for ventilatory support, the incidence of&#xD;
      crossover from one form of ventilatory support to the other, and mortality rate before the&#xD;
      28th day of postnatal age. Adverse effects considered were pulmonary air leaks, severe&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia.&#xD;
