      The purpose of this study is to learn more about stroke and obtain information that may serve&#xD;
      as the basis for future investigations. It will 1) establish a registry of patients with&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease (stroke); 2) characterize the natural history of acute stroke and&#xD;
      transient ischemic attacks (TIA) an interruption of blood flow to the brain that causes&#xD;
      stroke symptoms for a short period of time); and 3) evaluate the data to generate ideas for&#xD;
      future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with suspected acute stroke or TIA may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be recruited from patients who present with stroke at the emergency&#xD;
      department of Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will gather data collected from diagnostic and laboratory tests the patient&#xD;
      undergoes as part of standard medical care, including findings of medical and neurological&#xD;
      examinations and other tests. In addition, studies will be done for research purposes only to&#xD;
      gather data about stroke and TIA. These may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests not more than 2 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for various&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) (heart tracing) electrodes placed on the chest wall detect the&#xD;
           heartbeat and heart rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head specialized X-rays are used to obtain images&#xD;
           of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain a strong magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
           are used to produce images that provide information about the brain tissue and blood&#xD;
           vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial Doppler (TCD) sound waves are used to image the arteries of the brain and&#xD;
           neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram sound waves are used to image the heart and evaluate heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be asked to return to Suburban Hospital for follow-up testing in 1, 3, and/or 12&#xD;
      months, when some of these tests may be repeated to assess changes over time&#xD;

      Study Description: This is a natural history/disease pathogenesis protocol for evaluation of&#xD;
      patients with or at risk of acute stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or other&#xD;
      disturbances of cerebrovascular circulation. The purpose of this protocol is to generate&#xD;
      natural history data to serve as the basis for future hypothesis-driven protocols as well as&#xD;
      to contribute to the clinical and physiological understanding of cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
      through the description of disease manifestation and the relationship among clinical,&#xD;
      hematologic, and radiologic variables, as well as identifying potential subjects for future&#xD;
      studies on stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish a registry of subjects with cerebrovascular disease including clinical,&#xD;
           laboratory, and radiological variables associated with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke,&#xD;
           TIA, and other disturbances of cerebrovascular circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the natural history of acute stroke, TIA, and other disturbances of&#xD;
           cerebrovascular circulation on these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the relationship among these variables by exploratory analyses and to&#xD;
           generate hypotheses for future testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify potential subjects for research studies on stroke and other cerebrovascular&#xD;
           diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: A primary purpose of this observational protocol is to discover and study new&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers that are i) relevant to the acute presentation and severity, ii)&#xD;
      predictive of clinical outcome, and iii) are useful for stratifying the biological response&#xD;
      as reflected in blood-biomarker and gene expression studies. As such, the primary outcome is&#xD;
      the results from the imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence and type of abnormalities seen on neuroimaging as a function of time from acute&#xD;
      insult such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging positive for acute ischemic cerebral vascular syndrome ( AICS positive )[1]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of a lesion on diffusion, perfusion, and mismatch between the two&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of a vascular occlusion on MR angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of a thrombus or hemorrhage on T2* GRE imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood-brain barrier disruption as evidence by HARM [2]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of these markers with time and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke severity as measured by NIHSS as a function of time since index event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcome measured using modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene expression profiles and biomarker levels obtained from blood samples.&#xD;
