  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical, epidemiologic, genetic, and laboratory study of individuals and families&#xD;
      at high risk of cancer and selected tumors to investigate the genetic susceptibility and&#xD;
      environmental exposures which may alter cancer risk. Families with multiple members who have&#xD;
      an unusual pattern or number of cancers or tumors are evaluated clinically. This evaluation&#xD;
      is specific for the type of cancer or tumor predominant in the family in order to determine&#xD;
      the affection status of each individual for genetic epidemiologic studies. Genetic and&#xD;
      environmental risk factor information specific for the tumor type is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with, or at high risk of, cancer because of their personal, familial, or&#xD;
      environmental histories are identified by healthcare worker referral or by personal inquiry.&#xD;
      Relevant etiologic risk factor information is documented through review of pathology&#xD;
      specimens and medical, vital, and genealogical records. Selected individuals and family&#xD;
      members are asked to complete questionnaires and to undergo clinical evaluations specific for&#xD;
      the tumor of interest. They are also asked to donate biologic specimens to be used in the&#xD;
      search for cancer etiology and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. No therapy beyond counseling and&#xD;
      education for cancer prevention, risk reduction, and early detection will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing for tumor susceptibility gene(s) mutations and risk notification will be&#xD;
      offered to study participants for whom a specific mutation predictive of disease has been&#xD;
      identified in his/her family. This testing will only be offered when reasonable individual&#xD;
      cancer risk estimates can be delivered, and only to those participants who choose to know&#xD;
      their individual genetic status after appropriate education and counseling. The testing will&#xD;
      be conducted exclusively in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-licensed&#xD;
      laboratories. Genetic testing and risk notification are entirely optional and do not affect&#xD;
      participation in other aspects of the protocol. A separate consent procedure and consent form&#xD;
      will be used for genetic testing and risk notification related to these specific genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, study participants are monitored prospectively for the development of outcomes&#xD;
      of interest, typically by means of periodic mail or telephone contact. In selected instances,&#xD;
      subjects may return to the Clinical Center periodically for study-specific follow-up&#xD;
      examinations. Although we do not offer specific anti-cancer therapy as part of this protocol,&#xD;
      we provide assistance to insure that study participants who require treatment for&#xD;
      tumor-related problems that develop during the course of the study are referred to&#xD;
      appropriate healthcare providers. We remain available to study participants and their&#xD;
      healthcare providers for advice and consultation related to the management of familial&#xD;
      cancer/tumor predisposition.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons may be prone to develop cancer for a variety of reasons including: inherited&#xD;
      predisposition benign, premalignant, or malignant conditions; environmental exposures shared&#xD;
      by family members; previous tumors, immune deficiency, or preneoplastic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations of individuals and families at high risk of cancer often lead to etiologic&#xD;
      clues that may be important in the sporadic counterparts of these cancers in the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of etiologically important genetic factors could inform chemoprevention&#xD;
      trials, screening programs, and treatment of the studied cancer types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and define the clinical spectrum and natural history of disease in syndromes&#xD;
      predisposing to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate potential precursor states of disease in families at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantify risks of tumors in family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To map, clone, and determine function of tumor susceptibility genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify genetic determinants, environmental factors, and gene-environment interactions&#xD;
      conferring cancer risk in individuals and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in tumor formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To educate and counsel study participants about their tumor risk including prevention&#xD;
      recommendations and early detection activities when known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop educational materials for medical professionals and high-risk family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons of any age will be considered for inclusion in the study because of either,&#xD;
&#xD;
      A family or personal medical history of neoplasia of an unusual type, pattern, or number; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to neoplasia, either genetic and/or congenital&#xD;
      factors, environmental exposure, or unusual demographic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of familial tumors that we are currently actively accruing include Cancers: bladder,&#xD;
      bone, brain, chordoma, lung, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study. Individuals and families are studied long-term, using a cohort&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design and clinical evaluation vary by the specific type of familial neoplasm being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall approach to eligible study participants includes defining affection status,&#xD;
      characterization of disease, localization of genetic loci, identification of genes,&#xD;
      evaluation of phenotype/genotype correlations, estimation of risk of the disease associated&#xD;
      with carrier status and identification of other risk factors that modify penetrance (genetic,&#xD;
      environmental, host factors).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        On referral, persons of any age will be considered for the inclusion in the study because&#xD;
        of either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A family or personal history of neoplasia of an unusual type, pattern, or number; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
        known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to neoplasia, either genetic and/or congenital&#xD;
        factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies or Mendelian traits&#xD;
        associated with tumors), environmental exposure (medications, occupation, radiation, diet,&#xD;
        infectious agents, etc.), or unusual demographic features (very young age of onset,&#xD;
        multiple tumors, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews,&#xD;
        and review of pathology slides and medical records. For familial neoplasms, two or more&#xD;
        living affected cases among family members are required. The types of familial tumors that&#xD;
        we are currently actively accruing include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Familial Cancers: bladder, brain, chordoma, lung, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome&#xD;
        (NBCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Familial Benign Neoplasms: meningiomas, neurofibromatosis 2 (bilateral acoustic&#xD;
        neurofibromatosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        The types of familial tumors under active accrual and study are predominantly&#xD;
        investigator-and hypothesis-driven. This approach permits GEB investigators to remain alert&#xD;
        to the opportunities afforded by clusters of rare tumors in families and individuals, and&#xD;
        to be more responsive to the dynamic research priorities in cancer genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Referred individuals and families for whom reported diagnoses cannot be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible for familial melanoma, lymphoproliferative, breast-ovarian cancer, or testicular&#xD;
        cancer protocols.&#xD;
