      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill&#xD;
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who have&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder that is associated with immunosuppression therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of rituximab in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      disorders while under pharmacologic immune suppression for control of either allograft&#xD;
      rejection or autoimmune disease. II. Evaluate the safety and direct toxicity of rituximab in&#xD;
      this patient population, including the potential for opportunistic infections. III. Evaluate&#xD;
      the secondary consequences of rituximab therapy in this population, including changes in the&#xD;
      requirement for immunosuppressive drugs, effects on graft rejection, graft survival, and&#xD;
      severity of autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV over several hours. Treatment repeats every week for 4&#xD;
      courses. Patients are followed every month for 6 months, and then every 3 months until&#xD;
      relapse or 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.&#xD;
