      The purpose of this double-masked, pilot trial is to determine whether 20 percent thalidomide&#xD;
      ointment is safe and effective for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      (CDLE) when used under an occlusive dressing. Seventeen patients with two similar lesions&#xD;
      will have lesions randomized to receive either intervention or placebo therapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Age, 18 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have lesions that fulfill clinical and histologic criteria for active CDLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lesions must be of at least 3 months duration and must not have been treated with topical&#xD;
        steroids or retinoids for at least 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must have at least two similar lesions that can accommodate a 2X3 inch dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must be willing to have two 4 mm biopsies prior to onset of therapy and four 4 mm&#xD;
        biopsies at the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the absence of systemic involvement, the CDLE lesions must not have responded to at&#xD;
        least 3 months of therapy with topical steroids, sunscreens with or without antimalarials&#xD;
        such as hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If CDLE is present in association with systemic involvement, the lesions must not have&#xD;
        responded to 3 months of stable conventional systemic therapy and/or topical steroids and&#xD;
        sunscreens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If female, the patient must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If female, must be postmenopausal surgically sterile, sexually inactive, or practicing&#xD;
        successful contraception with two methods of birth control simultaneously for at least one&#xD;
        month prior to starting on thalidomide and continue use for another month after the last&#xD;
        application of thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If male, the patient must be surgically sterilized, sexually inactive, or use a condom&#xD;
        during the study and continue regular use until one month after the last application of&#xD;
        thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have normal cognitive abilities to be able to understand the experimental&#xD;
        nature of the therapy, to be able to follow instructions regarding application of&#xD;
        medication and correct use of contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have renal disease (serum creatinine greater than 2 times the upper limit&#xD;
        of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have hepatic dysfunction (liver function tests greater than 2 times the&#xD;
        upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have unstable systemic lupus erythematosus such that systemic therapy&#xD;
        cannot be maintained at steady doses for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not use topical steroids for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not be currently receiving systemic thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not be hypersensitive to thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have presence of polyneuropathy (objective sensory loss or motor weakness&#xD;
        or reflex loss) with the exception of focal nerve entrapment syndromes (such as carpal&#xD;
        tunnel syndrome), or receiving drugs with known or suspected neuropathic side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have any other condition or therapy which in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigators may pose a risk to the patient or confound the results of the study.&#xD;
