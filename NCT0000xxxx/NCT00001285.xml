  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many years researchers have been trying to better understand the regulation of sleep and&#xD;
      activity by studying circadian (daily) rhythms of human beings. It appears that the hormones&#xD;
      estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone play a role in the regulation of circadian rhythm in&#xD;
      animals. Researchers believe these hormones may also play a similar role in the regulation of&#xD;
      human circadian rhythms. Little research has been conducted on how these hormones affect&#xD;
      human circadian rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to learn more about how specific hormones influence men and women's&#xD;
      daily rhythms. This study will use women from another research study being conducted at the&#xD;
      NIMH called, &quot;The central nervous system effects of pharmacologically induced&#xD;
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without estrogen and progesterone&quot;. Male subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited from another NIMH study called, &quot;The central nervous system effects of&#xD;
      pharmacologically induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without testosterone&#xD;
      replacement&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test the possibility that gonadal steroids (estrogen, progesterone, and&#xD;
      testosterone) change circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle in humans, participants will&#xD;
      undergo chronobiologic evaluations. The chronobiologic evaluations will look at sleep and&#xD;
      rest periods, activity as measured by a wrist monitor, and 24 hour inpatient&#xD;
      electroencephalograph (EEG), rectal temperature, and melatonin monitoring.&#xD;

      It is hypothesized that gonadal steroids modulate circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle&#xD;
      in humans, as they do in animals. This hypothesis will be tested by performing chronobiologic&#xD;
      evaluations on women enrolled in protocol 92-M-0174 (&quot;The central nervous system effects of&#xD;
      pharmacologically induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone&quot;) and on men enrolled in protocol 94-M-0037 (The central nervous system effects&#xD;
      of pharmacologically induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without testosterone&#xD;
      replacement&quot;). Based on the animal literature, we hypothesize that melatonin and sleep onset&#xD;
      will be phase-advanced in women on estrogen, compared with those on progesterone or in a&#xD;
      hypogonadal state. We also hypothesize that the amplitude of the activity cycle will be&#xD;
      decreased in the progesterone, as compared with the estrogen, condition. Based on findings in&#xD;
      amenorrheic women and in those on oral contraceptives, we hypothesize that the amplitude of&#xD;
      melatonin secretion will be increased in the hypogonadal state, compared with the other two&#xD;
      conditions. Finally, based on literature cited below, we hypothesize that mean prolactin&#xD;
      levels will be higher in the testosterone plus Lupron condition and in the estrogen plus&#xD;
      Lupron condition than in the other hormonal conditions.&#xD;
