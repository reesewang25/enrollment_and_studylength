  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized in its&#xD;
      classical form by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, recurrent infection due to&#xD;
      abnormal neutrophil and natural killer cell function, and eventual progression to a&#xD;
      lymphohistiocytic infiltration known as the accelerated phase . Death often occurs within the&#xD;
      first decade as a result of infection or the development of the accelerated phase; bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation is curative except for the late occurrence of neurological&#xD;
      deterioration. The basic defect is unknown, although it probably involves abnormal fusion or&#xD;
      trafficking of intracellular vesicles. Patients with classical CHS have their disease due to&#xD;
      mutations in the LYST gene, but mildly affected individuals have been reported whose genetic&#xD;
      defect has not been defined. It is likely that these variants of CHS have abnormalities in&#xD;
      proteins involved in the pathways responsible for vesicle fusion. Since the full clinical&#xD;
      spectrum of CHS and its variants has not been characterized, and the underlying defects&#xD;
      remain enigmatic, we plan to evaluate this group of patients clinically, biochemically, and&#xD;
      molecularly, and perform cell biological studies on their fibroblasts, melanocytes, and&#xD;
      transformed lymphoblasts. Routine admissions will be 5 days and may occur every two years, or&#xD;
      required by changes in clinical symptomatology.&#xD;

      Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized in its&#xD;
      classical form by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, recurrent infection due to&#xD;
      abnormal neutrophil and natural killer cell function, and often progression to a&#xD;
      lymphohistiocytic infiltration known as the accelerated phase . Death generally occurs within&#xD;
      the first decade as a result of infection or the development of the accelerated phase; bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation is curative except for the late occurrence of neurological&#xD;
      deterioration. However, our research has identified mildly affected individuals who present&#xD;
      primarily with a neurological phenotype characterized by central and peripheral nervous&#xD;
      system involvement. In addition, classical cases treated with bone marrow transplant (BMT)&#xD;
      and surviving into adulthood usually develop neurological symptoms adding relevance to the&#xD;
      study of pathophysiology of this disease outside of the hematological and immune systems. The&#xD;
      only gene known to be associated with CHS is LYST; however, there are some patients with CHS&#xD;
      in whom mutations have not been found, suggesting locus heterogeneity. A genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      correlation had begun to emerge, but recent reports noted exceptions to this correlation. The&#xD;
      basic defect is unknown, although it probably involves abnormal fusion or trafficking of&#xD;
      intracellular vesicles. With regards to neurologic involvement, LYST likely also plays a role&#xD;
      in neuronal axonal transport and neurotransmitter pools. We plan to evaluate individuals with&#xD;
      CHS clinically, biochemically, and molecularly, and perform cell biological studies on their&#xD;
      fibroblasts, melanocytes, and transformed lymphoblasts. Routine admissions may be 3-5 days&#xD;
      and may occur every one to two years, or as required by changes in clinical symptomatology.&#xD;

        Patients entering this study will have clinical features suggestive of CHS. Objective&#xD;
        evidence of a platelet storage pool deficiency (e.g., an abnormal secondary aggregation&#xD;
        response or absent platelet dense bodies) or of a lysosomal fusion abnormality (e.g., giant&#xD;
        cytoplasmic granules in leucocytes) will not be required.@@@&#xD;

        Patients will be between the age of 1 month and 70 years. All patients entering this study&#xD;
        will have some degree of oculocutaneous albinism plus either a bleeding diathesis or a&#xD;
        history of excessive infections in childhood. Objective evidence of a platelet storage pool&#xD;
        deficiency (e.g., an abnormal secondary aggregation response or absent platelet dense&#xD;
