  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study which addresses the feasibility and toxicity of adding taxol to the&#xD;
      two drug combination which now comprises the standard of care in newly diagnosed advanced&#xD;
      stage ovarian cancer, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. These drugs will be given in a dose&#xD;
      intensive fashion with the colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF. Newly diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer will be treated with this regimen to determine the optimal dose of this&#xD;
      combination. The pharmacokinetics of taxol and cisplatin DNA-adducts will be studied as well.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All patients must have biopsy proven ovarian cancer as determined by evaluation in the&#xD;
        Laboratory of Pathology, NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Germ cell and borderline histologies are specifically excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have FIGO stage III and IV disease, or FIGO Stage IIC disease with poorly&#xD;
        differentiated histology, and will undergo attempted surgical debulking prior to the&#xD;
        initiation of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy will make a patient ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance status: less than or equal to ECOG 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have the following end organ function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No brain involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias requiring&#xD;
&#xD;
        therapy, right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock, and left bundle branch&#xD;
        block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal function: creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 cc/min; patients with&#xD;
        ureteral obstruction must have this corrected prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hepatic function: normal coagulation parameters, serum transaminases within 3 times upper&#xD;
        limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neurologic function: no preexisting dysfunction greater than grade 1 (exclusive of mild&#xD;
        vibratory delay).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No recent history of active GI bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematologic parameters prior to starting cycle 1 of therapy: total granulocyte count&#xD;
        greater than 2000 and platelet count greater than 100,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have had prior history of invasive malignancy with the exception of&#xD;
        nonmelanoma skin cancer curatively treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to give written informed consent and express a willingness to meet&#xD;
        all of the expected requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to begin therapy within 8 weeks of staging laparotomy and should have&#xD;
        a central venous catheter placed for infusion of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must be registered by calling the Orkand Corporation at 402-1732 between the&#xD;
        hours of 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM; eligibility criteria will be queried.&#xD;
