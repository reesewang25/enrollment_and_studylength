  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the third leading cause of preventable admissions to the hospital in the United&#xD;
      States. Deaths and diseases associated with asthma increase every year. Asthma is a disorder&#xD;
      of airway inflammation. There are several factors thought to play a role in the process of&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers are particularly interested in studying a factors known as TNF&#xD;
      (tumor necrosis factor) and the sites where this factor attaches called receptors. Another&#xD;
      factor associated with receptor processing is called aminopeptidase-like protein. It may be&#xD;
      involved in the relationship between TNF, it's receptors, and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to understand the relationship between these factors, researchers plan to simulate&#xD;
      an allergic reaction in the lungs and airways of patients participating in the study. By&#xD;
      doing this they can collect and study the factors causing airway inflammation. Samples&#xD;
      collected from patients with asthma will be compared to samples from volunteers without&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and volunteers participating in this study will not directly benefit from this&#xD;
      research. However, the study may help researchers understand the causes and processes&#xD;
      involved in asthma. In addition, the study may lead to the development of new treatments for&#xD;
      asthma and airway inflammation.&#xD;

      The goal of this exploratory study is to assess the role of a novel aminopeptidase-like&#xD;
      protein during the induction of airway inflammation in asthma. This aminopeptidase-like&#xD;
      protein may be involved in processing of the type I TNF receptor to a soluble form. We&#xD;
      propose to study the role of this aminopeptidase-like protein in the setting of late phase&#xD;
      asthmatic airway inflammatory responses following segmental allergen challenge in mild&#xD;
      allergic asthmatics.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Must be between 18 and 65 years of age, male or female, and must be at least 5 feet in&#xD;
        height.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of asthma requires a history of intermittent, reversible expiratory flow&#xD;
        limitation. Patients will have mild-to-moderately severe asthma as defined by a baseline&#xD;
        forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV(1)) greater than 70% of predicted (at least 6&#xD;
        hours after bronchodilator use) and therapy limited to inhaled beta-agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive skin prick-puncture test to one or more common aeroallergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A positive inhaled methacholine challenge as defined by a decrease in FEV(1) of at least&#xD;
        20% (PC(20)) in response to inhalation of less than 25 mg/ml of methacholine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A decrease in FEV(1) of at least 20% in response to inhalation of up to 10,000&#xD;
        bioequivalency allergy units (BAU) or allergy units (AU) per ml of a selected common&#xD;
        aeroallergen (house dust mite, cat hair or grasses) or up to 150 Antigen E units per ml of&#xD;
        short ragweed. Asthmatic patients must also demonstrate a late asthmatic response (defined&#xD;
        as a 20% fall from the baseline established following completion of the early asthmatic&#xD;
        response).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal complete blood count, PT, PTT, and serum electrolytes, mineral and hepatic panels&#xD;
        (less than 30 ml of blood will be drawn), normal EKG and chest radiograph without acute&#xD;
