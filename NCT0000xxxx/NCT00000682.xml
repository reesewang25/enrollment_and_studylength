  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of AZT versus ddC in terms of survival, antiviral effects,&#xD;
      neurological status, and health status in patients post Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)&#xD;
      who received long-term AZT therapy in ACTG protocol 002 While treatment with AZT has been&#xD;
      found to be effective in prolonging survival and reducing the numbers of opportunistic&#xD;
      infections in patients with AIDS, during the second year of administration of AZT an&#xD;
      acceleration in mortality has been observed. The reasons for this are not known at this time.&#xD;
      The study of what may be an AZT-resistant strain of HIV may benefit patients who have been&#xD;
      and are still receiving AZT or another drug used in treating HIV ddC. It is hoped that the&#xD;
      comparison of the effectiveness of AZT and ddC will benefit in the treatment of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      While treatment with AZT has been found to be effective in prolonging survival and reducing&#xD;
      the numbers of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS, during the second year of&#xD;
      administration of AZT an acceleration in mortality has been observed. The reasons for this&#xD;
      are not known at this time. The study of what may be an AZT-resistant strain of HIV may&#xD;
      benefit patients who have been and are still receiving AZT or another drug used in treating&#xD;
      HIV ddC. It is hoped that the comparison of the effectiveness of AZT and ddC will benefit in&#xD;
      the treatment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following tests to evaluate their health, patients are chosen at random to receive either AZT&#xD;
      or ddC. AZT is given by mouth at the patients' current dose. ddC is given by mouth every 8&#xD;
      hours. Treatment continues for up to 12 months. Patients are required to visit the clinic&#xD;
      every 2 weeks up to week 12 and then once a month. Blood samples are taken to monitor the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;

        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) with aerosolized pentamidine&#xD;
             of 300 mg every 4 weeks through the Respirgard II nebulizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maintenance treatment with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, amphotericin, fluconazole,&#xD;
             ketoconazole, acyclovir, or inhaled pentamidine for subjects who have recovered from&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients must be positive for HIV by ELISA test and must have been receiving zidovudine&#xD;
        (AZT) therapy for at least 9 months and have received AZT within 90 days prior to entry&#xD;
        into the study.&#xD;
