      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isocyanates account for the highest number of reported cases of occupational asthma in the&#xD;
      United States and developed countries. Prevention, however is limited by inadequate knowledge&#xD;
      of isocyanate routes of exposure, exposure patterns, mechanisms of sensitization and other&#xD;
      causal factors. The Survey of Painters and Repairers of Auto Bodies by Yale (SPRAY), a&#xD;
      five-year cross-sectional epidemiologic survey of painters and repairers of autobodies at&#xD;
      Yale was therefore initiated to address these questions. At the outset of Spray, it was not&#xD;
      known how frequent skin contact among the painters might be. Moreover, there is new and&#xD;
      exciting data from animal studies demonstrating that dermal rather than respiratory contact&#xD;
      may be crucial to immune sensitization leading to asthma. Little is known, so far, about&#xD;
      dermal exposure in autobody shops and its modifiers, especially the effectiveness of personal&#xD;
      protective equipment (PPE) in preventing workers from skin contamination by isocyanates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was ancillary to the SPRAY study and was integrated into it. The overall design was&#xD;
      a cross-sectional investigation of 20 shops with 120 workers. This would allow a better&#xD;
      understanding of the complex basis for asthma risk in these workers, and better&#xD;
      recommendations to autobody shops and workers on protective measures for isocyanate dermal&#xD;
      exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims included: 1) Qualitatively and quantitatively assessing surface and skin&#xD;
      contamination of HDI; 2) Identifying modifiers that affected surface and skin contamination,&#xD;
      and specifically evaluating the effectiveness of personal protective equipment in protecting&#xD;
      the skin from isocyanate contamination; 3) Exploring the relationships of dermal exposure&#xD;
      with airborne exposure, biomarkers of systemic absorption and skin sensitization, and&#xD;
      asthma-developing risk.&#xD;
