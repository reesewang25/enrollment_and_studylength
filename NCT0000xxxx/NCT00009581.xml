  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide is important in regulating blood vessel dilation, and consequently, blood flow.&#xD;
      This gas is continuously produced by cells that line the blood vessels. It is also&#xD;
      transported from the lungs by hemoglobin in red blood cells. This study will examine how this&#xD;
      gas regulates blood vessels and blood flow in people with sickle cell anemia. It will also&#xD;
      look at a possible benefit of using certain genetic information to compare the white blood&#xD;
      cells of people with sickle cell anemia to those without the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sickle cell anemia and healthy normal volunteers 18 to 65 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, cardiovascular&#xD;
      physical examination, electrocardiogram and routine blood tests. Participation of volunteers&#xD;
      without sickle cell anemia will be limited to a single blood draw for genetic study. Sickle&#xD;
      cell disease patients will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will lie in a reclining chair during the study. After administration of a local&#xD;
      anesthetic, small tubes will be inserted through a needle into the artery and vein of the&#xD;
      patient's forearm. These are used to measure blood pressure and draw blood samples during the&#xD;
      study. Forearm blood flow will be measured using pressure cuffs placed on the wrist and upper&#xD;
      arm, and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) placed around the forearm. When the cuffs are&#xD;
      inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain gauge, and the flow measurement is&#xD;
      recorded. A small lamp will be positioned over the hand. Light reflected back from the hand&#xD;
      provides information about nitric oxide and hemoglobin in the blood of the skin. A squeezing&#xD;
      device called a dynamometer will be used to measure handgrip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline blood flow, nitric oxide, hemoglobin, and handgrip will be measured after an&#xD;
      infusion of glucose (sugar) and water. These measurements will be repeated at various times&#xD;
      before, during and after administration of small doses of the following drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sodium nitroprusside - causes blood vessels to dilate and increases blood flow to the&#xD;
           heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acetylcholine - causes blood vessels to dilate and slows heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LNMMA - decreases blood flow by blocking the production of nitric oxide&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 20- to 30-minute rest period between injections of the different drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the above tests are completed, the patient will breathe a mixture of room air and nitric&#xD;
      oxide for 1 hour through a facemask placed over the face, after which forearm blood flow and&#xD;
      light reflected from the hand will be measured. Then the patient will do the handgrip&#xD;
      exercise for 5 minutes, after which blood flow and hand lamp measurements will be taken.&#xD;
      After a 20-minute rest period (with continued breathing of room air/nitric oxide), L-NMMA&#xD;
      will be infused again. The handgrip exercise, blood flow and hand lamp measurements will be&#xD;
      repeated. The face mask will then be removed, and the tubes will be removed 20 minutes later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at various times during the 5- to 6-hour study through the&#xD;
      tubes in the arm. Some of the blood will be used to look at genes that make proteins involved&#xD;
      in cell-to-cell communication, inflammation, and in making red and white blood cells stick to&#xD;
      the lining of blood vessels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease&#xD;
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis and acute chest&#xD;
      syndrome are common complications of sickle cell anemia. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been&#xD;
      proposed as a possible therapy for the acute chest syndrome. Anecdotally, NO has been&#xD;
      described to rapidly improve the hypoxemia and the clinical course of the acute chest&#xD;
      syndrome. Furthermore, a number of recent studies have suggested that NO may have a favorable&#xD;
      impact on sickle red cells at the molecular level and could improve the abnormal&#xD;
      microvascular perfusion that is characteristic of sickle cell anemia. This clinical trial is&#xD;
      designed to test the hypotheses that 1) individuals with sickle cell anemia have endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction with reduced local synthesis and release of NO, that may reduce regional&#xD;
      perfusion at rest and impair the vasodilator response to stress, and 2) during NO inhalation,&#xD;
      delivery of NO bound to hemoglobin will be enhanced and will improve these abnormalities in&#xD;
      regional vascular perfusion. Studies will be performed on untreated sickle cell anemia&#xD;
      patients and on patients managed with chronic hydroxyurea therapy. Demonstration of improved&#xD;
      regional perfusion with NO therapy could have significant implications for patient management&#xD;
      during acute pain crisis and the acute chest syndrome.&#xD;
