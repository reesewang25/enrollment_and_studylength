  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the nervous system. The exact cause of MS is unknown,&#xD;
      but it is believed to be an autoimmune condition. Autoimmune conditions are diseases that&#xD;
      cause the body's immune system and natural defenses to attack healthy cells. In the case of&#xD;
      MS, the immune system begins attacking myelin, the cells that make up the sheath covering&#xD;
      nerves. Without myelin nerves are unable to transmit signals effectively and symptoms occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are interested in testing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of a new&#xD;
      therapy (CGP77116) for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). CGP77116 is a small protein similar to the&#xD;
      protein in myelin. CGP77116 is designed to modify the immune reaction that destroys normal&#xD;
      myelin. CGP77116 is an experimental therapy meaning it has not been approved by the U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration. However, in preliminary studies on animal it has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective at modifying the autoimmune reaction associated with the development of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effect of CGP77116 on disease activity&#xD;
      in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      immunological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is broken into three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) BASELINE: in the first part of the study patients will undergo 6 MRIs over a 5 month&#xD;
      period. During this time, patients will be evaluated based on the presence of MS lesions seen&#xD;
      on MRI. Patients whose MS lesions are highly active will be entered into the second part of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) TREATMENT: in the second part of the study, patients with active MS lesions will begin&#xD;
      receiving CGP77116. The drug will be given by injection once a week for one month and then&#xD;
      once a month for 8 additional months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III) FOLLOW-UP: in the third and final part of the study, patients will undergo an MRI every&#xD;
      2 months for 6 months and then every 3 months for 6 additional months. The results of the&#xD;
      MRIs will be used to measure the effectiveness of CGP77116.&#xD;

      This trial will evaluate safety, tolerability and effect on cranial magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and immune response of CGP 77116 in patients with the demyelinating autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). The purpose of the trial is to assess whether CGP 77116&#xD;
      modifies inflammatory disease activity as measured by MRI and immunological techniques, and&#xD;
      to facilitate dose selection for future pivotal trials in progressive and relapsing-remitting&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGP 77116 is an altered peptide ligand (APL) designed around an immunodominant epitope of&#xD;
      human myelin basic protein (MBP) corresponding to amino acids 83-99, for the treatment of&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS). Substitution of a key T cell receptor contact residue with alanine&#xD;
      results in a non-stimulatory peptide analogue. Recent evidence suggests that a T&#xD;
      cell-mediated immune response against immunodominant myelin protein peptides such as MBP&#xD;
      (83-99) is involved in MS pathogenesis (1). MS results when the immune system is unable to&#xD;
      keep autoreactive T cells from entering the central nervous system where they initiate&#xD;
      demyelination of myelin sheaths. By targeting MBP autoreactive T cells, CGP 77116 may&#xD;
      downregulate the MBP-specific immune response and lead to amelioration of MS.&#xD;
