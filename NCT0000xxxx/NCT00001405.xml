      The research goal of this study is to obtain CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from&#xD;
      peripheral blood and/or bone marrow, and Mononuclear Cells (lymphocytes and monocytes), and&#xD;
      granulocytes (grans) from peripheral blood that will be used in the laboratory and/or in the&#xD;
      clinic to develop new cell therapies for patients with inherited or acquired disorders of&#xD;
      immunity or blood cells. Development of novel cellular therapies requires access to HSC,&#xD;
      Mononuclear Cells and/or granulocytes as the essential starting materials for the&#xD;
      pre-clinical laboratory development of gene therapies and other engineered cell products. HSC&#xD;
      or blood cells from healthy adult volunteers serve both as necessary experimental controls&#xD;
      and also as surrogates for patient cells for clinical scale-up development. HSC or blood&#xD;
      cells from patients serve both as the necessary experimental substrate for novel gene therapy&#xD;
      and cellular engineering development for specific disorders and as pre-clinical scale up of&#xD;
      cellular therapies. Collection of cells from adult patients collected in the NIH Department&#xD;
      of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) under conditions conforming to accepted blood banking clinical&#xD;
      practice may also be used directly in or cryopreserved for future use in other NIH protocols&#xD;
      that have all required regulatory approvals allowing such use. In summary, the research goal&#xD;
      of this protocol is the collection of HSC or blood cells that may be used for both laboratory&#xD;
      research and/or for clinical treatment in other approved protocols....&#xD;

      The research goal of this study is to obtain CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from&#xD;
      peripheral blood and/or bone marrow, and Mononuclear Cells (lymphocytes and monocytes), and&#xD;

      cells from patients serve both as the necessary experimental substrate for novel gene therapy&#xD;
      and cellular engineering development for specific disorders and as pre-clinical scale up of&#xD;
      cellular therapies. Collection of cells from adult patients collected in the NIH Department&#xD;
      of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) under conditions conforming to accepted blood banking clinical&#xD;
      practice may also be used directly in or cryopreserved for future use in other NIH protocols&#xD;
      that have all required regulatory approvals allowing such use. In summary, the research goal&#xD;
      of this protocol is -the collection of HSC or blood cells that may be used for both&#xD;
      laboratory research and/or for clinical treatment in other approved protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants include: 1. Adult patients with any primary immune deficiency (PID) or other&#xD;
      blood disorder where collection is both for clinical use in another approved treatment&#xD;
      protocol to benefit the patient and for laboratory research; 2. Adult patients with any&#xD;
      primary immune deficiency (PID) or blood disorder where collection is for laboratory research&#xD;
      use only. 3. Healthy adult volunteers where the collection is for laboratory research use&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of subjects will have HSC collected from peripheral blood by apheresis. Daily&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor/filgrastim) for 5 to&#xD;
      6 days is a standard of care method used to mobilize HSC to the peripheral blood prior to&#xD;
      apheresis, and will be used for most subjects. Plerixafor (Mozobil) is approved as standard&#xD;
      of care for use in combination with G-CSF to mobilize HSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some adult patients will have a clinical scale aspiration collection of bone marrow to obtain&#xD;
      HSC for clinical use in another approved treatment protocol. Some adult participants may have&#xD;
      a small sample needle aspiration collection of bone marrow obtained for laboratory research&#xD;
      purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mononuclear cells and/or Granulocytes (gran) will be collected from peripheral blood by&#xD;
      apheresis following no stimulation, using G-CSF alone, or a using a combined single dose of&#xD;
      G-CSF (480mcg) and Dexamethasone (8mg) prior to collection as is the standard of care&#xD;
      pre-treatment used in the NIH DTM for collection of granulocyte transfusions from healthy&#xD;
      donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted, HSC, mononuclear cells, and gran collection from patients with PID or other blood&#xD;
      disorders may be used for laboratory research or may be designated for future clinical&#xD;
      treatment of the patient under separate treatment protocol. HSC, mononuclear cells, and gran&#xD;
      collection from healthy volunteers will be designated entirely for laboratory research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSC will be used for the following clinical purposes, where clinical treatments would occur&#xD;
      under separate IRB approved protocols: 1. Autologous HSC from patients may be genetically&#xD;
      modified and infused into the patient for treatment of an infection or the underlying disease&#xD;
      (Gene therapy); 2. Autologous HSC from patients may serve as back up (rescue product) for&#xD;
      patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplantation or haploidential related or&#xD;
      unrelated donor transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mononuclear Cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) and granulocytes will be used for the following&#xD;
      clinical purposes, 1. Autologous lymphocytes may be genetically modified and infused into the&#xD;
      patient for treatment of an infection or the underlying disease (Gene therapy); 2. Autologous&#xD;
      lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes (neutrophils) may be transfected with mRNAs to&#xD;
      transiently express a therapeutic protein for treatment of an infection or the underlying&#xD;
      disease (Gene therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSC, lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes will be used for laboratory research studies&#xD;
      that include: Delineating the pathophysiology of inherited immune deficiencies; Delineating&#xD;
      the physiology of and improving engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells; Determining how&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells may be maintained in ex vivo culture without losing pluripotent&#xD;
      potential; Delineating the molecular mechanisms responsible for lineage specific&#xD;
      differentiation; Developing efficient methods for gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells&#xD;
      for corrective gene therapy; Developing methods for restoration of function in defective&#xD;
      peripheral blood monocytes and/or granulocytes; Further characterization of peripheral blood&#xD;
      monocytes and/or granulocytes from patients with PID.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable (systolic or diastolic blood pressure fall&#xD;
             of 20 mm Hg from the stable patient s baseline measurement) or requiring mechanical&#xD;

             pregnancy test are excluded.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. XSCID patients do not make antibodies and false positives may occur because they&#xD;
                  receive periodic infusions of pooled donations of IVIG. We have observed positive&#xD;
                  anti-HBc testing in these patients. If this occurs, more specific DNA or antigen&#xD;

                  phenotype may have false positive antibody tests and if this occurs more specific&#xD;
                  DNA or antigen testing will be done and must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Autologous HSC Transplant patients - may be positive for Hepatitis B and C if the&#xD;
                  investigator deems it necessary to be collected and used as a safety back-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active bacterial, fungal or viral infection as evidenced by history, physical exam&#xD;

          2. Females who are pregnant or lactating as determined by history and/or pregnancy test&#xD;
             are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be negative by routine blood donor eligibility testing criteria, including tests&#xD;
             for syphilis (RPR) and TTV Recipient Transplant Panel (list is modified periodically,&#xD;
             but may include hepatitis B and C, HIV and HTLV, T. cruzi) This does not apply to&#xD;
             leukaphersis patients, as these tests are not required by DTM policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Someone without peripheral venous access in arm veins adequate for apheresis (healthy&#xD;
             volunteers only).&#xD;
&#xD;

             adult volunteer at undue risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
