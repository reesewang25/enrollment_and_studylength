  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tremors are involuntary movements of a part or parts of the body that occur because of&#xD;
      alternating contraction and relaxation of muscles. The causes behind most tremors are poorly&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies suggest tremors could be caused by abnormalities in a particular area of the&#xD;
      brain called the olivary nucleus. Researchers believe that the cells making up the olivary&#xD;
      nucleus may be responsible for generating a central rhythm of the body and may therefore also&#xD;
      be responsible for the generation of tremors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of alcohol has been known to reduce tremors in some patients. Researchers believe&#xD;
      that the alcohol may work directly on the cells of the olivary nucleus. As a result,&#xD;
      researchers would like to determine the effects of alcohol on three different kinds of&#xD;
      tremors (physiological, symptomatic palatal, and essential palatal).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology and anatomical basis of most tremors remains poorly understood. One&#xD;
      particular theory of essential tremor, the olivary hypothesis, has gained support from&#xD;
      various studies. These studies point to the olivary nucleus as possible central rhythm&#xD;
      generator. Cells in the olivary nucleus show spontaneous rhythmic discharges that can be&#xD;
      suppressed by alcohol. Since alcohol is known to suppress tremor in some patients with&#xD;
      essential tremor, one can theorize that it is through its effect on the olivary nucleus; that&#xD;
      is, the inferior olive is the generator of the tremor. Given this assumption, we intend to&#xD;
      study the effect of alcohol on three different kinds of tremor: the 8-12 Hz component of&#xD;
      physiological tremor, symptomatic palatal tremor and essential palatal tremor. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the central generator of each of these types of tremor lies in the inferior olive and&#xD;
      that the ingestion of alcohol should reduce the amplitude of the tremor, similar to the&#xD;
      effect of alcohol seen in essential tremor.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A total of 20 subjects will be enrolled in the study. 10 normal subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
        in the study. All will have an 8-12 Hz component of physiologic tremor as determined by&#xD;
        neurophysiologic studies. Patients will have a prominent 8-12 Hz spike on accelerometry&#xD;
        recordings that is associated with an EMG spike at the same frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5 patients with essential palatal tremor and 5 patients with symptomatic palatal tremor&#xD;
        will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must be a minimum of 21 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any medical condition, such as liver disease, history or family history of&#xD;
        alcoholism, that can reasonably be expected to subject the patient to unwarranted risk or&#xD;
        compromise the value of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any patient with pathologic tremor, such as parkinsonian rest tremor, essential tremor, or&#xD;
        tremor secondary to medications or structural brain lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lack of effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to understand the nature of the study or its procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons under the age of 21, who are not of legal age to consume alcohol in Maryland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients taking any psychoactive medications including certain cough or cold medicine&#xD;
        preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No one will be excluded or discriminated against based on the grounds of race, creed,&#xD;
        gender, color, or national origin. Every attempt will be made to include women and&#xD;
        minorities in the study population.&#xD;
