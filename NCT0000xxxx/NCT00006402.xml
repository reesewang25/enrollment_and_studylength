      To determine the influences of diet and physical activity (PA) on total body fatness and&#xD;
      regional fat distribution and the relationship of these to risk factors of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease during adolescence.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult studies have shown that adiposity, especially visceral adipose tissue, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) fitness are key links between lifestyle factors like diet and exercise on&#xD;
      one hand, and CV disease on the other. However, very little is known about these links during&#xD;
      the juvenile years, when the processes leading to CV disease are at an early stage of&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in response to a Program Announcement issued in March 1998 on Diet and&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children and Adolescents. The Program Announcement, jointly&#xD;
      issued by the National Institute of Nursing Research and the NHLBI, sought to encourage&#xD;
      research relevant to the development and/or testing of dietary interventions to improve the&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles in children and adolescents, especially those at&#xD;
      increased risk for CVD or for development of CVD risk factors because of genetics, family&#xD;
      history, socioeconomic status (SES), race/ethnicity, levels of blood cholesterol or blood&#xD;
      pressure, or other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study determines the relations of free-living diet and exercise to total body percent fat&#xD;
      ( percent BF), visceral adipose tissue and CV fitness in black and white boys and girls of&#xD;
      varying socioeconomic status (SES). The study also determines the relations of fatness and&#xD;
      fitness to different CVD risk factors. A total of 800 15 to 18 year olds, 200 in each ethnic&#xD;
      and gender subgroup will be recruited. Diet will be assessed with seven 24-hour recalls, and&#xD;
      exercise with two seven-day recalls and heart rate monitoring. Percent body fat will be&#xD;
      measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, visceral adipose tissue with magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging and CV fitness with a multi-stage treadmill test. Measurements will be made&#xD;
      of major fatness- and fitness-related CV disease risk factors (e.g., total cholesterol:HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol ratio, insulin, systolic blood pressure, left ventricular mass indexed to height,&#xD;
      fibrinogen). Multivariate and univariate analyses will be conducted to determine&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
