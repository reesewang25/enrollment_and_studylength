  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine how much of a dose is absorbed by the body when zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine;&#xD;
      ddC ) is given orally and how long the drug stays in the body after absorption or intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests have shown that ddC is effective in stopping the growth of the HIV in test&#xD;
      tubes. The study will reveal the pharmacokinetic (blood levels) properties of this new drug&#xD;
      and how long the drug remains in the body at each of six doses. This should be useful&#xD;
      background information and should allow a simple and efficient comparative study of any new&#xD;
      oral formulation, such as a tablet or capsule, since dose-related problems will already be&#xD;
      known.&#xD;

      tubes. The study will reveal the pharmacokinetic (blood levels) properties of this new drug&#xD;
      and how long the drug remains in the body at each of six doses. This should be useful&#xD;

      oral formulation, such as a tablet or capsule, since dose-related problems will already be&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are hospitalized and receive ddC twice, once by mouth and once by IV injection. Each&#xD;
      patient receives the drug at one of six increasing doses, and no patient is studied at more&#xD;
      than one dose level. Following each dose, toxicity is measured before the next higher dose is&#xD;
      given. Several blood samples and urine specimens are taken to permit measurement of the&#xD;
      amount of drug in the bloodstream and of the speed with which it is eliminated from the body.&#xD;
