  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of different methods of birth control&#xD;
      (oral and injectable) on how the body absorbs, makes available, and removes zidovudine (ZDV).&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the differences in men and women in how the body absorbs, makes&#xD;
      available, and removes ZDV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past research has shown that the effectiveness of ZDV as an anti-HIV drug might be decreased&#xD;
      in individuals who use certain methods of birth control. ZDV may also have different effects&#xD;
      in men compared to women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oral contraceptives have been shown to substantially enhance the glucuronidation of several&#xD;
      compounds. One study reported enhanced glucuronidation of oxazepam, a compound that is&#xD;
      conjugated via the same UDP-glucuronyl transferase isozyme responsible for ADV&#xD;
      glucuronidation, suggesting that ZDV metabolism may be altered by concomitant oral&#xD;
      contraceptive use. This potential enhancement of ZDV metabolism by oral contraceptives is&#xD;
      expected to result in decreased plasma levels of the parent compound which may lead to&#xD;
      diminished clinical efficacy in women using these drugs. It remains unclear whether the&#xD;
      progesterone and/or estrogen component of oral contraceptives results in the observed&#xD;
      glucuronidation changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, pharmacokinetic trial is conducted in 2 steps. [AS PER AMENDMENT 6/12/01:&#xD;
      The Depo-Provera IM group in Step 2 is filled. Female patients who choose to participate in&#xD;
      Step 2 may enroll only in the Ortho-Novum 1/35 PO group.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/13/00: Female&#xD;
      patients may choose to participate in Step 1 alone or both Steps 1 and 2.] Male patients may&#xD;
      participate in Step 1 only as the control arm of the study. In Step 1, patients are&#xD;
      stratified by sex; in Step 2, female patients are stratified by their choice of contraception&#xD;
      (i.e., oral norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol [Ortho-Novum 1/35] or injectable&#xD;
      medroxyprogesterone acetate [Depo-Provera]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 (males and females): At entry, all patients are randomized to receive ZDV either&#xD;
      orally or orally and intravenously (IV) on Days 7 and 8. Female patients begin the study (Day&#xD;
      0) between days 10-18 after the first day of their last menstrual period (LMP) (Cycle 1). At&#xD;
      time of enrollment, female patients [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/13/00: who plan to participate in&#xD;
      Step 2] choose the form of birth control instituted in Step 2: Depo-Provera or Ortho-Novum&#xD;
      1/35. Male patients may enter Step 1 at any time. Patients continue taking their other&#xD;
      pre-study antiretroviral drugs during Step 1. [AS PER AMENDMENT 6/3/99: Patients taking&#xD;
      nelfinavir may participate only in the Depo-Provera arm.] Days 0-6: All patients receive oral&#xD;
      ZDV. Day 7: Patients are randomized to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 (females): oral ZDV for a total of 3 doses. Arm 2 (females): ZDV IV, then ZDV orally&#xD;
      for a total of 2 oral doses. Arm 3 (males): control arm. Half of the male patients receive&#xD;
      ZDV as in Arm 1 and the other male patients receive ZDV as in Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 8: Patients on all 3 arms receive the alternate form of ZDV to that received on Day 7.&#xD;
      Day 9: Female patients resume their pre-study method of administration of ZDV. Male patients&#xD;
      conclude their participation in the study on Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 (females [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/13/00: opting to participate in Step 2]): At the onset&#xD;
      of their second menstrual period (Cycle 2) since starting study, female patients start their&#xD;
      choice of Ortho-Novum 1/35 or intramuscularly administered Depo-Provera [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      6/12/01: Enrollment for Depo-Provera is closed]. Contraceptive therapy continues throughout&#xD;
      Step 2. Step 2 Days 0-6: Between days 7-11 [AS PER AMENDMENT 6/3/99: Between days 7-18] of&#xD;
      the third menstrual cycle (Cycle 3) since starting study, female patients continue their&#xD;
      pre-study antiretroviral therapy (as done in Step 1) and begin another course of ZDV standard&#xD;
      therapy 3 times daily. Days 7-8: Patients receive the original method of administration of&#xD;
      ZDV (as randomized at study entry). Female patients return for a final safety visit within 1&#xD;
      week of completing study Day 8 of Step 2.&#xD;
