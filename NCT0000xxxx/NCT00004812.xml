      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the ability of patients with and without sensorimotor loss below the&#xD;
      thoracic spinal cord injury to execute coordinated whole-limb synergies sufficient for&#xD;
      walking with full or partial weight support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Promote weight bearing, balance, and reciprocal leg movement in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Elicit synchronized motor output within and between limbs in these patients.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a controlled, prospective study. Patients pairs matched for strata&#xD;
      are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Patients are stratified into pairs by age,&#xD;
      time since onset, Frankel grade, and Motor Score Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group receives body weight-supported treadmill training immediately after baseline&#xD;
      clinical, biomechanical, and physiological measures. The second group is the control;&#xD;
      baseline measures are identical but training is delayed for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups receive training 3 days/week for 3 months. Initial treadmill velocity&#xD;
      is 18 meters/minute; velocity is increased in increments of 6 meters/minute until the maximum&#xD;
      speed is achieved at which each patient exhibits the best locomotor capability at full weight&#xD;
      bearing. Patients are trained with the minimal weight support assistance necessary for&#xD;
      effective limb progression without excessive knee flexion or hyperextension. Polypropylene&#xD;
      ankle-foot orthosis is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are re-tested after maximal treadmill velocity is achieved: following clonidine once&#xD;
      a day for 3 days; clonidine twice a day for 3 days; cyproheptadine for 3 days; and an&#xD;
      increased dose of cyproheptadine for 3 days. There is a 3-day washout between clonidine and&#xD;
      cyproheptadine testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are not advanced if they experience adverse cardiovascular effects during therapy.&#xD;
      No concurrent therapeutic exercise for the lower extremities is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinematic, temporal, kinetic, spasticity, Frankel grading, Motor Index Score, metabolic, and&#xD;
      functional outcome measures are evaluated at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Disease Characteristics-- Traumatic or ischemic spinal cord injury Single lesion between&#xD;
        thoracic vertebrae 1 and 12 Confirmed by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance&#xD;
        imaging At least 12 months since onset of injury Motor recovery as follows: Ability to step&#xD;
        not recovered OR Abnormal gait and maximum walking speed below one-half normal slow casual&#xD;
        velocity of 60 meters/minute --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- At least 3 months since&#xD;
