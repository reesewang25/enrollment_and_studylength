  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing&#xD;
      substances to them without harming normal cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as&#xD;
      sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral&#xD;
      blood. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
      Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with sargramostim or interleukin-2 may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy given with&#xD;
      sargramostim and interleukin-2 in treating children with neuroblastoma who have just&#xD;
      completed bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of monoclonal antibody (MOAB) ch14.18 when combined&#xD;
      with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) after autologous bone marrow or&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell rescue in children with neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, including antibody level, antibody-binding activity, and presence of human&#xD;
      anti-chimeric antibodies, of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the activity of IL-2 and MOAB ch14.18 against tumor cells in terms of response&#xD;
      using standard clinical measurements such as bone marrow immunocytology in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the extent of coating of tumor cells (bone marrow metastases) by MOAB ch14.18 in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the feasibility of isotretinoin administered between courses beginning after&#xD;
      course 2 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of monoclonal antibody (MOAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive MOAB IV over 5 hours on days 7-10 during courses 2 and 4 and on days 3-6&#xD;
      during courses 1, 3, and 5; sargramostim (GM-CSF) IV over 2 hours or subcutaneously daily on&#xD;
      days 0-13 during courses 1, 3, and 5; interleukin-2 IV continuously on days 0-3 and 7-10&#xD;
      during courses 2 and 4; and oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 14-27 during courses 2 and&#xD;
      4 and on days 10-23 during courses 3 and 5. Treatment repeats every 24-32 days for 5 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MOAB until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A minimum of 6 additional patients are treated at&#xD;
      the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every other week for 2 months and then every 3 months for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-16 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.&#xD;
