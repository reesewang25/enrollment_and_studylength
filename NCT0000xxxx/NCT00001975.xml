  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberous sclerosis is a rare, hereditary disease in which patients develop multiple tumors.&#xD;
      Although not cancerous, the tumors can affect various organs, including the heart, lungs,&#xD;
      kidneys, skin, and central nervous system, with serious medical consequences. The severity of&#xD;
      disease varies greatly among patients, from barely detectable to fatal. This study will&#xD;
      investigate what causes skin tumors to develop in patients with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tuberous sclerosis 18 years and older may enroll in this study. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo a medical history and thorough skin examination by a dermatologist. Those with&#xD;
      skin tumors will be asked to undergo biopsy (tissue removal) of up to eight lesions, under a&#xD;
      local anesthetic, for research purposes. The biopsies will all be done the same day. The&#xD;
      tissue samples will be used for: examination of genetic changes, measurement of certain&#xD;
      proteins and other substances, and growing in culture to study the genetics of tuberous&#xD;
      sclerosis.&#xD;

      Patients with tuberous sclerosis develop benign cutaneous tumors that are typically multiple&#xD;
      in number and location. These tumors include facial angiofibromas, forehead plaques, shagreen&#xD;
      patches, periungual fibromas, and gingival fibromas. The tumors are permanent, slow growing,&#xD;
      and often disfiguring. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the molecular basis for&#xD;
      these tumors. Specifically, we plan to identify the genetically altered cells in these&#xD;
      hamartomatous lesions, and to quantify factors (e.g. cytokines) produced by these cells which&#xD;
      induce the growth of these tumors. To accomplish this, we plan to obtain samples of these&#xD;
      cutaneous tumors, to test tumor DNA for loss of heterozygosity, and to measure RNA and&#xD;
      protein expression levels.&#xD;

        Patients will be those already diagnosed with TSC (definite or possible) based on clinical&#xD;
        criteria and/or genetic testing, and ranging in age from 18 to 90 years old.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be those already diagnosed with TSC (definite, probable, or possible) based&#xD;
        on clinical criteria and/or genetic testing, and ranging in age from 18 to 90 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The clinical features of TSC considered of major significance are: facial angiofibromas or&#xD;
        forehead plaque, nontraumatic periungual fibromas, three or more hypomelanotic macules,&#xD;
        shagreen patch, multiple retinal nodular hamartomas, cortical tuber, subependymal nodule,&#xD;
        subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, cardiac rhabdomyoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and&#xD;
        renal angiomyolipoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The minor features of TSC are: multiple randomly distributed pits in dental enamel,&#xD;
        hamartomatous rectal polyps, bone cysts, cerebral white matter radial migration lines,&#xD;
        gingival fibromas, nonrenal hamartoma, retinal achromic patch, confetti skin lesions, and&#xD;
        multiple renal cysts (5). Definite TSC is diagnosed by the presence of two major features&#xD;
        or one major feature plus two minor features. Probable TSC is diagnosed by the presence of&#xD;
        one major feature and one minor feature. Possible TSC is diagnosed by the presence of&#xD;
        either one major feature or two or more minor features. Patients will not be preselected&#xD;
        for skin lesions, but about 80% of patients with TSC are expected to have skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tendency to keloid formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allergy to anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bleeding abnormality.&#xD;
