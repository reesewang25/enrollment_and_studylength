      Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Irradiation of tumor and&#xD;
      involved nodes using 4-6 MV photons (brachytherapy allowed to boost primary tumor; electrons&#xD;
      allowed to boost posterior neck and massive adenopathy); plus Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers),&#xD;
      Taxol, TAX, NSC-125973.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the toxicity of a five day infusion of Paclitaxel&#xD;
      concurrent with radiation therapy for advanced head and neck cancers. Patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated Stage III and IV squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the oral cavity,&#xD;
      oropharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx and maxillary sinus, as well as Stage II SCC of&#xD;
      the base of the tongue, nasopharynx, and maxillary sinus will be eligible. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      will be delivered at 180 cGy per day to a total dose 6660-7200 cGy. Individual neck nodes can&#xD;
      be boosted with electrons up to 7600 cGy. Patients will also receive Paclitaxel as a&#xD;
      continuous IV infusion of 120 mg/m(2) over 120 hours through a central venous catheter.&#xD;
      Tolerance of this regimen will be judged by using the RTOG and CTEP standard toxicity&#xD;
      criteria and by following the median elapsed treatment time. Serial tumor biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained to measure the following parameters: tumor potential doubling time (Tpot),&#xD;
      paclitaxel levels in tumor, and biological effects upon the cell cycle.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must satisfy the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must have a biopsy proven diagnosis of carcinoma of the oral cavity,&#xD;
        oropharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, maxillary sinus. Squamous cell,&#xD;
        lymphoepithelioma, transitional cell and undifferentiated histologies will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will accept AJCC stages III-IV for all the sites, except base of tongue, nasopharynx,&#xD;
        and maxillary sinus where we will accept stage II patients as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have no surgical option or have refused surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with evidence of distant metastasis not confined to the region of the head and&#xD;
        neck will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will be evaluated by either the NIH or National Naval Medical Center (NNMC)&#xD;
        Otolaryngology-head and neck surgery center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have had no prior radiotherapy to the head and neck region and no prior&#xD;
        treatment with chemotherapy for their head and neck cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a performance status of less then or equal to 2 (ECOG Criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have an absolute granulocyte count of greater than or equal to 2000/mm(3) and&#xD;
        a platelet count of greater than or equal to 100,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should have adequate hepatic and renal function as indicated by a serum bilirubin&#xD;
        of less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl and SGOT of less than or equal to 4.0 times the upper&#xD;
        limit of the institutional norm and a serum creatinine of less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No other serious concurrent medical or psychiatric illness which would jeopardize the&#xD;
        ability of the patient to receive with reasonable safety the chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
        therapy outlined in this protocol is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No other active, concomitant malignancy other than curatively treated carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
        the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Signed informed consent: Each patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her&#xD;
        disease and willingly consent after being informed of the procedure to be followed, the&#xD;
        experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks,&#xD;
        and discomforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women and nursing mothers are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible patients of childbearing potential should use contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be registered on the protocol by telephone. An authorized physician will&#xD;
        telephone information concerning a potential candidate for this protocol to the Orkand&#xD;
        personnel in their Central Clinical Data Management Registration Office at (301) 402-1732&#xD;
        between the hours of 8:30 am to 5:00 pm Monday through Friday.&#xD;
