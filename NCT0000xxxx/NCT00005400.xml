      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early in gestation maternal blood volume normally expands by an unknown mechanism; failure of&#xD;
      this normal adaptation to pregnancy has been associated with common adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes including preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, and premature labor. The&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system has a critical role in controlling maternal fluid volume and&#xD;
      probably in the pathophysiology of these serious complications of pregnancy. Kenneth Ward and&#xD;
      his group have recently discovered DNA variants which cause amino acid substitutions in&#xD;
      angiotensinogen (renin substrate), one of which (T235) is strongly associated with&#xD;
      preeclampsia. They hypothesize that functionally different angiotensinogen proteins may&#xD;
      underlie the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and other related disorders (such as&#xD;
      intrauterine growth retardation and premature labor) by not allowing normal volume expansion&#xD;
      to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four interrelated approaches in the study should lead to a better understanding of the&#xD;
      role of angiotensinogen in pregnancy and of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Unlike any&#xD;
      previous finding in preeclamptic patients, the genetic alteration in angiotensinogen&#xD;
      described is an intrinsic defect which, although it may be modified by other factors, cannot&#xD;
      be 'secondary' to other pathophysiologic variables. This molecular hypothesis demands a&#xD;
      reinterpretation of many prior findings in preeclampsia, fetal growth retardation, and&#xD;
      premature labor based on angiotensinogen genotypes. The DNA and plasma collected for this&#xD;
      study will be invaluable resources for future molecular investigations of abnormal&#xD;
      pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four different strategies were used. First, a prospective, epidemiologic survey of 24,000&#xD;
      pregnancies was conducted to determine the role of the T235 variant in common disorders of&#xD;
      pregnancy. From this population, nulligravida volunteers, 150 who were homozygous for T235&#xD;
      variant and 150 who were homozygous for the alternative M235 allele, were selected for a&#xD;
      longitudinal study of maternal-fetal physiology and biochemistry in order to determine how&#xD;
      and when the T235 variant exerted its adverse effect. Taking advantage of the large average&#xD;
      family size in Utah, the female relatives of women with preeclampsia were also studied in&#xD;
      order to define the genetics of important angiotensinogen variants. Finally, DNA from&#xD;
      preeclamptic patients was examined for additional mutations in the angiotensinogen gene which&#xD;
      may offer unique pathophysiologic insight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 1999 for another four years to investigate the hypothesis that&#xD;
      disease-associated angiotensinogen alleles promote abnormal spiral artery remodeling and&#xD;
      inhibit maternal plasma volume expansion.&#xD;
