      To determine whether histocompatibility matching of corneal transplant donors and recipients&#xD;
      can reduce the incidence of graft rejection in high-risk patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 percent of corneal transplant patients, about 6,000 per year, face donor&#xD;
      tissue rejection at rates of up to 60 percent because of corneal vascularization or prior&#xD;
      graft rejection. Histocompatibility antigen matching and/or crossmatching may have offered&#xD;
      these patients an improved chance for successful outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Collaborative Corneal Transplantation Studies Group conducted two controlled,&#xD;
      double-masked studies addressing distinct scientific questions about donor-recipient&#xD;
      histocompatibility matching. The Crossmatch Study was a randomized study assessing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of crossmatching in preventing graft rejection among high-risk patients with&#xD;
      lymphocytotoxic antibodies. The Antigen Matching Study was a prospective, double-masked,&#xD;
      observational study of the effectiveness of HLA-A, -B, and -DR donor-recipient matching in&#xD;
      high-risk patients who had no lymphocytotoxic antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six clinical centers recruited high-risk patients and collaborated with their local eye&#xD;
      banking and organ procurement agencies in procuring donor corneal tissue. For each of the two&#xD;
      studies, a total of 400 patients were sought. Blood samples from each enrolled patient were&#xD;
      sent to the local CCTS tissue typing laboratory for HLA typing, and serum samples were sent&#xD;
      to the Central Laboratory to be screened for preformed lymphocytotoxic antibodies. Depending&#xD;
      on the results of the testing, patients were entered into the Crossmatch Study or the Antigen&#xD;
      Matching Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As corneal donors became available, donor blood samples were HLA typed at the local&#xD;
      laboratories and crossmatched against all CCTS patients who awaited transplantation. Results&#xD;
      of the testing were entered in a national, 24-hour computerized allocation system operated by&#xD;
      the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Patients in the Crossmatch Study received a&#xD;
      cornea from either a positively crossmatched donor or a negatively crossmatched donor.&#xD;
      Patients in the Antigen Matching Study received a cornea with 0 to 6 matched antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant patients were followed intensively during the first months after surgery. The&#xD;
      number of clinic visits was tapered to 2 during the third and final year of followup,&#xD;
      resulting in a total of 17 postoperative visits. Irreversible failure of the corneal&#xD;
      allograft due to all causes was the primary outcome variable in both studies. Allograft&#xD;
      reaction episodes, irreversible failure due to rejection, and visual acuity were secondary&#xD;
      outcome variables.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Males and females age 10 years or older with two to four quadrants of corneal stroma&#xD;
        vascularization or a history of allograft rejection in the eye considered for surgery were&#xD;
        eligible for both studies in the CCTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have been willing to participate in 3 years of followup. No one was eligible&#xD;
        for the CCTS who had a condition that would greatly increase the risk of nonrejection graft&#xD;
        failure, such as xerophthalmia or severe exposure keratopathy. Also excluded were patients&#xD;
        with systemic diseases or with medication usage that might alter their immune response.&#xD;
