  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part A: To evaluate the impact of HSV suppression with acyclovir ( ACV ) on HIV burden in&#xD;
      patients with asymptomatic HSV infection and at high risk for HSV reactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: To characterize the change in plasma HIV RNA levels and other measures of HIV burden&#xD;
      during and after a 10 day course of ACV treatment for acute HSV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 70% of patients infected with HIV are concurrently infected with HSV. There is&#xD;
      new evidence to suggest that HSV may act as a co-factor in HIV disease progression. This&#xD;
      study will attempt to determine if the upregulation of HIV RNA that occurs during symptomatic&#xD;
      HSV reactivation also occurs during asymptomatic HSV reactivation and if suppression of HSV&#xD;
      will result in decreased levels of HIV RNA. There is a need to determine the patterns of&#xD;
      association between HSV and HIV.&#xD;

      Approximately 70% of patients infected with HIV are concurrently infected with HSV. There is&#xD;
      new evidence to suggest that HSV may act as a co-factor in HIV disease progression. This&#xD;
      study will attempt to determine if the upregulation of HIV RNA that occurs during symptomatic&#xD;
      HSV reactivation also occurs during asymptomatic HSV reactivation and if suppression of HSV&#xD;
      will result in decreased levels of HIV RNA. There is a need to determine the patterns of&#xD;
      association between HSV and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: 60 approved HIV infected patients will be randomized to either suppressive ACV&#xD;
      therapy or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Serology for HSV serum antibodies will be obtained&#xD;
      at screening and a full history and physical exam will be performed on Day 1 and interval&#xD;
      examinations at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Extensive clinical exams will be conducted on a regular&#xD;
      schedule throughout the 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: 15 approved HIV infected patients will receive treatment with ACV until resolution of&#xD;
      the lesion. All patients will be monitored on Day 9-12 of ACV therapy for crusting and&#xD;
      resolutions of HSV lesions and will be followed for 3.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS PER AMENDMENT 3/11/97: Noncommercial active acyclovir will be made available for Part A&#xD;
      patients wo develop acute HSV while on study and for Part B patients who develop acute HSV&#xD;
      after completion of the acute phase of treatment ( i.e., during the follow-up phase).&#xD;
