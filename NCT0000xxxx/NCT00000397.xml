  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of a nondrug treatment for the insomnia that often occurs&#xD;
      in people with fibromyalgia. The treatment is a type of psychotherapy called&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy combines cognitive therapy, which&#xD;
      can modify or eliminate thought patterns contributing to the person's symptoms, and&#xD;
      behavioral therapy, which aims to help the person change his or her behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent and debilitating condition that contributes to impaired&#xD;
      occupational and social functioning and increased disability among affected individuals. The&#xD;
      vast majority of people with FM experience persistent sleep disturbances (e.g., onset&#xD;
      difficulty, repeated or extended awakenings, nonrestorative sleep) that worsen other&#xD;
      FM-related symptoms (e.g., chronic pain, fatigue) and sustain their general dysfunction.&#xD;
      Pharmacologic treatments (e.g., antidepressants, hypnotics) may reduce symptoms for some&#xD;
      people with FM, but many FM patients display little enduring improvement in their sleep and&#xD;
      other FM-related symptoms in response to such agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our clinical observations and initial pilot work suggest that factors common among other&#xD;
      insomnia subtypes such as conditioned bedtime arousal, erratic sleep/wake scheduling, and&#xD;
      spending too much time in bed likely perpetuate the sleep problems of these&#xD;
      medication-refractory FM patients. Over the past decade, we have developed, refined, and&#xD;
      repeatedly tested a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that has proven effective for reducing&#xD;
      sleep disturbances perpetuated by such underlying cognitive/behavioral mechanisms. The major&#xD;
      objectives of this project are to conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial to confirm&#xD;
      these preliminary findings and to determine the efficacy of CBT insomnia treatment for&#xD;
      interrupting the disturbed nocturnal sleep and daytime pain, fatigue, and distress symptom&#xD;
      complex that defines FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One arm of this study's three-by-four factorial design will compare CBT with both a contact&#xD;
      control treatment and standard care. The other arm in the design is a repeated-measures&#xD;
      factor consisting of four time points (i.e., baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up periods) at which we will assess outcome. We will assess participants at&#xD;
      all four time points with objective (wrist actigraphy) and subjective (sleep logs, Insomnia&#xD;
      Symptom Questionnaire) measures of sleep improvements, measures of subjective pain, and&#xD;
      questionnaires that assess mood (State-Trait Anxiety and Beck Depression Scales) and general&#xD;
      quality of life (SF-36). We will conduct multivariate statistical analyses and tests of&#xD;
      clinical significance with these various measures. We will also conduct exploratory analyses&#xD;
      to determine if polysomnographically-derived sleep measures obtained prior to treatment&#xD;
      correlate with initial levels of pain and distress or eventual treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results should provide information about the usefulness of CBT for treating FM-related sleep&#xD;
      difficulties. Results should also improve understanding of the FM syndrome in general and&#xD;
      provide new information about the potential role of behavioral therapy in the overall&#xD;
      management of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals interested in participating in this study should live within reasonable commuting&#xD;
      distance from the Duke University Medical Center (Durham, NC), because this research requires&#xD;
      multiple outpatient visits for screening and treatment.&#xD;
