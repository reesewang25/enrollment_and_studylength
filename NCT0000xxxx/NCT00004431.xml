      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of L-baclofen in patients with refractory trigeminal&#xD;
      neuralgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerance of L-baclofen in these patients.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to receive either L-baclofen or placebo orally at increasing daily&#xD;
      doses for 1 week. Patients then continue to receive the maximum dosage acceptable for a 1&#xD;
      week maintenance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, thereafter, may enroll in a long term open label study with L-baclofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Disease Characteristics-- Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia - Paroxysmal attacks of facial&#xD;
        or frontal pain lasting a few seconds to less than 2 minutes - Pain has at least 4 of the&#xD;
        following characteristics: Distribution along one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve&#xD;
        Sudden, intense, sharp, superficial, stabbing, or burning quality Pain intensity severe&#xD;
        Precipitation from trigger areas, or by certain daily activities such as eating, talking,&#xD;
        washing the face, or cleaning the teeth Between paroxysms entirely asymptomatic - No&#xD;
        neurological deficit - Attacks are stereotyped in the individual patient - Exclusion of&#xD;
        other causes of facial pain by history, physical examination and special investigations&#xD;
        when necessary Must be uncontrolled or refractory as defined by occurrence of at least 2&#xD;
        paroxysms of pain per day despite conventional treatment with maximally tolerated doses of&#xD;
        carbamazepine --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- No concurrent medication for trigeminal&#xD;
        neuralgia other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, and neurontin Concurrent medication for&#xD;
        other conditions allowed Concurrent medication must be on stable dose(s) --Patient&#xD;
        Characteristics-- Hepatic: No significant hepatic disease Renal: No significant renal&#xD;
        disease Neurological: No evidence of progressing neurological disorder (e.g., intracranial&#xD;
        neoplasm, multiple sclerosis) Other: No history of drug abuse Not pregnant Effective&#xD;
        contraception required of all fertile patients&#xD;
