      To assess the relative long-term safety and efficacy of percutaneous transluminal coronary&#xD;
      angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with&#xD;
      multivessel disease and severe angina or ischemia who required revascularization and had&#xD;
      coronary anatomy suitable for either procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease has evolved considerably&#xD;
      in the past twenty years with the application of invasive techniques in an ever increasing&#xD;
      proportion of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With refinements in CABG surgery over the past twenty years, operative myocardial&#xD;
      revascularization is feasible in most patients with myocardial ischemia. Several multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized trials have been reported, comparing medical with surgical management in patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease. Based on the three largest trials and an extensive&#xD;
      observational literature, a consensus appears to be emerging regarding the circumstances&#xD;
      under which medical or surgical management appears to be the method of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear that CABG relieves angina in the vast majority of patients with severe symptoms.&#xD;
      It is also apparent that this procedure can be performed with very low risk by experienced&#xD;
      operative teams. Thus, CABG is indicated for patients with suitable coronary anatomy who have&#xD;
      severe angina refractory to medical therapy and those with significant obstruction of left&#xD;
      main coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing of operative intervention in patients with less severe angina is a point of some&#xD;
      dispute at present. It is, however, apparent that certain categories of patients have&#xD;
      improved survival after elective bypass surgery. These categories include patients with left&#xD;
      main coronary stenosis, triple vessel disease with modestly impaired ventricular function,&#xD;
      and possibly other clinically defined high risk patients. The remaining patients with mild,&#xD;
      symptomatic coronary disease, it would appear, can afford to defer operative intervention&#xD;
      until such time as symptoms worsen and require palliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term information is available on some patients who had CABG in the early 1970s. By ten&#xD;
      years substantial progression of disease is present in both the native coronary circulation&#xD;
      and in the bypass grafts. Investigators have reported that as many as two-thirds of vein&#xD;
      bypass grafts are closed or narrowed and intrinsic coronary disease has progressed in as many&#xD;
      as one-half of non-bypassed vessels at 10 years following surgery. The timing of surgery in&#xD;
      less severely symptomatic patients, strategies to decrease disease progression in grafted&#xD;
      vessels and native circulation, and renewed interest in the use of the internal mammary&#xD;
      artery to revascularize the heart are very active research issues at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTCA was first applied to human coronary disease in 1977. There have been major advances in&#xD;
      catheter design, balloon construction, and identification of both high and low risk patients&#xD;
      for this procedure. Experienced angioplasty teams can now successfully dilate severe lesions&#xD;
      in more than 90 percent of patients attempted. This success rate can be achieved with less&#xD;
      than one percent operative mortality and less than five percent myocardial infarction and/or&#xD;
      emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, as many as one-third of successfully&#xD;
      dilated patients will experience the return of angina within the following six months to one&#xD;
      year, reflecting restenosis of the dilated lesion. Most of these individuals can successfully&#xD;
      undergo a second dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, two quite effective interventions are available for patients with symptomatic coronary&#xD;
      artery disease sufficient to require palliation by some mechanical means. Each has strengths&#xD;
      and weaknesses. PTCA is relatively noninvasive, requires initially fewer hospital days and&#xD;
      less intensive care, and preserves veins and mediastinum for CABG should it be required&#xD;
      later. However, not all lesions present in a patient with multivessel disease can be dilated.&#xD;
      There is substantial risk of restenosis and recurrence of symptoms, and a small but finite&#xD;
      risk of having to undergo immediate CABG surgery following a failed PTCA, considerably&#xD;
      increasing the risk of the surgery. CABG surgery results in more complete revascularization&#xD;
      and relatively low short-term graft closure, and it can be done with an acute risk&#xD;
      approximately equal to PTCA. However, it is apparent that surgical intervention does not&#xD;
      change a patient's propensity to atherosclerosis; in ten years two-thirds of grafts have been&#xD;
      compromised with atherosclerosis or thrombosis and there has been progression of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in the native, non-bypassed coronary circulation in roughly one-half of the&#xD;
      patients. Second operations are considerably more difficult technically, carry a higher&#xD;
      operative risk, and result in less dramatic relief of symptoms. There is a substantial&#xD;
      population of patients with severe, symptomatic, multivessel coronary disease in whom it is&#xD;
      unclear whether PTCA or CABG should be applied first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In September 1984, the Workshop on Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery recommended&#xD;
      consideration of a clinical trial involving surgery and angioplasty. An NHLBI Task Force,&#xD;
      established in January 1985, recommended that a clinical trial in multivessel coronary artery&#xD;
      disease be considered by the Institute. The Cardiology Advisory Committee unanimously&#xD;
      recommended the design and execution of a trial. In September 1985, the National Heart, Lung,&#xD;
      and Blood Advisory Council discussed this clinical trial initiative and recommended it&#xD;
      enthusiastically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who received coronary arteriography at the clinical units because of severe angina&#xD;
      or unstable angina, with or without antecedent myocardial infarction, were asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study. A total of 2,013 eligible patients who refused randomization and&#xD;
      422 who were ineligible on the basis of angiographic findings were asked to participate in&#xD;
      the follow-up registry. The remaining patients were then randomized, 914 to CABG and 915 to&#xD;
      PTCA, between August 1988 and August 1991. Baseline data included the clinical profile,&#xD;
      12-lead electrocardiogram, and information on coronary angiographic features, angina and&#xD;
      functional status, medications, risk factors, and quality of life. Initial revascularization&#xD;
      was performed within two weeks after randomization. Angiograms (baseline and sub study&#xD;
      directed at 1 year and 5 years), and ECG's are interpreted by respective core laboratories.&#xD;
      Scheduled multiple stages of PTCA were counted as a single procedure. New interventional&#xD;
      devices, such as stents, were not used during the initial revascularization. Follow-up visits&#xD;
      were conducted at the clinics at weeks four through fourteen after study entry and at one,&#xD;
      three, and five years, with telephone contacts at six months and two and four years. The&#xD;
      importance of risk factor modification was emphasized throughout the study to the patients&#xD;
      and their primary physicians. The primary end point was mortality from all causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has been extended through November 2002 to complete the minimum ten-year followup&#xD;
      on all BARI patients, determine the relative efficacy of PTCA versus CABG in subgroups of&#xD;
      women, Blacks, diabetics, and elderly, and assess the public health impact of BARI. In the&#xD;
      followup, all currently enrolled patients will have annual telephone interviews. At ten&#xD;
      years, the electrocardiogram will be obtained on all patients and blood lipid levels will be&#xD;
      performed on randomized patients only. All hospitalizations that occurred since the last&#xD;
      contact will be identified on the annual telephone contact. Angina will be assessed for the&#xD;
      preceding six weeks. At each patient contact, patients will be instructed in behavior&#xD;
      modification in the areas of smoking cessation, exercise, and diet. Angiographic studies will&#xD;
      also be conducted as part of the ten-year follow-up. The four centers which participated in&#xD;
      the first phase of these BARI activities will again conduct the angiograms. Patients will&#xD;
      consist of the established cohort drawn from the randomized participants who completed one&#xD;
      and five year angiograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substudy of BARI, Study of Economics and Quality of Life (SEQOL), was initially funded by&#xD;
      the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to assess the impact of a specific revascularization on&#xD;
      quality of life, functional and economic (hospital and physician charges) outcomes in&#xD;
      patients randomized to BARI, and to examine factors other than treatments that affect these&#xD;
      outcomes. Beginning in July 1997, support for SEQOL was assumed by the NHLBI under grant&#xD;
      R01HL58324. The grant, ending in June 2002, extends the follow-up of the randomized SEQOL&#xD;
      substudy cohort (752 subjects surviving as of May 1, 1996) to ten years to study the&#xD;
      long-term determinants of cost and quality of life and to develop a model to project the&#xD;
      impact of technologic changes on outcomes and cost of CABG and PTCA.&#xD;
