  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-month study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hydroxyurea in treating&#xD;
      beta-thalassemia, a type of anemia caused by defective hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying&#xD;
      pigment in blood). Hemoglobin is composed of two protein chains-alpha globin chains and beta&#xD;
      globin chains; patients with beta-thalassemia do not make beta globin. Patients often require&#xD;
      frequent red blood cell transfusions. This leads to iron overload, which, in turn, requires&#xD;
      iron chelation therapy (removal of iron from the blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some drugs, including hydroxyurea, can stimulate production of a third type of protein chain&#xD;
      called gamma chains. In the womb, the fetus makes this type of protein instead of beta&#xD;
      globin. It is not until after birth, when the fetus no longer produces gamma globin that the&#xD;
      beta globin deficiency becomes apparent. Gamma chain synthesis improves hemoglobin and red&#xD;
      blood cell production, correcting the anemia. This study will determine if and at what dose&#xD;
      hydroxyurea treatment reduces patients' need for red blood cell transfusions and whether&#xD;
      certain factors might predict which patients are likely benefit from this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 15 years and older with moderately severe beta-thalassemia may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants will take hydroxyurea daily at a dose calculated according to the&#xD;
      patient's body size. Blood will be drawn weekly to measure blood cell and platelet counts.&#xD;
      The drug dosage may be increased after 12 weeks of treatment and again after 24 weeks if the&#xD;
      white cell and platelet counts remain stable. Patients who respond dramatically to treatment&#xD;
      may continue to receive hydroxyurea for up to 3 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with homozygous beta thalassemia are either severely anemic or dependent on blood&#xD;
      transfusion to sustain life. Deficient synthesis of the beta chain leads to imbalanced chain&#xD;
      synthesis with an excess of alpha globin. This alpha globin precipitates, causing ineffective&#xD;
      erythropoiesis and shortened red cell survival. Hydroxyurea is a cell-cycle specific agent&#xD;
      that blocks DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonuclease reductase, the enzyme that converts&#xD;
      ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Administration of hydroxyurea to primates and more&#xD;
      than 300 patients with sickle cell anemia has been frequently, but not invariably associated&#xD;
      with a substantial increase in synthesis of gamma globin. In patients with homozygous&#xD;
      beta-thalassemia, enhanced gamma globin synthesis could partially compensate for the&#xD;
      deficient synthesis of beta globin rendering chain synthesis more balanced and reducing the&#xD;
      relative excess of alpha chains. The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      chronic daily low dose administration of hydroxyurea will enhance gamma globin synthesis,&#xD;
      increase red cell production and partially or substantially correct the anemia in patients&#xD;
      with homozygous beta-thalassemia. The effect of treatment will be monitored by serial&#xD;
      determination of the hemoglobin and hematocrit. The relationship between response to therapy&#xD;
      and the specific beta-globin mutation(s) will also be analyzed. This study will therefore&#xD;
      examine a cohort of patients not previously treated with hydroxyurea.&#xD;
