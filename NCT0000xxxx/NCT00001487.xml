  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland. As humans grow&#xD;
      older the levels of DHEA naturally decrease. Low levels of DHEA have been associated with a&#xD;
      variety of harmful effects, including increased heart disease, decreased immune system&#xD;
      function, decreased bone density (osteoporosis), high cholesterol, and increased fat to&#xD;
      muscle ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood levels of DHEA and its sulfate form, DHEA-S, begin dropping when humans are in their&#xD;
      20's. By the time humans are in their 40's and 50's, levels of DHEA and DHEA-S levels are at&#xD;
      50% of their peak. Previous studies have shown that levels of these hormones are associated&#xD;
      with feelings of &quot;well-being&quot; and enjoyment of &quot;leisure&quot; activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers are interested in the effects on mood and behavior of DHEA in men&#xD;
      and women with mid-life related mood disorders. Specifically, researchers would like to find&#xD;
      out if increasing levels of DHEA will lessen the symptoms associated with these disorders.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland in concentrations&#xD;
      that decrease with age. In humans low DHEA levels have been associated with a variety of&#xD;
      adverse biological consequences, including increased cardiovascular disease, decreased immune&#xD;
      function, decreased bone density, negative lipid profile and an increased fat to muscle&#xD;
      ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we investigate the effects on mood and behavior of DHEA in men and women with&#xD;
      midlife-related mood disorders in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. We&#xD;
      specifically ask whether increasing DHEA levels will mitigate any or all of the&#xD;
      neurasthenia-like symptoms characteristic of these disorders.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects for this study will meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A current episode of minor (meeting 3-4 criterion symptoms) or major depression of moderate&#xD;
        severity or less on the SCID severity scale for depression and not meeting DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
        symptom #9 (suicide) as determined by the administration of the minor depression module of&#xD;
        the SADS-L and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Additionally, to ensure that&#xD;
        subjects meet a minimum threshold for severity of depression, subjects will have scores&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 10 on either the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or the Center for&#xD;
        Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) Scale during at least three of the four clinic&#xD;
        visits during the two month screening phase. Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of&#xD;
        the following criteria: major depression of greater than moderate severity, DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
        #9 (suicide), or anyone requiring immediate treatment after clinical assessment, functional&#xD;
        impairment ratings of five or six for more than seven consecutive days on daily ratings;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 40-65;&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior hormonal therapy for the treatment of menopause/andropause-related mood or&#xD;
        physical symptoms within the last six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        In good medical health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following conditions will constitute contradictions to treatment with DHEA and will&#xD;
        preclude a subject's participation in this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive (threshold) response to SCID major depression section item #9, suicidal ideation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anyone requiring immediate treatment after clinical assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severity ratings greater than moderate on the SCID;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Functional impairment ratings of five or six for more than seven consecutive days on daily&#xD;
        ratings&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current treatment with antidepressant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prostate nodules or cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Moderate symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy such as hesitancy, urgency, frequent&#xD;
        voiding and feeling of incomplete voiding&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of ischemic cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hepatic dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women with a history of carcinoma of the breast, or any women with a family history of the&#xD;
        following: premenopausal breast cancer or bilateral breast cancer in a first degree&#xD;
        relative; multiple family members (greater than three relatives) with postmenopausal breast&#xD;
        cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women with a history of uterine cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a known hypersensitivity to DHEA or other androgens&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women&#xD;
