  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Voriconazole is a new drug developed to treat fungal infections. As of March 1999, the drug&#xD;
      had been studied in more than 1,900 healthy volunteers or patients with fungal infections.&#xD;
      This study will test extended use of voriconazole in patients with serious fungal infections&#xD;
      for which there are no approved therapies, and in patients who did not improve with or could&#xD;
      not tolerate standard therapy. It will evaluate the drug's safety, effectiveness, and&#xD;
      toleration in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients previous enrolled in protocol 99-C-0094 who improved with voriconazole treatment are&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Before beginning treatment, patients will have a physical&#xD;
      examination, including blood and urine tests, and an eye examination. They may also have&#xD;
      X-ray or CT imaging. Voriconazole will then be given twice a day either by infusion into a&#xD;
      vein or by tablets taken by mouth for up to 12 weeks. Patients will be examined at weeks 4, 8&#xD;
      and 12 of the study and one week after treatment stops. Blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected at each visit. An eye examination will be done at the end of the treatment period&#xD;
      and at other visits if vision problems develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole is active against fungal infections and may produce fewer side effects than&#xD;
      standard therapy.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and toleration of&#xD;
      voriconazole in the treatment of systemic or invasive fungal infections due to fungal&#xD;
      pathogens for which there is no licensed therapy or that are unresponsive or intolerant to&#xD;
      treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents. This trial is an extension of the Phase&#xD;
      III multicenter, open label study investigating the utilization of voriconazole for the&#xD;
      treatment of systemic or invasive fungal infections. Enrollment is targeted for 100 patients&#xD;
      to be recruited from multiple centers. The patient population will consist of patients with&#xD;
      proven deeply invasive fungal infection for which there is no licensed therapy or if the&#xD;
      patient is failing or intolerant to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents and&#xD;
      currently on the voriconazole (99-C-0094) protocol. Voriconazole will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously at 3-4 mg/kg q 12 hours or orally at 200-300 mg BID. Efficacy will be evaluated&#xD;
      by clinical, radiological and microbiological response.&#xD;

        Males or (non-pregnant, lactating and nursing) females equal to or greater than 12 years of&#xD;
        age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous enrollment into and completion of voriconazole therapy in protocol 99-C-0094&#xD;
        investigating the use of voriconazole in the treatment of invasive fungal disease or&#xD;
        empirical treatment of presumed fungal infections and enrolled within three weeks of&#xD;
        completion of 99-C-0094B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical benefit was derived from previous voriconazole treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Further clinical benefit is expected with extended voriconazole treatment.&#xD;
