      This study is designed to examine the blood flow, the nutrition, and the beating function of&#xD;
      the heart under different conditions. Patients with narrowed coronary arteries my have&#xD;
      restricted blood flow to the heart. The lowered blood supply to the heart muscle may not&#xD;
      cause symptoms immediately. However, as the heart pumps faster and harder the blood supply&#xD;
      demand is increased. If blood flow is unable supply enough oxygen and nutrition to heart&#xD;
      muscle patients can experience symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. Even after the&#xD;
      heart slows down and demand for oxygen and nutrition is reduced, patients can still&#xD;
      experience pain and abnormal heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in blood flow and the beating function&#xD;
      of the heart during periods of increased demands (such as exercise) and shortly after&#xD;
      stopping exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood flow to the heart will be measured by positron emission tomography (PET scan). The PET&#xD;
      scan is a test where a small amount of radioactive water is injected into the bloodstream and&#xD;
      pictures of the heart are taken by the special camera. This procedure allows researchers to&#xD;
      measure blood flow to heart muscle. In order to measure nutrition (metabolism) of the heart&#xD;
      muscle, researchers will use a radioactive substance similar to sugar (Fluorodeoxyglucose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study may provide important information about the activity and function of&#xD;
      heart muscle after exercise in patients suffering from coronary artery disease.&#xD;

      Exercise-induced left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities among patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease indicate myocardial ischemia due to significant coronary artery&#xD;
      narrowing. Recovery of such stress-induced wall motion abnormalities is thought to occur&#xD;
      within minutes after the termination of exercise. However, in some patients, persistent&#xD;
      contractile dysfunction has been observed up to 90 minutes into recovery. Whether persistent&#xD;
      regional wall motion abnormalities after exercise are due to stunned myocardium (prolonged&#xD;
      but reversible postischemic dysfunction despite restoration of blood flow) or persistent&#xD;
      ischemia due to coronary vasoconstriction (prolonged postischemic dysfunction due to&#xD;
      persistent reduction of regional blood flow) is not well established. It is possible that&#xD;
      persistent but reversible left ventricular dysfunction post-exercise may represent persistent&#xD;
      reduction in regional blood flow and/or altered regional metabolic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we intend to elucidate the mechanisms of prolonged but reversible&#xD;
      post-exercise left ventricular contractile dysfunction. Results of this study may provide&#xD;
      insight into the post-exercise cardiovascular physiology among patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. In addition, clinical implications can be drawn regarding patient safety and timing&#xD;
      of discharge from the exercise laboratory, as well as timing of post-exercise myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate left ventricular regional wall motion by gated blood pool tomographic&#xD;
      (SPECT) imaging at rest, during maximal exercise, 15 and 30 minutes after termination of&#xD;
      exercise. Myocardial perfusion (O-15 water) and metabolic (F-18 deoxyglucose) studies will be&#xD;
      performed utilizing positron emission tomography (PET). Absolute regional myocardial blood&#xD;
      flow (ml/min/gm) will be assessed at rest, during maximal exercise, 15 and 30 minutes&#xD;
      post-exercise along with myocardial fluorodeoxyglucose utilization 45 to 90 minutes&#xD;
      post-exercise. Patients afflicted with conditions that limit their capacity to perform an&#xD;
      adequate exercise study will undergo pharmacological stress study with dobutamine. Normal&#xD;
      subjects will also be studied in order to create a control database.&#xD;
