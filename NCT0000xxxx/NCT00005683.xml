  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct clinical interventions directed at neonatal lung disease and injury, with a focus&#xD;
      on infants having surfactant-deficiency or inactivation as a component of pathophysiology. A&#xD;
      major emphasis was on the surfactant-deficient Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) of&#xD;
      premature infants, and on acute neonatal respiratory failure in term infants with pulmonary&#xD;
      edema and potential surfactant inactivation (ARDS-related).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a subproject within a Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) in Lung Biology and&#xD;
      Diseases in Infants and Children. The clinical interventions studied had significance for&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn and for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which is the&#xD;
      chronic lung disorder of fibrosis, alveolar loss and reactive airway disease that often&#xD;
      follows pulmonary disease requiring treatment with oxygen and mechanical ventilation in the&#xD;
      newborn period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of randomized, controlled trials/studies were conducted. In the first clinical&#xD;
      study, full term infants with severe respiratory pathology where surfactant inactivation was&#xD;
      important were assigned randomly to exogenous surfactant versus control groups to determine&#xD;
      if surfactant was efficacious and safe in this kind of lung injury. In the second study,&#xD;
      infants of less than 29 weeks gestation received prophylactic exogenous surfactant, but were&#xD;
      assigned randomly to receive it immediately following birth or after initial stabilization at&#xD;
      10-15 minutes, to address a then critical current issue in surfactant therapy for RDS. In the&#xD;
      third study, infants who had moderate RDS despite exogenous surfactant therapy were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to high frequency jet or conventional ventilation groups to determine if this mode&#xD;
      of ventilation therapy would reduce barotrauma and the incidence and/or severity of&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition to these three clinical trials, another study&#xD;
      involved therapy using superoxide dismutase (SOD) along with surfactant as a multi-modal&#xD;
      approach treating premature infants with RDS and lung injury secondary to hyperoxia and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. This study depended on results of animal studies with SOD in Project&#xD;
      5. Finally, the study addressed the long term evaluation and surveillance of survival,&#xD;
      rehospitalizations, health status, pulmonary sequelae, and school performance of those&#xD;
      infants enrolled in the randomized clinical trials, as necessary for long-term outcome&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
