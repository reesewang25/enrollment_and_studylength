      The purpose of this research study is to develop a new chemo radiotherapy regimen for the&#xD;
      treatment of cancer of the head and neck for patients who have received induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy; and to determine the highest dose of Taxotere which can be safely given&#xD;
      together with radiotherapy.&#xD;

      In this investigational research study investigators are attempting to develop a new chemo&#xD;
      radiotherapy regimen in which radiotherapy and Taxotere will be combined after having&#xD;
      received induction chemotherapy. Taxotere has never been given together with radiotherapy,&#xD;
      the highest dose of Taxotere that can be safely used in this setting in unknown. Taxotere&#xD;
      will be added to radiotherapy gradually as each subsequent group of 3-5 patients gets a&#xD;
      larger dose. Taxotere doses will be increased until certain toxicities occur. This will help&#xD;
      investigators determine the best way to combine Taxotere with radiotherapy and to use that&#xD;
      knowledge to treat other patients with tumors like yours.&#xD;

             SCCHN. This excludes patients with exophytic T3N0 tumors or T1N1 lesions at the onset&#xD;
             of induction therapy. Evaluable disease during induction therapy is required.&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  PF: Cisplatin ≥ 80 mg/M2?course and FUra ≥ 1000 mg/M2/day for ≥ 4 days every ≤ 4&#xD;
                  week&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CF: Carboplatinum ≥ 300 mg/M2/course and FUra ≥1000mg/M2/day for ≥4 days for ≤ 4&#xD;
                  week&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PFL5: Cisplatin ≥ 25 mg/M2/day over 5 days, FUra ≥ 800mg/M2/day days 2-5 (4 days)&#xD;
                  and Leucovorin ≥ 500 mg/M2/day over 5 days, every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  TPF: Taxotere, Cisplatin ≥ 100 mg/M2/day over 5 days, FUra ≥ 700 mg/M2?day days&#xD;
                  2-5 (4 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
