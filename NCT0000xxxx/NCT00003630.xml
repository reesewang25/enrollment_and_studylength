      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients&#xD;
      who have advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of arsenic trioxide in adult and&#xD;
      pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the pattern of clinical adverse&#xD;
      experience of arsenic trioxide in this patient population. III. Evaluate evidence of clinical&#xD;
      responsiveness to this treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, open label study. Patients are stratified by age&#xD;
      (pediatric vs adult). Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours once daily for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days then once weekly for 5 weeks. Patients with stable or responding disease&#xD;
      receive additional courses of therapy every 8 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive escalating doses of arsenic&#xD;
      trioxide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose&#xD;
      preceding that at which 2 or more patients out of 6 experience dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients are followed for at least 1 month after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
