    <textblock>
      To evaluate laser treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) through randomized,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials. The Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) consisted of three sets&#xD;
      of randomized, controlled clinical trials. Change in best-corrected visual acuity from&#xD;
      baseline was the primary outcome for all MPS trials. Other measures of vision are evaluated&#xD;
      in each set of trials. The purpose of each is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Argon Study: To determine whether argon blue-green laser photocoagulation of leaking abnormal&#xD;
      blood vessels in choroidal neovascular membranes outside the fovea (200 to 2,500 microns from&#xD;
      the center of the foveal avascular zone [FAZ]) is of benefit in preventing or delaying loss&#xD;
      of central vision in patients with age-related (senile) macular degeneration (AMD), presumed&#xD;
      ocular histoplasmosis (POH), and idiopathic neovascular membranes (INVM). A separate trial&#xD;
      was conducted for each of the three underlying conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Krypton Study: To determine whether krypton red laser photocoagulation of choroidal&#xD;
      neovascular lesions with the posterior border 1 to 199 microns from the center of the FAZ is&#xD;
      of benefit in preventing or delaying large losses of visual acuity in patients with AMD, POH,&#xD;
      and INVM. A separate trial was conducted for each of the three underlying conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foveal Study: To determine whether laser photocoagulation is of benefit in preventing or&#xD;
      delaying further visual acuity loss in patients with new (never treated) or recurrent&#xD;
      (previously treated with laser photocoagulation) choroidal neovascularization under the&#xD;
      center of the FAZ. Two separate trials, one for each type of lesion, were carried out.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In each randomized trial conducted by the MPS Group, focal laser photocoagulation was&#xD;
      compared to observation without treatment. Patients were assigned to laser treatment or to&#xD;
      observation with equal probability. The first set of MPS randomized trials, the Argon Study,&#xD;
      focused on the effectiveness of photocoagulation with argon blue-green laser in eyes with&#xD;
      discrete extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization. The study investigators, who began&#xD;
      recruiting patients in 1979, estimated that 550 patients with AMD and 750 with POH would be&#xD;
      required. Follow-up was to continue for 5 years to determine whether argon laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation treatment could prevent or delay visual acuity loss in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initiation of the Argon Study, a new krypton red laser became available. The new&#xD;
      wavelength offered theoretical advantages over the argon laser for treating CNV that extended&#xD;
      inside the FAZ of the macula. The Krypton Study design was analogous to the Argon Study, with&#xD;
      the investigation of three underlying conditions, except that CNV was closer to the FAZ&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third set of MPS clinical trials, the Foveal Study, was designed to determine whether&#xD;
      laser photocoagulation was effective for delaying or preventing further visual acuity loss in&#xD;
      AMD patients who have subfoveal CNV. Among patients assigned to laser treatment in the Foveal&#xD;
      Study, argon laser treatment was compared with krypton red laser treatment of these lesions.&#xD;
      The investigators originally projected that about 350 patients would be required for each&#xD;
      clinical trial of the Foveal Study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Common Eligibility Criteria for the Argon, Krypton, and Foveal Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible, men and women must have been experiencing visual symptoms attributable to&#xD;
        the macular lesion, such as decreased visual acuity or Amsler grid distortion, at the time&#xD;
        of entry into the study. They also must have had visible, well-demarcated hyperfluorescence&#xD;
        characteristic of classic choroidal neovascularization on fluorescein angiography. AMD&#xD;
        patients were 50 years of age or older and had drusen visible in the macula of at least one&#xD;
        eye. POH patients were at least 18 years old and had at least one characteristic histo spot&#xD;
        in one or both eyes. INVM patients were at least 18 years old and had no evidence of AMD,&#xD;
        POH, angioid streaks, high myopia, diabetic retinopathy, or any other condition that could&#xD;
        be the cause of the neovascularization. In particular, INVM patients had neither drusen&#xD;
        greater than MPS Standard Photograph No. 1.1 nor histo spots in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria for the Argon Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient had a visible serous detachment of the sensory retina with a diffuse area of&#xD;
        leakage, discrete choroidal neovascularization outside the fovea (200-2,500 microns from&#xD;
        the center of the FAZ), and visual acuity of 20/100 or better in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria for the Krypton Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients had a neovascular lesion consisting of neovascularization and possibly blood&#xD;
        and/or pigment that extended into the FAZ. The posterior border of CNV could extend as&#xD;
        close as 1 micron to the FAZ center. Visual acuity of the study eye was 20/400 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria for the Foveal Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients with AMD were eligible for this study. Fluorescein angiography of the&#xD;
        eligible eye had to show evidence of a leaking choroidal neovascular membrane, some part of&#xD;
        which extended under the center of the FAZ, or a neovascular lesion consisting of an old&#xD;
        laser treatment scar and contiguous leaking neovascularization within 150 microns of the&#xD;
        center of the FAZ. New, never-treated subfoveal lesions were less than four disc areas in&#xD;
        size. Recurrent lesions were less than six disc areas in size, including the old treatment&#xD;
        scar and new neovascularization. Best-corrected visual acuity was no better than 20/40 and&#xD;
        no worse than 20/320.&#xD;
