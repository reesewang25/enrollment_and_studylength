  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the possible relationship between silicone implants or injections and&#xD;
      the connective tissue diseases scleroderma and myositis. It will explore whether certain&#xD;
      factors in the blood or the immune system or other factors are involved in the development of&#xD;
      these diseases following silicone implantation or injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women 18 years of age and older who meet the following criteria may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1-Patients who have had silicone implants or injections and who later developed&#xD;
      scleroderma or myositis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2-Patients with scleroderma or myositis who have not had silicone implants or&#xD;
      injections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3-Healthy volunteers who have had silicone implants or injections and did not develop&#xD;
      symptoms or other medical features of connective tissue disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a thorough history and physical examination, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      chest X-ray and lung function tests. In addition, patients will complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      about their procedure (including information such as the types of implanted devices and&#xD;
      injections, reason for the procedure, post-operative complications, other illnesses or&#xD;
      medical conditions present before and after the procedure, etc.).&#xD;

      This multicenter study will attempt to determine the epidemiologic, clinical, serologic and&#xD;
      immunogenetic factors associated with patients who develop scleroderma/systemic sclerosis&#xD;
      after silicone prosthesis implantation or silicone injection. This will be accomplished by&#xD;
      comparing these patients to groups of appropriately matched patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      scleroderma/systemic sclerosis without silicone exposure, and appropriately matched&#xD;
      volunteers who have received similar silicone implants or injections and have not developed&#xD;
      symptoms, physical examination findings, or laboratory abnormalities associated with&#xD;
      autoimmune/connective tissue diseases. Patient and physician questionnaires will be&#xD;
      self-administered, and will collect data regarding: the number and types of implanted&#xD;
      silicone devices or injections; the indications for and nature of the surgical procedures;&#xD;
      peri- and post-operative complications; initial and subsequent clinical presentations; and&#xD;
      therapy and clinical course of the patients. Routine clinical tests and immunologic&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations will be performed. Also, studies will be conducted on the proportion&#xD;
      of circulating activated lymphocytes and levels of soluble mediators of inflammation&#xD;
      (cytokines, sIL-2R, sCD4, sCD8, TNF), the types of HLA and T cell receptor genes present in&#xD;
      the patients, and the presence and titers of anti-silicone antibodies and autoantibodies.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        For all groups: Age greater than 18 years; ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have severe medical disease requiring intensive care or any other conditions in&#xD;
        which the drawing of the amount of blood required for research purposes is not deemed&#xD;
        medically appropriate by the treating physician or the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Group 1: Patients who have had silicon prostheses, or silicone injection, who&#xD;
        subsequently developed scleroderma/systemic sclerosis or myositis as defined by criteria&#xD;
        established by the American College of Rheumatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Group 2: Patients with idiopathic scleroderma/systemic sclerosis or myositis as defined&#xD;
        by criteria established by the American Collage of Rheumatology, without silicone&#xD;
        implantation or injection, age-, sex-, and race-matched to Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 3: Patients who have had silicone prostheses or silicone injection, age-, sex-, race-&#xD;
        and silicone exposure-matched to patients in Group 1, who have not developed chronic&#xD;
        symptoms, physical findings, or laboratory abnormalities associated with autoimmune or&#xD;
        connective tissue diseases.&#xD;
