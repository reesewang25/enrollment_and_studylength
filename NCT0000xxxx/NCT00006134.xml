      OBJECTIVES: I. Continue yearly ascertainment visits of all patients of the established Lupus&#xD;
      in Minority Populations: Nature vs Nurture (LUMINA) study cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Recruit into the LUMINA cohort newly diagnosed patients with systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      (SLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the impact of additional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC&#xD;
      genetic factors not previously examined, specifically tumor necrosis factor, mannose binding&#xD;
      protein, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and bcl-2, on the course and outcome of SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Refine the assessment of those clinical and behavioral-cultural factors found to be&#xD;
      important predictors of disease activity, damage, and functioning, thus far in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the relationships among disease activity, disease damage, and physical and&#xD;
      mental functioning in these patients as the SLE progresses and the factors that predict them.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a parallel, follow up study of a natural history study. Patients&#xD;
      are stratified according to ethnicity (Caucasian vs African-American vs Hispanic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are examined at baseline and then every 6 months thereafter in order to determine&#xD;
      the relative impact of genetic, sociodemographic, and behavioral-cultural factors on disease&#xD;
      outcome. Patients are assessed for the following outcome variables: disease activity by the&#xD;
      Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM), disease damage by the Systemic Lupus International&#xD;
      Collaborative Clinics Damage Index (SDI), and physical and mental functioning by the Medical&#xD;
      Outcomes Study 36 Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients are also assessed for&#xD;
      independent variables belonging to the following domains: socioeconomic-demographic,&#xD;
      clinical, immunogenetic, and behavioral-cultural. Patients undergo genetic analysis utilizing&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis to further study the immunogenetic domain and&#xD;
      genetic markers that may be related to disease. Specifically, patients' blood is analyzed for&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor beta, mannose binding protein,&#xD;
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and bcl-2.&#xD;
