      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease. We propose to study inflammatory changes in the&#xD;
      lungs of subjects with atopic asthma of different severity in vivo using positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). It has been shown that the&#xD;
      uptake of FDG as detected by PET scanning correlates with inflammation in animal models as&#xD;
      well as in human disease processes such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and abscess formation.&#xD;
      In addition, it has been shown that the inflammation associated with allergen challenge in&#xD;
      patients with atopic asthma can be visualized using PET scanning with FDG. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that the degree of FDG-uptake as a measure of inflammation correlates with the severity of&#xD;
      asthma as determined by pulmonary function tests and clinical signs and symptoms. In&#xD;
      addition, information about the spatial distribution of the inflammatory changes will be&#xD;
      obtained. To compare the characteristics of the inflammation in asthma with non-asthmatic&#xD;
      inflammation of the lung, the images obtained in asthmatic subjects will be compared with&#xD;
      images from subjects who have inflammatory changes of the lung caused by Wegener's&#xD;
      granulomatosis. Subjects with atopic asthma and non-atopic control subjects will be selected&#xD;
      from the community and, if eligible for the study, undergo skin testing against common&#xD;
      allergens and pulmonary function testing. Subjects with Wegener's granulomatosis will be&#xD;
      selected from a large group of subjects followed with this disease at NIAID. PET scanning&#xD;
      with FDG will be used to measure inflammation in the PET scanning facility at the Clinical&#xD;
      Center of the NIH and the results of the scanning will be correlated with the severity of the&#xD;
      disease. We expect that for the first time this methodology will permit an objective measure&#xD;
      of the basic pathogenic process, the allergic inflammation, in patients with atopic asthma.&#xD;
      Using this methodology it will be possible to study the efficacy of currently available&#xD;
      therapies for allergic inflammation. In addition, this methodology will provide an extremely&#xD;
      useful tool for the development of new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of asthma.&#xD;
