      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators extended work they had done in modeling the health benefit of reducing risk&#xD;
      factors for cardiovascular disease. Their new model incorporating risks of importance in the&#xD;
      elderly, including cerebrovascular disease, estimated both morbidity and mortality averted by&#xD;
      risk reduction, and estimated the costs and risks of the interventions used to modify risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model was designed for the counseling of elderly individuals free of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, and evaluated strategies for remaining disease free. It was implemented as software&#xD;
      running on personal computers, and marketed to physicians and other health professionals who&#xD;
      advised the elderly on medical issues. Accompanying documentation was also developed to&#xD;
      explain the assumptions and non-quantifiable aspects of the decision to adopt major lifestyle&#xD;
      changes to reduce risk.&#xD;
