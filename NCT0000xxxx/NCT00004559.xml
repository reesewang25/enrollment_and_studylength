  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the dietary N-3 class of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) provided in the&#xD;
      diet largely from marine fish oils would prevent fatal ventricular tachycardia (VT) or&#xD;
      ventricular fibrillation (VF).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden death is a common manifestation of ischemic heart disease and therefore of great&#xD;
      public health concern. Unfortunately several promising antiarrhythmic drugs proved not to be&#xD;
      effective in preventing sudden deaths. This project would test whether a relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive and presumably innocuous therapy, fish oil supplements, can prevent&#xD;
      life-threatening arrhythmias. There is ample basic evidence that n-3 fatty acids contained in&#xD;
      fish oil supplements may suppress arrhythmias, and a clinical trial seems warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind. Patients were randomized to 4&#xD;
      grams per day of a PUFA fish oil supplement versus an olive oil placebo. The number of&#xD;
      therapeutic discharges were recorded from the ICDs and then confirmed from the recorded&#xD;
      electrocardiogram strips with the kinds of arrhythmias which had induced the ICD response.&#xD;
      The primary end point, time to first ICD event for ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation&#xD;
      (VT or VF) confirmed by stored electrograms or death from any cause, was analyzed by&#xD;
      intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
