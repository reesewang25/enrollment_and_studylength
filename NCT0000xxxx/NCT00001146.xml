  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids, compounds found in plants&#xD;
      and fish, in treating bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have indicated that omega-3 fatty acids may be effective in treating mood&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, one investigator has shown a correlation between the prevalence of major&#xD;
      depression and the amount of fish consumed per capita worldwide. Others have found decreased&#xD;
      amounts of EPA (one of the active ingredients in omega-3 fatty acids) in the red blood cells&#xD;
      of patients with major depression. And a recent small study of patients with bipolar illness&#xD;
      indicated that omega-3 fatty acids prevented relapses, especially of depression, in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with bipolar disorder who are not benefiting satisfactorily on their current&#xD;
      medications are eligible to participate in this study. Candidates will be screened with a&#xD;
      psychiatric evaluation, routine blood tests, a urine test and other tests needed to monitor&#xD;
      medications. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will&#xD;
      receive 6 grams of omega-3 fatty acid every day for 16 weeks; the second will receive a&#xD;
      placebo (inactive capsule). In addition, patients in both groups will continue to take their&#xD;
      previous medications. Every 2 weeks, all patients will have their vital signs checked and be&#xD;
      evaluated for side effects and mood changes. At the end of the 16-week study period, all&#xD;
      patients will be given the opportunity to continue in the study for another 8 months and&#xD;
      receive active drug (omega-3 fatty acid). Patients who continue will be evaluated once a&#xD;
      month and will have blood drawn on the last visit for routine tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic ethyl esters (EPA) - in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids are long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids found in plant and marine sources. There&#xD;
      are preliminary data to suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be efficacious in the treatment&#xD;
      of mood disorders. Patients in our bipolar outpatient clinic will be at one of the five NIMH&#xD;
      - Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network (the &quot;Network&quot;) sites participating in this project.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to 6 grams per day of omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids or placebo (paraffin capsules) as an &quot;add-on&quot; to ongoing treatment with mood&#xD;
      stabilizing medication(s) which have proven unsatisfactorily effective within therapeutic&#xD;
      range(s) or at maximum tolerated dose(s). The double-blind trial will continue for 4 months&#xD;
      duration. Patients will then be offered the option of entering an eight month, open-label&#xD;
      trial of omega-3 fatty acid. The hypothesis of this study is that omega-3 polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids in the form of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) acting on some of the same signal&#xD;
      transduction mechanisms as the mood stabilizers will be beneficial in breakthrough&#xD;
      depression, mania and cycling of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
