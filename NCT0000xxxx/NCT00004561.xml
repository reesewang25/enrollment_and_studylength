      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial hypertension affects over 50 million Americans. While drug treatment is effective,&#xD;
      exercise would be safer, might be cheaper, and would bring added health benefits if it could&#xD;
      replace drugs in controlling hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, controlled trial. Known hypertensives (n=162) whose diastolic blood pressures&#xD;
      rose to between 90 and 104 within four months of discontinuing medication under careful&#xD;
      observation had their pressures controlled with enalapril. Oxygen consumption (V02) peak was&#xD;
      measured during cycle ergometry. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to 18 months&#xD;
      participation in one of three groups: 1) high intensity endurance training (35 minutes three&#xD;
      times/week at heart rate at 70-85 percent of V02 peak), 2) moderate intensity endurance&#xD;
      training (35 minutes three times/week at heart rate of 50-70 of V02 peak), and 3) contact&#xD;
      control. Enalapril was forward or back titrated or discontinued to maintain a normal blood&#xD;
      pressure. After 12 months participation, medication was withdrawn under careful supervision&#xD;
      from all subjects still taking it. The trial tested the hypotheses that: 1) a greater number&#xD;
      of subjects undergoing either or both of the two 18 month exercise training programs would be&#xD;
      able to stop anti-hypertensive medication than non-exercising controls, 2) moderate and high&#xD;
      intensity endurance training were equally effective in replacing drugs in the treatment of&#xD;
      mild essential hypertension, and 3) subjects that were successful at withdrawing&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive medication would have: greater improvements in V02 peak, better initial&#xD;
      psychological status or greater improvements in psychological status, and greater compliance&#xD;
      with the exercise training program.&#xD;
