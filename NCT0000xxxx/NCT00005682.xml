      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aplastic anemia, a form of bone marrow failure, is a disease of largely unknown cause, except&#xD;
      for the rare situations involving high doses of radiation. Many agents have been mentioned in&#xD;
      case reports to be associated with the development of aplastic anemia and include drugs,&#xD;
      chemicals, pesticides, radiation, and viral infection. Of these, chloramphenicol,&#xD;
      phenylbutazone, and insecticides are most frequently reported. In the United States and other&#xD;
      developed countries the disease prevalence is so low that too few cases occur to make an&#xD;
      epidemiological study in a single city logistically feasible. The Bangkok hospitalization&#xD;
      rate for aplastic anemia was sufficient to conduct a case-control study. Also, a study&#xD;
      conducted in this locale provided information on drugs and chemicals not commonly used in&#xD;
      developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All aplastic anemia cases in metropolitan Bangkok were located and verified in the forty&#xD;
      hospitals that agreed to participate in the study. Incidence rates were calculated by age&#xD;
      group and sex. In the case-control study, interviews were used to obtain comprehensive&#xD;
      histories of drug, chemical, pesticide, radiation, viral infections, and other exposures,&#xD;
      along with relevant demographic and medical history information in order to examine the&#xD;
      association between and test hypotheses regarding suspected hazards and to estimate the risks&#xD;
      of developing aplastic anemia. The basic epidemiologic features of aplastic anemia were&#xD;
      described by characterizing these patients in terms of standard demographic variables, age,&#xD;
      race, sex, and medical history. The degree of association between viral hepatitis and the&#xD;
      development of aplastic anemia was estimated.&#xD;
