  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify patients who have early HIV infection. Patients who&#xD;
      have been infected with HIV recently may develop flu-like symptoms within 3 to 8 weeks. Those&#xD;
      who go to the hospital emergency room for these symptoms and who may have been exposed to HIV&#xD;
      recently will be given a questionnaire and the opportunity to be tested for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people develop flu-like symptoms shortly after becoming infected with HIV, and many of&#xD;
      these people go to a hospital emergency room for treatment. However, most doctors do not&#xD;
      think of testing people with flu-like symptoms for HIV. This study will look at a plan to&#xD;
      change this because it is very important to identify patients who have early HIV infection.&#xD;
      Viral load (level of HIV in the blood) is very high during early HIV infection, and it is&#xD;
      easy to spread HIV to others during this period. Patients who learn they are HIV-positive can&#xD;
      stop risky behavior that might spread HIV to other people. Also, patients who find out early&#xD;
      that they are HIV positive are able to begin anti-HIV treatment sooner, slowing the disease.&#xD;

      Early identification of HIV infection is an important factor in preventing the spread of HIV.&#xD;
      It is hoped that patients who learn their HIV status will decrease behavior that may lead to&#xD;
      further transmission of HIV. Infectiousness of HIV is high during PHI, with some of the&#xD;
      highest viral loads seen shortly after infection. Treatment for HIV infection now typically&#xD;
      begins after identification of infection, but treatment during PHI may positively affect the&#xD;
      long-term outcome of the disease. The majority of patients present with flu-like symptoms&#xD;
      during PHI. Many seek medical attention, often in an ED setting, but rarely is the diagnosis&#xD;
      of HIV considered. Specific screening efforts, therefore, are needed to identify infected&#xD;
      individuals before standard ELISA testing would detect infection. This study attempts to&#xD;
      demonstrate that administration of a questionnaire to a targeted population presenting&#xD;
      symptomatically with viral syndrome in an inner city ED will result in increased screening&#xD;
      for HIV and identification of patients with PHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to the UCSD ED with viral syndromes are approached by staff and asked to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire regarding possible recent HIV exposure. Patients with risk for&#xD;
      recent HIV infection are offered participation in this study. Pre-test counseling includes a&#xD;
      review of: (1) the risk of discrimination if the test is positive, (2) the implications of a&#xD;
      positive test upon the health of the patient and that of their sexual or needle-use partners,&#xD;
      and (3) the possibility that this test, like any laboratory test, could be wrong. Consenting&#xD;
      patients have blood drawn for HIV RNA testing and for possible HIV p24 antigen confirmatory&#xD;
      test. Blood is labeled with a unique identifying number and not by name. When results become&#xD;
      available, patients go the UCSD Treatment Center to learn the results and for post-test&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;
