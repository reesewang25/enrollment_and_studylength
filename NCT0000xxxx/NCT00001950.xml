  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly believed that objects in the world can be categorized in at least three&#xD;
      different ways or levels. The three levels are basic, superordinate, and subordinate.&#xD;
      Previously it was believed that basic categorization presents a cognitive (mental) advantage&#xD;
      to children's development. However, recent studies on superordinate categorization has&#xD;
      challenged this belief.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt;TAB&gt;Items in superordinate are grouped according to functional purpose, even though&#xD;
           they may not share any similarities in how they look (perception). For instance, desks,&#xD;
           chairs, and beds do not appear similar but they can be group together in the&#xD;
           superordinate category of furniture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &lt;TAB&gt;Items in basic categorization share similarities in function and in perception. For&#xD;
           instance, chairs can be considered as a basic category. Chairs can share functional and&#xD;
           perceptual similarities with many kinds of chairs but are readily distinguished from&#xD;
           other types of furniture like beds or desks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &lt;TAB&gt;Subordinate categories are subsets of basic categories. For instance, kitchen&#xD;
           chairs, desk chairs, and high chairs, are all within the basic category of chairs. Each&#xD;
           one is very similar in it's function to the others but is definitely discriminable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was developed to investigate the development of categorization at all three levels&#xD;
      by using a design in which children between the ages of 1 and 3 years are tested for&#xD;
      categorization at all three levels with sets of objects from the same domain (such as vehicle&#xD;
      or fruit). Researchers plan to chart when infants develop categorization at the basic,&#xD;
      subordinate, and superordinate levels over the two-year period.&lt;TAB&gt;...&#xD;

      The major objective of this research is to better understand the functional significance of&#xD;
      object categorization in early development. The proposed work is designed to examine the&#xD;
      emergence of organization in toddlers internal representations of real-world categories such&#xD;
      as furniture and fruit. Representation, in this capacity, refers simply to stored information&#xD;
      that can influence later behavior. Categorization refers to the treatment of discriminable as&#xD;
      equivalent in some way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even young infants appear capable of categorizing diverse sets of discriminable patterns and&#xD;
      objects, and can form internal representations of such bounded collections. Much less is&#xD;
      known, however, about changes leading from this basic capacity to the highly structured&#xD;
      concepts that are characteristics of children s and adults category knowledge. The present&#xD;
      research is designed to characterize the course of these changes between infancy and&#xD;
      childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research strategy to be used consists of analyzing toddlers examination and&#xD;
      manipulation of familiar objects that are similar within adult-defined categories than&#xD;
      between such categories. The organization and temporal structure of children s actions on the&#xD;
      objects will be coded and analyzed to infer the similarity relations that are perceived among&#xD;
      of each stimulus set.&#xD;
