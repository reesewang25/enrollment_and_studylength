  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a new drug combination for treating&#xD;
      patients with severe aplastic anemia. Patients with aplastic anemia produce too few blood&#xD;
      cells, causing fatigue, easy bruising and bleeding, and susceptibility to infections. In many&#xD;
      cases, the very low blood counts result from an autoimmune process-that is, the patient's own&#xD;
      immune system suppresses production of blood cells by the bone marrow. Although&#xD;
      immune-suppressing drugs, such as cyclosporine, can restore normal cell counts, many patients&#xD;
      have disease relapses. These patients require long-term therapy with cyclosporine, which can&#xD;
      cause harmful side effects. This study will examine whether a lower dose of cyclosporine&#xD;
      given together with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can maintain blood counts as effectively as&#xD;
      full-dose cyclosporine treatment, and whether MMF alone can reduce the chances of future&#xD;
      relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 4 years of age and older with severe aplastic anemia who have relapsed after immune&#xD;
      suppressing therapy may be eligible for this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either standard cyclosporine therapy or experimental therapy with cyclosporine and&#xD;
      MMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving standard cyclosporine therapy will receive a full dose of the drug for at&#xD;
      least 3 months. Those taking both cyclosporine and MMF will take MMF plus half-dose&#xD;
      cyclosporine for 3 months and continue MMF for an additional 6 months. Both drugs are taken&#xD;
      twice a day by mouth. All patients will have about 120 milliliters (4 ounces) of blood drawn&#xD;
      at the beginning of the study to evaluate immune system activity and bone marrow function,&#xD;
      and to look for genetic material of certain viruses. Bone marrow aspirations and biopsies&#xD;
      will be done at the beginning of the study, and at 6 and 12 months. For these tests, the area&#xD;
      of the hip is anesthetized and a special needle is used to draw bone marrow from the hipbone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's local doctor will be asked to do blood tests for chemistries, liver function&#xD;
      and cyclosporine levels weekly for the first month and then every other week. Patients will&#xD;
      return to NIH for evaluations 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment and then once a year. About&#xD;
      100 ml (7 tablespoons) of blood will be drawn at each visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aplastic anemia is characterized by trilineage hematopoietic failure with an apparently empty&#xD;
      bone marrow. While the precise mechanism of disease has yet to be elucidated, much evidence&#xD;
      indicates an immunologically mediated pathophysiology. Clinical trials have shown that&#xD;
      approximately 75-80% of patients who are treated with immunosuppressive drugs, especially the&#xD;
      combination of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA), demonstrate a return of&#xD;
      hematopoieses and improved blood counts. This therapy now is considered standard care for the&#xD;
      treatment of aplastic anemia in all patients who lack a histocompatibility antigen-matched&#xD;
      sibling donor and also in older patients regardless of donor status. However, with longer&#xD;
      length of evaluation of patients after initial treatment, it is becoming increasingly clear&#xD;
      that a substantial proportion will suffer relapse of pancytopenia. ATG and CSA do not appear&#xD;
      to cure the disease in these patients but only disrupt a chronic autoimmune process. Recent&#xD;
      data from our own series of patients treated with ATG and CSA, and studies of European&#xD;
      patients who are treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) and CSA, indicate that&#xD;
      approximately 1/3 of responding patients will relapse and require treatment within 1-2 years&#xD;
      of discontinuation of CSA. About 15% of patients become dependent on continued CSA&#xD;
      administration in order to maintain blood counts. Chronic CSA toxicities include increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to infections, hypertension, and irreversible renal damage, as well as&#xD;
      hypertrichosis, hyperaesthesias, gingival hyperplasia, headaches, tremors, and other&#xD;
      troubling complaints; there is also a possible increased risk of late malignant diseases.&#xD;
      Therefore, a major priority in clinical research in aplastic anemia is the development of&#xD;
      strategies to produce more durable responses, as well as to identify immunosuppressive agents&#xD;
      that can be used as effectively and with fewer side affects than cyclosporine. Mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil (MMF) is a novel immunosuppressive drug with proven efficacy in the treatment of&#xD;
      graft rejection in renal transplantation. MMF has a different toxicity profile from&#xD;
      cyclosporine, and specifically does not damage the kidneys. In this study, we will randomize&#xD;
      patients who are judged to have relapsed to receive either standard treatment with full dose&#xD;
      cyclosporine or half dose cyclosporine combined with MMF. We anticipate that the combination&#xD;
      of cyclosporine with MMF will be as effective as conventional high dose cyclosporine for the&#xD;
      purpose of treating relapse of aplastic anemia and would provide a less toxic regimen for&#xD;
      long-term treatment of this disease.&#xD;
