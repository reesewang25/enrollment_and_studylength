  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well antibiotics work in reducing chronic fatigue&#xD;
      symptoms, such as tiredness, in patients that were treated for Lyme Disease. Fatigue is a&#xD;
      common symptom of Lyme Disease. When fatigue does not improve after treatment, patients are&#xD;
      considered to have Post Lyme Syndrome (PLS). The chronic fatigue seen in these patients&#xD;
      appears to be related to the initial infection which causes Lyme Disease. It is believed, but&#xD;
      not proven, that treatment with antibiotics may be effective in relieving chronic fatigue in&#xD;
      PLS patients.&#xD;

      You will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive either antibiotics or a&#xD;
      placebo (sugar pill). Neither you nor your doctor will know which you are receiving. You will&#xD;
      learn to give yourself the injection, and you will remain on your study drug for 28 days. A&#xD;
      home health care nurse will visit you twice a week to check the injection site, and at weeks&#xD;
      1 and 3 the nurse will draw blood for laboratory tests. At months 1 and 6, you will be&#xD;
      examined to see if you have fewer chronic fatigue symptoms after the antibiotics. This will&#xD;
      include a fatigue questionnaire, a test of your mental processing speed, and a test of your&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
