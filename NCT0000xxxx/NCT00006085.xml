      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CP-609,754 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of CP-609,754 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the predictability,&#xD;
      duration, intensity, onset, reversibility, and dose relationship of any observed toxicities&#xD;
      in these patients when treated with this regimen. III. Determine any preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      antitumor activity of this treatment as assessed by response rate and time to disease&#xD;
      progression in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral CP-609,754 1-2 times daily.&#xD;
      Treatment continues every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CP-609,754 until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that&#xD;
      at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed at 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 44-56 patients will be accrued for this study within 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
