      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of an initiative &quot;Interventions to Improve Asthma Management and&#xD;
      Prevention at School&quot;. The Broad Agency Announcement was released in June, 1994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used a randomized intervention trial to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive&#xD;
      school-based asthma program to increase linkages with primary care physicians, to increase&#xD;
      self-management activities, and to reduce morbidity associated with asthma. The study used a&#xD;
      nested design in which the schools were the unit of design, allocation, and analysis. Effects&#xD;
      were measured from aggregate data about students and data from school measures to control&#xD;
      asthma. There were three components to the intervention. First, case finding for asthma&#xD;
      through screening in both intervention and control schools. Second, a linkage management&#xD;
      system that connected the child with a source of primary care and enhanced communication&#xD;
      among the school nurse, the primary care physician, and parents. Third, the development and&#xD;
      implementation of interactive multimedia and decision support system techniques to tailor&#xD;
      individualized learning opportunities for children with asthma. The interventions occurred in&#xD;
      the school setting and included tailored feedback for children, teachers, nurses, primary&#xD;
      care providers, and the family. Assessments were made of the potential for diffusion of the&#xD;
      components to target audiences.&#xD;
