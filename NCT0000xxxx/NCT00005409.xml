      To study further the association between blood pressure mortality among those who&#xD;
      participated in both the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) screen and the&#xD;
      East Boston Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies in the Elderly (EPESE) study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In middle-age, level of blood pressure (BP) is a strong and independent predictor of both&#xD;
      total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. However, among the elderly, recent&#xD;
      short-term observational studies, including the East Boston Established Populations for&#xD;
      Epidemiologic Studies in the Elderly (EPESE), have raised the possibility of a J-shaped&#xD;
      curve. In a study of short-term mortality, low blood pressures were positively associated&#xD;
      with total and cardiovascular disease mortality. However, a further analysis confined to the&#xD;
      2079 (68 percent) of this cohort who were also screened nine years previously for the&#xD;
      Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program showed the more conventional positive linear&#xD;
      relationship between systolic blood pressure, and no association between diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and mortality. The observations of higher short-term total and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease mortality at lower blood pressure levels among the elderly could have reflected a&#xD;
      particular susceptibility to deleterious consequences of drug therapy for high blood&#xD;
      pressure. Alternatively, such a finding might have been artifactual, due to survival bias or&#xD;
      confounding by co-morbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linking data from the HDFP and the EPESE studies, the investigators examined change in blood&#xD;
      pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and mortality over a 15-year period. With regard&#xD;
      to the association between lower blood pressure and increased mortality, they determined&#xD;
      whether the relationship previously observed reflected a fall from normotensive levels as&#xD;
      opposed to a consistently low blood pressure. With regard to the upper end of the mortality&#xD;
      curve, they assessed the effect of antihypertensive drug treatment on mortality as compared&#xD;
      to those with untreated hypertension. The latter question had particular public health&#xD;
      significance because questions remained about the risk-to-benefit ratio of antihypertensive&#xD;
      drug treatment in this age group. Furthermore, they also described changes in blood pressure&#xD;
      in this population and medication usage patterns over time and correlated type of medication&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
