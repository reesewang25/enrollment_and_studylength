  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of an HIV vaccine (Remune) on the&#xD;
      immune system. This study involves patients who have received at least 60 weeks of anti-HIV&#xD;
      therapy, either alone or in combination with IL-2, while enrolled in ACTG 328.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remune is an experimental HIV vaccine. To see how the body's immune system reacts, this&#xD;
      vaccine will be given with 1 to 3 other vaccines, and skin tests will monitor the body's&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proliferative responses to HIV antigens are either absent or of small magnitude in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients, even in the early stages of infection when vigorous proliferative&#xD;
      responses to recall antigens are still seen. Remune consists of an inactivated,&#xD;
      gp120-depleted virus intended to stimulate HIV-specific immune responses. Remune has been&#xD;
      reported to increase lymphocyte proliferative responses to HIV antigens in patients with high&#xD;
      CD4 cell counts. Many other T-cell-dependent responses are also impaired in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients, such as after vaccination with hepatitis A or B vaccine. In this study, patients&#xD;
      with moderately advanced HIV disease who have already received 52 weeks of either HAART or&#xD;
      HAART plus IL-2 are vaccinated with Remune and a control recall immunogen, tetanus toxoid&#xD;
      (TT), to evaluate whether these patients can develop new CD4 T-cell and CD8 T-cell responses&#xD;
      to HIV-related antigens. The antibody response to hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations&#xD;
      also will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty patients are enrolled in this substudy; 17 from the HAART only arm (Arm I of ACTG 328)&#xD;
      and 33 from the HAART plus either CIV or subcutaneous IL-2 arms (Arms II and III of ACTG&#xD;
      328). All patients are vaccinated 3 times with Remune and twice with TT. If patients are&#xD;
      hepatitis A total antibody negative, they receive hepatitis A vaccine twice. Additionally, if&#xD;
      patients are hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody and surface&#xD;
      antibody negative, they receive hepatitis B vaccine 3 times. Patients who are negative for&#xD;
      all hepatitis markers receive hepatitis A and B vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 0 of A5046s begins at or after Week 64 of ACTG 328 (for patients in the HAART-only arm)&#xD;
      or 4 weeks after the initiation of the seventh or any subsequent IL-2 cycle of ACTG 328 (for&#xD;
      patients in any of the IL-2-containing arms). [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99: Patients can be&#xD;
      screened through Week 124 of ACTG 328.] Patients receive Remune at Weeks 0, 8, and 16 and TT&#xD;
      at Weeks 0 and 8. Hepatitis A and/or B vaccines are also given at these times, if indicated.&#xD;
      Blood and skin tests are performed at Weeks 0, 8, 16, and 24 to measure immune response and&#xD;
      lymphocyte proliferative responses.&#xD;
