      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-two (42) elementary schools in urban Baltimore and Washington, DC, served as&#xD;
      recruitment sites and approximately 300 students with moderate to severe asthma were&#xD;
      enrolled. All participants enrolled in the A+ Asthma Program. Primary care practitioners of&#xD;
      these students were randomized to a minimal contact program or to the A+ asthma physician&#xD;
      partnership. They were offered a menu of educational offerings to improve their knowledge and&#xD;
      skills. The primary outcome measure was emergency care use. Secondary measures included&#xD;
      physician practices, hospitalization, health care utilization, restricted activities,&#xD;
      medication use, school absences and coping skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
