  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An echocardiogram is an ultrasound technique used to gather information about the heart.&#xD;
      Standard echocardiograms create images of the heart in two dimensions, thereby named 2D&#xD;
      (two-dimensional) echocardiography. A new technique has been developed allowing images to be&#xD;
      taken of the heart in three dimensions (real time 3D echocardiography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3D echocardiogram uses high frequency sound waves to see and record the movement and&#xD;
      function of the heart muscle. The echocardiogram is taken by placing an instrument called a&#xD;
      transducer against the chest wall over the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients will undergo a dobutamine stress echocardiogram. Dobutamine is drug&#xD;
      that causes the heart to beat stronger and faster, similar to how it acts when exercising.&#xD;
      Dobutamine allows researchers to tell if the heart is suffering from a lack of oxygen during&#xD;
      exercise or other forms of stress, or if it is permanently damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether stress 3D echocardiography is feasible and&#xD;
      accurate in the detection of heart disease (coronary artery disease). Results of the 3D&#xD;
      echocardiogram will be compared to results from standard 2D echocardiograms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stress echocardiography has become a valuable technique for the non-invasive detection of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. Its accuracy has been shown to be superior to that of the exercise&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and comparable to that of myocardial perfusion imaging. The adequacy of&#xD;
      stress echocardiography with conventional two-dimensional imaging, however, is highly&#xD;
      dependent on operator expertise. Further, interpretation of test results is subjective and&#xD;
      qualitative, and is based on analysis of wall motion after arbitrary segmentation of the left&#xD;
      ventricle. Real time 3-dimensional (RT3D) echocardiography is a new technique that permits&#xD;
      the unrestricted assessment of left ventricular wall motion and function in a single cardiac&#xD;
      beat without ECG or respiratory gating. We hypothesize that RT3D echocardiography will have&#xD;
      similar or greater accuracy for the detection of wall motion abnormalities compared to the&#xD;
      conventional two-dimensional examination. We therefore propose to acquire RT3D&#xD;
      echocardiographic images in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease who&#xD;
      undergo stress echocardiography. We will correlate these results with findings from coronary&#xD;
      angiography and compare the ability of RT3D echocardiography to detect coronary artery&#xD;
      disease with that of the conventional two-dimensional exam.&#xD;

        Patients older than 18 years of age with known or suspected coronary artery disease who&#xD;
