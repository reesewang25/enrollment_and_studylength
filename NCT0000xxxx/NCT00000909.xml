  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of giving interleukin-2&#xD;
      (IL-2) alone to HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts greater than 350 cells/mm3 who do&#xD;
      not wish to receive anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy. This study will also determine if IL-2&#xD;
      given alone can increase CD4 cell counts or decrease the level of HIV in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2 (a protein found in the blood that helps boost the immune system) can result in&#xD;
      increases in CD4 cell count (immune system cells that fight infection). IL-2 is normally&#xD;
      given in combination with antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV infection; however, some HIV&#xD;
      patients do not wish to take antiretrovirals. This study asks if it is safe and effective to&#xD;
      take IL-2 alone to treat HIV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that interleukin-2, when given under the skin, results in CD4+&#xD;
      cell count increases, and may impact upon disease progression. A Phase III trial is the next&#xD;
      step in the development of these efficacy trials. One question, however, has not been&#xD;
      addressed in previous IL-2 studies: whether it is both safe and reasonable to allow&#xD;
      prospective IL-2 recipients the autonomy of choosing whether or not to take antiretrovirals&#xD;
      in addition to their cytokine therapy. This trial addresses that concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open-label study, 36 patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups of 12&#xD;
      patients each:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: IL-2 every 12 hours for 5 days every 8 weeks. Group II: IL-2 every 12 hours for 5&#xD;
      days every 8 weeks (higher IL-2 dose). Group III: Control group receiving no therapy.&#xD;
      Patients must complete a minimum of 3 8-week cycles of treatment. Twelve patients are&#xD;
      randomized to each arm. Following study completion, Group I and II patients may elect to&#xD;
      continue receiving IL-2 during follow-up or as part of an additional protocol based on the&#xD;
      results of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/12/99: Patients who have received study medication and/or routine&#xD;
      protocol visits and procedures for at least 6 months with acceptable compliance are eligible&#xD;
      for continued follow-up in an extension phase. The extension phase will continue for at least&#xD;
      1 year from the date when the last patient has been enrolled in the extension phase. Patients&#xD;
      originally randomized to IL-2 may continue to receive IL-2 during the extension period, with&#xD;
      IL-2 therapy guided on an individual basis. Patients originally randomized to no therapy may&#xD;
      continue to receive no therapy during the extension phase.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/11/00:&#xD;
      Patients demonstrating acceptable compliance with routine visits and procedures during the&#xD;
      initial treatment phase and/or extension phase may participate in the long-term follow-up&#xD;
      phase which requires follow-up visits at least every 4 months for approximately 5 years.&#xD;
      Patients originally randomized to Group 1 or 2 may continue to receive IL-2, with IL-2&#xD;
      therapy guided on an individual basis, during the long-term follow-up phase. Patients&#xD;
      originally randomized to Group 3 may continue to receive no therapy during the long-term&#xD;
      follow-up phase.]&#xD;
