  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and bioavailability of zidovudine (AZT) given&#xD;
      to patients with HIV infection and chronic liver disease. The specific aim of the study is to&#xD;
      provide data permitting the development of guidelines for use of AZT in patients with mild,&#xD;
      moderate, or severe liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZT is the only antiviral agent that has been shown to be effective in patients with severe&#xD;
      HIV infection. However, AZT is largely eliminated from the body through a biochemical&#xD;
      reaction that takes place in the liver, and it is possible that patients with underlying&#xD;
      liver disease may have altered AZT pharmacokinetics and may metabolize AZT differently, with&#xD;
      the result that they are susceptible to an increased risk of serious drug toxicity. This&#xD;
      study will examine the pharmacokinetics, elimination, and metabolism of AZT in patients with&#xD;
      liver disease. Guidelines developed from the data will be helpful in managing AZT treatment&#xD;
      of these HIV-infected persons and will indicate whether the dose of AZT administered should&#xD;
      be adjusted to compensate for any changes in its bioavailability and/or pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

      AZT is the only antiviral agent that has been shown to be effective in patients with severe&#xD;
      HIV infection. However, AZT is largely eliminated from the body through a biochemical&#xD;
      reaction that takes place in the liver, and it is possible that patients with underlying&#xD;
      liver disease may have altered AZT pharmacokinetics and may metabolize AZT differently, with&#xD;
      the result that they are susceptible to an increased risk of serious drug toxicity. This&#xD;

      be adjusted to compensate for any changes in its bioavailability and/or pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assessed and stratified according to liver function and severity of liver&#xD;
      disease. Patients receive an intravenous (IV) dose of AZT on the first day of the study,&#xD;
      followed by an oral dose 24 hours later on the second day of the study. Patients fast for 8&#xD;
      hours prior to each dose and for 2 hours after each dose. Liver function tests are repeated&#xD;
      on the first day of the study. In each patient, serial measurements of serum and urine AZT&#xD;
      and its metabolite, 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'-glucuronylthymidine (GAZT), are monitored after both&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed after completion of day 2 of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior medications may be resumed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study will be divided into three groups of cooperative patients according to mild,&#xD;
        moderate, or severe liver disease. Severity of disease will be assessed within 7 days of&#xD;
        entry into the study according to laboratory values. Patients must have normal kidney&#xD;
        function. No medications should be taken for 48 hours prior to entering the study.&#xD;
        Hemophiliacs are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zidovudine (AZT) if discontinued at least 48 hours prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
