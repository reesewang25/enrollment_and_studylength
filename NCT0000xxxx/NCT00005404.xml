      To evaluate the relationships of compliance in taking aspirin or aspirin placebo with the&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physicians' Health Study was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled primary&#xD;
      prevention trial designed to test whether 325 mg aspirin every other day reduced risks of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and whether 50 mg beta-carotene on alternate days decreased cancer&#xD;
      incidence among 22,071 male U.S. physicians, aged 40-84 years in 1982. Compliance with study&#xD;
      pills, the use of non-study aspirin and platelet active drugs, specific side effects of&#xD;
      aspirin, the incidence of conditions indicating aspirin use, and study outcomes were assessed&#xD;
      at six month intervals during the first year and annually thereafter. The blinded aspirin&#xD;
      component of the trial was terminated early and participants were unblinded on January 25,&#xD;
      1988, due to the emergence of a statistically extreme benefit of aspirin on both fatal and&#xD;
      nonfatal myocardial infarction, as well as the extraordinarily low cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      rates among study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate dose-response relationships were estimated in the aspirin and in the placebo group&#xD;
      to determine whether compliance in the placebo group was associated with lower risk, as had&#xD;
      been found in some previous trials. Rates of cardiovascular endpoints in the placebo group&#xD;
      relative to the aspirin group were adjusted for time-varying compliance with study tablets,&#xD;
      and the use of non-study aspirin and platelet active drugs. In addition, baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of the population and longitudinal assessment of side-effects and new&#xD;
      conditions suggesting aspirin therapy were used as predictors of compliance in taking study&#xD;
      pills separately in the aspirin and placebo groups. Similar longitudinal analyses determined&#xD;
      predictors of the use of non-study aspirin and platelet active drugs. The analyses were&#xD;
      intended to supplement the already published intent-to-treat analyses. They provided&#xD;
      observational evidence concerning dose of aspirin and the risks of major cardiovascular&#xD;
      endpoints. Examining modification of the aspirin effect in reducing risk of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction according to level of compliance aided in the generalizability of results to less&#xD;
      motivated populations. Evaluating determinants of good study compliance should be of benefit&#xD;
      to future large scale clinical trials.&#xD;
