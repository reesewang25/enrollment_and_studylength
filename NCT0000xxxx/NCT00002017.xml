  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and immunological effects of polyethylene glycolated-interleukin-2&#xD;
      (PEG-IL-2) on asymptomatic (without symptoms) HIV-seropositive patients who are taking&#xD;
      zidovudine (AZT). To enhance measures of immune function with well-tolerated doses of&#xD;
      PEG-IL-2, an immunomodulator, in a regimen designed to allow its use in outpatients with&#xD;
      normal daily activity (i.e., full-time employment, etc.). Recombinant IL-2 (without PEG&#xD;
      modification) was administered to HIV-infected patients by daily intradermal injection. At&#xD;
      the low doses used, this was non-toxic, well-tolerated, and gave a systemic response as&#xD;
      measured by natural killer cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, but required&#xD;
      daily administration. In the current study, the PEG modification of IL-2 is used since it has&#xD;
      a much longer prolonged half-life compared with the non-PEG compound, without loss of&#xD;
      functional activity.&#xD;

      Recombinant IL-2 (without PEG modification) was administered to HIV-infected patients by&#xD;
      daily intradermal injection. At the low doses used, this was non-toxic, well-tolerated, and&#xD;
      gave a systemic response as measured by natural killer cell and lymphokine-activated killer&#xD;
      cell activity, but required daily administration. In the current study, the PEG modification&#xD;
      of IL-2 is used since it has a much longer prolonged half-life compared with the non-PEG&#xD;
      compound, without loss of functional activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first, dose-escalation phase of the study, PEG-IL-2 is injected into the skin of the&#xD;
      back by either the intradermal (ID) or subcutaneous (SC) route, to establish an optimal dose&#xD;
      (which when given ID results in local induration = or &gt; 25 mm without significant toxicity).&#xD;
      The ID and SC routes are compared for systemic effect and toxicity. In the second phase of&#xD;
      the study, the PEG-IL-2 is administered for 6-8 weeks using the optimal dosage, frequency,&#xD;
      and route determined in the initial phase (probably 2-3 times per week) while local and&#xD;
      systemic effects are monitored. These include measures of viral titer, peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cell phenotype, CBC and CD4 counts, and in vitro cytotoxicity assays.&#xD;
