  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how the vaccines Remune (HIV-1 immunogen) and vCP1452&#xD;
      affect immune responses in patients who also are taking anti-HIV medications. This study also&#xD;
      will see if these vaccines are safe to use either alone or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with anti-HIV drugs does not always keep HIV viral load low and under control. This&#xD;
      study will look at the effect of the HIV vaccine, vCP1452, on the immune response and how it&#xD;
      works in combination with Remune. Information about immune responses and the safety of these&#xD;
      vaccines in HIV-positive patients will be gathered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human viral infections are controlled by the immune system. However, the multiple immune&#xD;
      responses provoked by HIV infection do not control the infection in most people. The ability&#xD;
      to specifically augment CTL responses with an immunotherapeutic vaccine may strengthen the&#xD;
      containment of viremia afforded by antiretroviral agents and thereby extend the durability of&#xD;
      viral suppression. The current study will attempt to determine whether therapeutic&#xD;
      immunizations with HIV-1 immunogen and vCP1452 are safe and able to augment HIV-1 specific&#xD;
      immune responses for a longer period of time than antiretroviral therapy alone, and if both&#xD;
      agents are better than either by itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients currently enrolled in A5058s under A5057/A5058s Versions 1.0 and 2.0 will be given&#xD;
      the option of continuing their participation in A5058s through this independent study.&#xD;
      Rollover patients register to Step II and begin treatment/evaluations on A5058s at the same&#xD;
      study week that they were on in Versions 1.0 and 2.0 of A5057/A5058s. New patients enter Step&#xD;
      I and will not need to register to Step II. Step I patients are stratified on the basis of&#xD;
      HIV viral load, antiretroviral history, and current antiretroviral treatment. Within each&#xD;
      stratum, patients are randomized to 1 of the following 4 treatment arms: HIV-1 immunogen plus&#xD;
      ALVAC placebo, HIV-1 immunogen placebo plus ALVAC placebo, HIV-1 immunogen placebo plus&#xD;
      vCP1452, or HIV-1 immunogen plus vCP1452. Patients receive an injection at study entry and&#xD;
      every 12 weeks thereafter until the end of the study, a minimum of 2 years. Step II patients&#xD;
      receive the same treatment as patients in Step I. Patients are evaluated every 12 weeks for&#xD;
      clinical, immunologic, and virologic parameters. Patients continue taking the antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment that they were taking at study entry until reaching a virologic relapse as defined&#xD;
      in the protocol. If no response to a new drug regimen occurs, or the antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      is not changed, immunizations may continue as long as the viral load remains below 5,000&#xD;
      copies/ml.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for Step I of this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been on stable anti-HIV combination drug therapy for at least 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             screening for viral load and are willing to continue the same treatment during the&#xD;
             study unless they experience side effects from the drugs and have a viral load&#xD;
             increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load lower than 50 copies/ml at screening. Patients must have had a viral&#xD;
             load below 500 copies/ml for at least 12 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a CD4 T cell count of at least 300 cells/mm3 within 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
