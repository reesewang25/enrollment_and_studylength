  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hyper IgE Syndromes (HIES) are primary immunodeficiencies resulting in eczema and&#xD;
      recurrent skin and lung infections. Autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIIES; Job's&#xD;
      syndrome) is caused by STAT3 mutations, and is a multi-system disorder with skeletal,&#xD;
      vascular, and connective tissue manifestations. Understanding how STAT3 mutations cause these&#xD;
      diverse clinical manifestations is critical to our complete understanding of bone metabolism,&#xD;
      bronchiectasis, dental maturation, and atherosclerosis. Bi-allelic mutations in DOCK8 cause a&#xD;
      combined immunodeficiency previously described as autosomal-recessive Hyper IgE syndrome.&#xD;
      These individuals suffer from extensive viral infections as well as have a high incidence of&#xD;
      malignancy and mortality. The pathogenesis of this disease and long-term natural history is&#xD;
      being investigated. Therefore, we seek to enroll patients and families with a confirmed or&#xD;
      suspected diagnosis of HIES syndrome for extensive phenotypic and genotypic study as well as&#xD;
      disease management. Patients will be carefully examined by a multidisciplinary team and&#xD;
      followed longitudinally. Through these studies we hope to better characterize the clinical&#xD;
      presentation of STAT3-mutated HIES, DOCK8 deficiency and other causes of the hyper IgE&#xD;
      phenotype, and to be able to identify further genetic etiologies, as well as understand the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of HIES. We seek to enroll 300 patients and 300 relatives.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be included in this study who:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Were referred to the NIH with a diagnosis or a suspicion of Hyper IgE syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are patients referred for other immune syndromes that demonstrate some of the&#xD;
             characteristics of HIES.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are male or female, aged&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aged&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;=1 month for affected subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged &gt;=2 years for unaffected subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For unaffected subjects, are able to understand and have the willingness to sign&#xD;
                  a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unaffected biological relatives of HIES patients are also eligible to enroll in a separate&#xD;
        relative cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Coronary CTA will not be performed on any patient younger than 30 years or with&#xD;
        contraindication to IV contrast media. This includes patients with 1) creatinine value of&#xD;
        &gt;1.3 mg/dL, 2) history of multiple myeloma, 3) Use of metformin-containing products less&#xD;
        than 24 hours prior to contrast media, and 4) history of significant allergic reaction to&#xD;
        CT contrast agents despite the use of premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a medical, psychiatric, or social condition which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator, would place undue burden on the subject, NIH resources, or increase risk of&#xD;
        participation, may be excluded.&#xD;
