  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to allow the evaluation, follow-up, and medical care of patients with&#xD;
      blood disorders not currently participating in a research study being conducted by the&#xD;
      Hematology Branch of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) or not being&#xD;
      screened for participation in a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to allow investigation into the blood disorders of patients in&#xD;
      order to teach, learn, and gather more information about diseases of the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study allows researchers the opportunity to evaluate patients referred to&#xD;
      the Hematology Branch of the NHLBI with rare or undiagnosed diseases of the blood. This may&#xD;
      be potentially beneficial to the patient and at the same time contribute to the development&#xD;
      of new research ideas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to allow the evaluation, follow up, and standard medical care of&#xD;
      patients (and when appropriate, their stem cell donor) with bone marrow failure states,&#xD;
      cytopenias, metastatic solid tumors, or hematologic malignancies not currently entered on an&#xD;
      active NHLBI protocol or not being screened for an active NHLBI research protocol. Its&#xD;
      purpose is to allow investigation into the hematologic problems of these patients for the&#xD;
      primary purpose of teaching and furthering general hematologic knowledge. The ability to&#xD;
      evaluate and treat patients with a wide variety of hematologic disease is critical to&#xD;
      maintaining our accreditation as a hematology fellowship program and training our fellows to&#xD;
      be competent hematologists, as well as for keeping all staff, including senior staff,&#xD;
      up-to-date and familiar with the evaluation and treatment of patients with a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      hematologic disease. It also allows the NHLBI investigators to evaluate patients referred&#xD;
      with rare or as yet undiagnosed hematologic problems, both potentially benefiting the patient&#xD;
      and stimulating new research directions for the NHLBI in the future. Periodic follow-up and&#xD;
      treatment of patients previously entered on NHLBI protocols in order to monitor the long-term&#xD;
      course of the underlying hematologic state and the consequences of experimental treatments is&#xD;
      also required for fellowship training, and for maintenance of good referral relationships&#xD;
      with patients and their physicians.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients (and when appropriate the patient's stem cell donor) may be entered on this&#xD;
        protocol at the discretion of the Principal and/or Associate Investigators if :&#xD;
&#xD;
        An investigator decides that it is in the best interest of the patient/donor and the Branch&#xD;
        for the patient to be enrolled in this protocol while awaiting a decision on eligibility&#xD;
        for other protocols; or after enrollment on another protocol, or to allow careful&#xD;
        evaluation of patients with unique or rare disorders of direct interest to the Branch; or&#xD;
        with more common disorders for fellowship teaching purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient or the patient's guardian is capable of informed consent and signs the consent&#xD;
        form. The consent form will be signed by parents or guardians of patients under the age of&#xD;
