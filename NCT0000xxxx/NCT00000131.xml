      To determine whether photocoagulation therapy can help prevent iris neovascularization in&#xD;
      eyes with central vein occlusion (CVO) and evidence of ischemic retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether grid-pattern photocoagulation therapy will reduce loss of central visual&#xD;
      acuity due to macular edema secondary to CVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop new data describing the course and prognosis for eyes with CVO.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Central vein occlusion is a common retinal vascular disorder with potentially blinding&#xD;
      complications. The two major complications are reduced central vision caused by macular edema&#xD;
      and neovascular glaucoma caused by iris neovascularization. Other clinical trials have shown&#xD;
      that laser photocoagulation is an effective treatment for complications found in diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy and branch vein occlusion, which have some features in common with CVO:&#xD;
      neovascularization and reduced visual acuity caused by macular edema occur in all three&#xD;
      disorders. Evidence from small-scale studies suggests that a grid pattern of photocoagulation&#xD;
      reduces macular edema in CVO patients, although the associated changes in visual acuity are&#xD;
      variable. The CVOS is a detailed investigation of grid pattern photocoagulation in a larger&#xD;
      randomized group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were divided into four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group N: Eyes with extensive retinal ischemia (at least 10 disc areas of nonperfusion) were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive panretinal photocoagulation or nontreatment unless iris&#xD;
      neovascularization developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group M: Eyes with visual loss ascribable to macular edema were randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      grid-pattern photocoagulation or nontreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group P: Eyes with relatively perfused retinas were followed to provide information about the&#xD;
      natural history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: Indeterminate eyes in which the retina could not be visualized accurately because of&#xD;
      hemorrhage were followed in a natural history study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Green argon laser with a slit lamp delivery system was used for all treatments. Photographic&#xD;
      documentation of retinal changes was obtained at entry, post-treatment, and at specified&#xD;
      followup visits for a period of at least 3 years. The frequency of followup visits varied&#xD;
      according to the group to which the CVO patient was assigned. Visual acuity, the primary&#xD;
      outcome factor in the group with macular edema, was measured according to a modified Early&#xD;
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol at each visit.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Men and women must have been age 21 or older and willing to return for followup visits for&#xD;
        3 years following assignment into the appropriate group and randomization. Each of the four&#xD;
        groups has specific eligibility criteria. Patients with retinal vascular disease other than&#xD;
        that specified in the criteria, such as diabetic retinopathy, were ineligible. Patients&#xD;
        with macular disease other than that due to CVO were ineligible for that portion of the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
