      This study will determine the effects of hormone replacement therapy (estrogen alone or&#xD;
      estrogen and progesterone) on the walls of arteries in postmenopausal women. Inflammation and&#xD;
      stiffness of artery walls are two risk factors for atherosclerosis-deposits of fatty&#xD;
      substances (plaques) that can block the vessel, causing a heart attack or stroke. Estrogen&#xD;
      raises the levels of certain substances in the blood that cause vessel inflammation and&#xD;
      lowers the levels of others. This study will measure the net effects of estrogen on artery&#xD;
      wall inflammation and stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postmenopausal women in good health may participate in this study. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility with a complete medical history, heart examination, and blood tests.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) hormone therapy (estradiol 2 mg&#xD;
      daily alone for women who have had a hysterectomy or estradiol plus micronized progesterone&#xD;
      200 mg daily for women with an intact uterus); or 2) placebo (look-alike pills that contain&#xD;
      no active drug). Women in both groups will take pills for 3 months, then no pills for 1&#xD;
      month, and then will crossover to the alternate therapy for 3 months (i.e., those in the&#xD;
      original placebo group will take hormones, and those in the hormone group will take placebo).&#xD;
      At the end of each 3-month treatment period, participants will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures to assess blood vessel inflammation and stiffness:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood tests - 60 cc (about 2 ounces) of blood will be drawn to measure levels of&#xD;
           hormones, cholesterol, and substances in the blood that indicate inflammation of the&#xD;
           vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasonography - an ultrasound probe will be applied gently on the neck to image the&#xD;
           right and left carotid arteries (arteries in the neck that lead to the brain). During&#xD;
           the procedure, the heart's electrical activity will also be monitored with an&#xD;
           electrocardiogram and a blood pressure cuff will be wrapped around the arm to obtain&#xD;
           blood pressure measurements every 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - Images of the carotid arteries are taken while the&#xD;
           volunteer lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. A padded&#xD;
           sensor called an MRI coil is placed over the neck and earplugs are placed in the ears to&#xD;
           muffle the loud noise of the machine during scanning. During the second half of the&#xD;
           exam, gadolinium is injected through a catheter (thin, flexible tube) inserted into a&#xD;
           vein. Gadolinium is a contrast agent that is used to brighten the scan images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from this study will increase knowledge about the effects of estrogen on vessel&#xD;
      wall inflammation. As such, it may be used in the future to help guide decisions about&#xD;
      chronic hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vascular inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and may&#xD;
      contribute to stiffening of arteries that increases the risk of myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      stroke. Accordingly, therapies that reduce vascular inflammation may reduce cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk. The effect of estrogen therapy on serum markers of inflammation in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      is divergent: Estrogen increases the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9), but decreases levels of the soluble cell adhesion molecules&#xD;
      ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. MMP-9 is secreted by macrophages and cytokine-activated smooth&#xD;
      muscle cells, with increased expression in the vicinity of atherosclerotic plaques. Although&#xD;
      activation of MMP-9 by estrogen could be deleterious in women with coronary artery disease by&#xD;
      digesting the fibrous caps of vulnerable plaques and provoking thrombosis (consistent with&#xD;
      the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study), activation of MMP-9 in healthy&#xD;
      postmenopausal women may remove excess matrix proteins that contribute to arterial stiffness&#xD;
      (reduced compliance), thus reducing cardiovascular risk (consistent with the Nurses' Health&#xD;
      Study). Reduction of levels of cell adhesion molecules might protect against new plaque&#xD;
      development in both groups of women. The purposes of this protocol are to determine the net&#xD;
      effects of estrogen therapy on 1) vascular inflammation in postmenopausal women, using&#xD;
      MRI/MRA imaging of the carotid arteries, and 2) arterial compliance, derived from carotid&#xD;
      ultrasonography and blood pressure measurements.&#xD;
