      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver&#xD;
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      in different ways may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients who have ovarian cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective iss to determine the safety of indium (111In) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody (mAb) hu3S193 (111In-hu3S193) given intraperitoneally or intravenously in patients&#xD;
      with ovarian carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include comparing the localization of 111In-hu3S193 in ovarian cancer&#xD;
      tissue after intraperitoneal vs intravenous injection and the biodistribution and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of this drug when administered intraperitoneally vs intravenously in these&#xD;
      patients as well as the formation of human anti-human antibodies (HAHA) in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms on a first come sequential basis. Arm&#xD;
      I: Patients receive indium (In 111) monoclonal antibody hu3S193 (111In-hu3S193)&#xD;
      intraperitoneally over 30 minutes. Arm II: Patients received 111In-hu3S193 intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 30 minutes. Patients were to undergo surgical debulking 3-7 days following In&#xD;
      111In-hu3S193 administration, and biopsy samples obtained to assess radioactive uptake.&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry was also to be performed. Blood samples were to be obtained to assess&#xD;
      serum radioactivity. Whole body imaging was tp be performed 3 hours after infusion of&#xD;
      radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, on the day of surgery, and at one time point in between.&#xD;
      Patients were followed for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients (5 per arm) were to be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <description>Hu3S193 was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 5 mg radiolabeled with 5 millicurie (mCi) of 111In.&#xD;
Patients received 10 mCi 99mTc-sulphur colloid IP administered in 500 ml of normal saline to assure the absence of any loculation or heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity in the peritoneal cavity. A paracentesis catheter was inserted and the hu3S193 was diluted in 100 mL of 5% human serum albumin and administered as a continuous intraperitoneal infusion over 30 minutes. This was followed immediately by 900 mL of normal saline.</description>

Patients received 10 mCi 99mTc-sulphur colloid IP administered in 500 ml of normal saline to assure the absence of any loculation or heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity in the peritoneal cavity. A paracentesis catheter was inserted and the hu3S193 was diluted in 100 mL of 5% human serum albumin and administered as a continuous intraperitoneal infusion over 30 minutes. This was followed immediately by 900 mL of normal saline.</description>
