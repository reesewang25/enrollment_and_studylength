  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of the new anti-inflammatory drug, Celebrex, on&#xD;
      relieving pain after oral surgery. It is also designed to assess the drug's selective&#xD;
      inhibition of a chemical called cyclooxygenase-2 and not its closely related form,&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase-1. This selective inhibition allows pain alleviation without the adverse side&#xD;
      effects (e.g., bleeding and stomach upset) often associated with anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers who require removal of their third molars are eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants will have oral surgery for tooth extraction after receiving a local anesthetic&#xD;
      (lidocaine) in the mouth and a sedative (midazolam) through an arm vein. On the evening&#xD;
      before and 1 hour before surgery, patients will be given a dose of either the standard&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin), or Celebrex, or a placebo (a pill&#xD;
      with no active ingredient). After surgery, a small piece of tubing will be placed in each&#xD;
      extraction site and tied to an adjacent tooth to hold it in place. Samples will be collected&#xD;
      from the tubing to measure chemicals involved in pain and inflammation. Patients will stay in&#xD;
      the clinic for up to 6 hours after surgery while the anesthetic wears off and will complete&#xD;
      pain questionnaires. During that time, they may receive acetaminophen plus codeine (Tylenol&#xD;
      3), if needed, for pain. The tubing then will be removed and the patient discharged with&#xD;
      standard pain medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostanoids are mediators that have been implicated in all stages of inflammation. The&#xD;
      inhibition of prostanoid synthesis by NSAIDs forms the basis of their therapeutic as well as&#xD;
      side effects. NSAIDs directly inhibit cyclooxygenase [COX], which leads to reduction of&#xD;
      prostaglandin synthesis and also to gastric erosions, inhibition of platelet aggregation and&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity. The identification of the two isoforms of COX lead to the hypothesis that&#xD;
      COX-2 is responsible for the production of prostaglandins following tissue injury, while&#xD;
      COX-1 is involved in normal homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selective COX-2 inhibitors are believed to be efficacious anti-inflammatory drugs devoid&#xD;
      of the side effects associated with the inhibition of COX-1. However, the selectivity of&#xD;
      these drugs has only been demonstrated in vitro and ex vivo, which may not be a reliable&#xD;
      indicator of the in vivo selectivity. The proposed study aims to evaluate the in vivo&#xD;
      selectivity of celecoxib, a drug demonstrated to be a selective inhibitor of COX-2 in vitro&#xD;
      in the oral surgery model of acute inflammation.&#xD;
