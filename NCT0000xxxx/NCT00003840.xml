      RATIONALE: DTGM fusion protein may be able to locate cancer cells and stop them from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of DTGM fusion protein in treating&#xD;
      patients who have recurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of DTGM fusion protein in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory adult acute myeloid leukemia. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic&#xD;
      effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Measure the pharmacokinetics of this regimen&#xD;
      in these patients. IV. Evaluate the response rate at the maximum tolerated dose and immune&#xD;
      responses in patients treated with this regimen. V. Correlate in vitro sensitivity of&#xD;
      leukemic blasts to this regimen with the response rate in these patients. VI. Correlate tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor genetic polymorphisms with toxicity profiles and dose-limiting toxic effects&#xD;
      of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to serum level of&#xD;
      anti-DTGM antibody titer (2 mg/L or less vs greater than 2 mg/L). Patients receive DTGM&#xD;
      fusion protein IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5. Patients with a partial response are eligible&#xD;
      for retreatment. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DTGM fusion protein&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose&#xD;
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the&#xD;
      MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with DTGM fusion&#xD;
      protein at the MTD. Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.&#xD;
