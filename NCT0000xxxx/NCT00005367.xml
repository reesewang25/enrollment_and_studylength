    <textblock>
      To conduct a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of the determinants of prolonged heart rate&#xD;
      corrected QT interval (QTc) among 300 men and 300 woman in the population with the highest&#xD;
      known risk of SUDS: Southeast Asian refugees in Thailand. .&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden and unexplained death in sleep (SUDS) is a leading cause of death of young men in&#xD;
      several Asian populations. The immediate cause is ventricular fibrillation in the absence of&#xD;
      known disease. A strong environmental component may be inferred from the regional nature of&#xD;
      SUDS in groups that are culturally and genetically distinct and the rapid decline in rates of&#xD;
      SUDS after migration of Southeast (SE) Asian refugees to the United States. Risk of SUDS&#xD;
      rises sharply to a peak among men aged 35 years of age, then declines with increasing age. In&#xD;
      a pilot studies of SE Asian refugee men in Thailand with the highest known risk of SUDS, the&#xD;
      investigators documented high-prevalences of prolonged heart rate corrected QT interval&#xD;
      (QTc), thiamine deficiency, hypokalemia, and a positive association between poor thiamine&#xD;
      status, measured by erythrocyte transketolase activity (ETK), and QTc. These limited studies&#xD;
      were unable to precisely quantify the relationship between QTc and thiamine status, lacked&#xD;
      sufficient power to examine the relationship between QTc and hypokalemia, did not include&#xD;
      other electrolytes, and did not address the striking differences in risk of SUDS by sex and&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was cross-sectional in design. During a 14-month period, informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from subjects selected in an age-stratified random sample of refugees scheduled for&#xD;
      routine medical screening. Blood samples, 12-lead and 24-hour ECGs, and interview data were&#xD;
      collected to test the following hypotheses: (1) mean QTc was greater in men than women, (2)&#xD;
      mean QTc was greater in men aged 30-39 years than in men younger or older; no similar&#xD;
      relationship was expected among women, (3) QTc was positively correlated with poor thiamine&#xD;
      status, measured by erythrocyte transketolase activity, (4-6) QTc was negatively correlated&#xD;
      with serum levels of potassium, magnesium, and total calcium, and (7) QTc was associated with&#xD;
      abnormalities of autonomic control of the heart, as indicated by power spectral analysis of&#xD;
      heart rate variability. Secondary aims included studying interactions of thiamine status and&#xD;
      electrolytes in the prolongation of QTc, dynamic analysis of QT variation by heart rate level&#xD;
      in 24-hr ECGs, and collection of blood specimens for later genetic studies&#xD;
