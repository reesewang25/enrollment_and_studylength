  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To confirm the ability of pulmonary (lung) function testing (PFT) to detect Pneumocystis&#xD;
      carinii pneumonia (PCP) before the development of clinical symptoms and to determine if&#xD;
      pentamidine (PEN), a drug used in treating PCP, can be given effectively as an aerosol&#xD;
      (inhaled mist). Other goals include the measurement of the actual amount of PEN that reaches&#xD;
      the lung, and to determine if close clinical observation is safer and as effective as drug&#xD;
      therapy for the prevention of subsequent episodes of PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many AIDS patients develop PCP, but the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment of PCP&#xD;
      is not known. The effectiveness of PEN may be improved if treatment is begun when the&#xD;
      parasite burden (the number of organisms in the lung) is still small, and before respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms appear. If PFT of HIV-infected patients is able to identify patients in the early&#xD;
      stages of infection, outpatient treatment of these patients offers a possible alternative to&#xD;
      the expense and toxicity of continuous preventive therapy of all high-risk patients.&#xD;

      Many AIDS patients develop PCP, but the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment of PCP&#xD;
      is not known. The effectiveness of PEN may be improved if treatment is begun when the&#xD;
      parasite burden (the number of organisms in the lung) is still small, and before respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms appear. If PFT of HIV-infected patients is able to identify patients in the early&#xD;
      stages of infection, outpatient treatment of these patients offers a possible alternative to&#xD;
      the expense and toxicity of continuous preventive therapy of all high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are treated with aerosolized PEN on an outpatient basis. The aerosol therapy is&#xD;
      given by a respiratory therapist 5 times a week, for a total of 21 days of treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, patients participate in two radioactive aerosol studies in which the patient&#xD;
      inhales a radioactive gas while sitting with his/her back against a gamma camera. The&#xD;
      resulting picture outlines the lungs. Then the gas is exhaled and the patient breathes an&#xD;
      aerosol of PEN. This mist contains a single dose of PEN mixed with a small amount of&#xD;
      radioactivity (99mTc-pertechnetate). The gamma camera determines where the particles deposit&#xD;
      in the lungs. The radioactive exposure is equivalent to a typical x-ray of the ribs. Patients&#xD;
      also undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy with lavage, and PFT. Blood is drawn to measure the&#xD;
      blood level of PEN. Patients are followed (clinical exams and PFT's) for 6 months after the&#xD;
      end of therapy. Prophylaxis for PCP is allowed during the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed during aerosolization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Metaproterenol or albuterol to treat bronchospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV infection confirmed by ELISA, HIV culture, or p24 antigenemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected subclinical Pneumocystis carinii infection as detected by &gt; 10 percent&#xD;
             change in lung volumes and/or diffusing capacity indicative of progressive restrictive&#xD;
             disease as detected by monthly screening pulmonary function tests (PFT's). Patients&#xD;
             will be afebrile and have no respiratory signs or symptoms of clinical disease.&#xD;
             Morphologic confirmation of pneumocysts will be determined by bronchoalveolar lavage&#xD;
             (BAL) performed 24 hours after the initial aerosol inhalation. If the BAL is negative&#xD;
             for pneumocysts, the patient will be withdrawn from this protocol and will be followed&#xD;
             per the screening PFT protocol at Stony Brook.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnostic bronchoscopy and BAL must be performed within 2 weeks of detection of &gt; 10&#xD;
             percent change in PFTs.&#xD;
