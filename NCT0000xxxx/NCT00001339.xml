    <textblock>
      This is a study of infusional doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide in combination with&#xD;
      daily oral mitotane in patients with adrenocortical cancer. Although mitotane has been used&#xD;
      extensively in adrenocortical cancer and has documented single agent activity, only limited&#xD;
      experience is available in the use of mitotane in combination with chemotherapy. In this&#xD;
      trial the primary reason for using mitotane is an attempt to enhance therapeutic efficacy,&#xD;
      based on its documented in-vitro activity as an antagonist of P-glycoprotein. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the efficacy of this therapy by treating patients who are&#xD;
      considered candidates for surgical resection at presentation or following a response to&#xD;
      therapy. Following chemotherapy, patients deemed surgical candidates can undergo surgical&#xD;
      resection with evaluation of response. Patients responding to chemotherapy will resume the&#xD;
      combination treatment after surgery. Patients who do not respond will be maintained on single&#xD;
      agent mitotane until it is deemed ineffective.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Biopsy-proven primary or recurrent adrenocortical carcinoma considered surgically&#xD;
        resectable at presentation or potentially resectable following an initial response to&#xD;
        chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potentially resectable disease includes primary lesion, nodal metastases, and liver and&#xD;
        lung metastases if limited in size and number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients for whom surgical resection is considered unlikely may be entered at the&#xD;
        discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Measurable disease at presentation required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A life expectancy of at least 3 months and a performance status (Karnofsky scale) of 70&#xD;
        percent or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior chemotherapy is allowed, however, the patient should not have received chemotherapy&#xD;
        four weeks before presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received prior doxorubicin may be enrolled provided they meet all other&#xD;
        entry criteria and have an ejection fraction greater than 40 percent determined by MUGA&#xD;
        scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior mitotane therapy is allowed. A dose of 3 gm/day should have been tolerated for at&#xD;
        least one week. Patients do not need to be off mitotane therapy prior to starting this&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WBC greater 3,000/mm(3); Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm(3); Creatinine clearance&#xD;
        greater than 50 ml/min; bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dl; serum transaminase less than 2 times&#xD;
        normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient should be a good surgical candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must sign an informed consent and be geographically accessible to return for follow up&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No presence of a second malignancy, other than squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No active systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not be currently receiving treatment which cannot be discontinued with the following&#xD;
        agents: diltiazem, nicardipine, phenothiazines, phenytoin, terfenadine or verapamil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No positive serology for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No positive pregnancy test.&#xD;
