  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to delineate the range of severity, natural history, molecular etiology, and&#xD;
      pathophysiology of Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome&#xD;
      (GCPS), McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), Oro-facial digital&#xD;
      syndromes (OFDs), and other overlapping phenotypes. These disorders comprise a syndrome&#xD;
      community of overlapping manifestations and we hypothesize that this is a reflection of a&#xD;
      common mechanistic pathway. This hypothesis be addressed by a combined clinical-molecular&#xD;
      approach where we bring up to 50-100 patients with each disorder to the NIH clinical center&#xD;
      for a comprehensive clinical evaluation with follow-up at a frequency appropriate to the&#xD;
      disorder. Specimens will be collected and evaluated in the laboratory by linkage analysis,&#xD;
      physical mapping, candidate gene characterization, mutation screening, and cell biologic&#xD;
      studies of normal mutant proteins.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We aim to use the power of modern molecular genetics and clinical research to delineate the&#xD;
&#xD;
      range of severity, natural history, molecular etiology, and pathophysiology of a number of&#xD;
&#xD;
      congenital anomaly syndromes. The goal of the research is to develop a knowledge base that&#xD;
      allows proper clinical and molecular diagnosis of patients with rare congenital anomaly&#xD;
&#xD;
      disorders. Our paradigm is the previous work we have done with Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS)&#xD;
      and Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), where we have successfully used a combined&#xD;
      clinical-molecular approach. Using this strategy, we have brought 50-100 patients or families&#xD;
      with these disorders to the NIH clinical center (NIH CC) for a comprehensive clinical&#xD;
      evaluation with follow-up at a frequency appropriate to the disorder. We have also clinically&#xD;
      and/or molecularly evaluated many additional patients with atypical or non-classic&#xD;
      presentations of PHS and GCPS and have conducted exploratory studies of other phenotypes to&#xD;
      determine how they might fit into the more general models generated to explain PHS and GCPS.&#xD;
      We are currently generalizing this approach to a number of disorders including talipes&#xD;
      equinovarus, atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, and persistent left superior vena cava&#xD;
      (TARP) syndrome. Specimens from patients participating in both the laboratory and clinical&#xD;
      arms of the protocol will be collected and evaluated in the laboratory by linkage analysis,&#xD;
      physical mapping, candidate gene characterization, mutation screening and targeted exome&#xD;
      sequencing, and cell biologic studies of normal and mutant proteins.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with clinical manifestations of a congenital anomaly or craniofacial syndrome, or&#xD;
        a single congenital anomaly that is also seen as part of a congenital anomaly syndrome will&#xD;
        be considered eligible for participation in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Blood will also be requested on unaffected relatives that could be informative for linkage&#xD;
        studies or for determining co-segregation of mutations within families. Subjects of either&#xD;
        gender and all ethnic and racial groups will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prenatal specimens (amniocentesis or CVS) will be accepted if they are previously acquired&#xD;
        for clinically indicated reasons. Cord blood or placenta specimens may be accepted if they&#xD;
        (or a part of them) are not needed for clinical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specimens from patients collected at outside institutions may be accepted into the study if&#xD;
        they were collected under an IRB-approved protocol at an MPA or FWA institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Coded specimens (specimens linked to identifiers but without personal identifiers attached&#xD;
        to the sample) may be acquired from other NIH investigators, analyzed, and returned as&#xD;
        research results to that investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with typical GCPS or PHS who have demonstrated GLI3 mutations may be excluded from&#xD;
        this study. Patients with phenotypes and disorders with a high risk/benefit ratio such as&#xD;
        late-onset, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and cancer-predisposition disorders will be&#xD;
        excluded from participation. Similarly, patients who are medically fragile or unable to&#xD;
        tolerate travel to the NIH CC will not routinely be eligible for participation. Probands&#xD;
        who are adults and decisionally-impaired are ineligible if they do not have a legal&#xD;
        guardian who has authority to sign a consent form on their behalf.&#xD;
