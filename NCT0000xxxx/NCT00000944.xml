  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination anti-HIV drug treatment regimen of&#xD;
      indinavir plus lamivudine (3TC) plus zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in treating HIV and in&#xD;
      reducing the chances of passing HIV from mother to child. This study will also examine if&#xD;
      this combination is well tolerated by HIV-positive pregnant women and if a combination of 3TC&#xD;
      plus ZDV is safe for newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies in adults and children have shown that indinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV can&#xD;
      reduce the amount of HIV in the blood. Most HIV-positive pregnant women usually take ZDV to&#xD;
      treat HIV and to reduce the chances of giving HIV to their babies. The combination of drugs&#xD;
      in this study may be more effective than ZDV alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the dramatic reduction of perinatal HIV transmission following the administration of&#xD;
      ZDV to mothers and infants, new, more effective strategies are needed. An increasing number&#xD;
      of women may require combination antiretroviral therapy for their own disease because they&#xD;
      may be resistant to ZDV, may have high viral loads, or may have previously transmitted HIV to&#xD;
      an infant while on ZDV monotherapy. The initiation of triple combination therapy, including a&#xD;
      protease inhibitor indinavir, during gestation may be the most effective in reducing maternal&#xD;
      virus load prior to delivery, thereby potentially benefitting both mother and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antepartum (until active labor): Indinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV. Intrapartum (active labor until&#xD;
      cord clamping): 3TC plus ZDV. Postpartum (after cord clamped to 12 weeks): Indinavir plus 3TC&#xD;
      plus ZDV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3TC plus ZDV as soon as oral intake is tolerated (preferably within 12 hours of birth) and&#xD;
      continuing for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/27/99: For maternal dosing, one Combivir tablet bid can be substituted&#xD;
      for the individual formulation of 3TC and ZDV. For mothers who receive Combivir during the&#xD;
      antepartum period, Combivir is held during labor and delivery, and the separate formulations&#xD;
      of ZDV and 3TC are used. Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment should continue&#xD;
      to be followed on study for the duration of the study.]&#xD;
