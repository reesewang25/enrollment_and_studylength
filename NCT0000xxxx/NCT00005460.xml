      To evaluate factors associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cohort of 795&#xD;
      men and women aged 75 years or older at the time of a comprehensive examination conducted&#xD;
      between 1984 and 1987.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was needed because evidence in 1991 suggested that cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      which had been identified by studies of middle-aged populations did not have the same&#xD;
      predictive value in the elderly; especially the &quot;oldest old&quot; aged 75 and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study analyzed data that had been collected over the years. At the time of the analysis,&#xD;
      mortality follow-up was complete for over 99 percent of subjects, and incident morbidity&#xD;
      information was available for myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery and stroke. The&#xD;
      database included measurements which allowed: 1) prospective analyses of the effects of&#xD;
      putative cardiovascular risk factors on disease incidence in the elderly, 2) prospective&#xD;
      analyses of the impact of change in risk factors on events in the elderly, 3) exploration of&#xD;
      risk factors not classically associated with cardiovascular events in younger populations but&#xD;
      which may be important in the very old, and, 4) cross-sectional description of putative risk&#xD;
      factors in an aged population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
