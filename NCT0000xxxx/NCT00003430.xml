      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of L-778,123 in treating patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of L-778,123 in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or refractory solid tumors. II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of L-778,123 including&#xD;
      qualitative, quantitative, and dose limiting toxicity in these patients. III. Assess the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate the radiologic or&#xD;
      tumor marker responses to treatment in these patients. V. Evaluate the relationship between&#xD;
      ras mutations and response to treatment in these patients. VI. Determine the relationship&#xD;
      between plasma drug levels and farnesylation assay results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive continuous infusions of L-778,123&#xD;
      over 7 days every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxic effects. All patients are observed for at least 1 week after the 7 day&#xD;
      infusion of L-778,123 prior to subsequent dose escalation. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of L-778,123 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. MTD is&#xD;
      defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities. Patients are followed until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
