  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare two different routes of intermittently administered rhIL-2 with a highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral regimen (HAART) to HAART alone. The comparison is based on the following:&#xD;
      proportion of patients achieving at least 50-percent increase in CD4 counts above&#xD;
      prerandomization baseline values after 1 year of rhIL-2 and the rate of change in CD4 counts.&#xD;
      To compare the safety and tolerance of these regimens and their effect on quality of life. To&#xD;
      assess the effects of rhIL-2 when combined with HAART on changes in immune cell phenotypes&#xD;
      and function and on HIV viral load and the rate of antiviral drug resistance development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The poor responsiveness of late stage HIV-infected patients to rhIL-2 is thought to occur&#xD;
      because of low T cell regenerative capacity and high viral burden. If means were available to&#xD;
      effectively suppress virus replication, the indigenous immune restorative responses of the&#xD;
      host may be further stimulated and enhanced by rhIL-2. The use of protease inhibitors with&#xD;
      nucleoside-analogue combination regimens appears to be most effective in controlling virus&#xD;
      replication. High-dose intermittent rhIL-2 administered either intravenously or&#xD;
      subcutaneously has been shown to be effective in inducing CD4 responses in a number of&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      The poor responsiveness of late stage HIV-infected patients to rhIL-2 is thought to occur&#xD;
      because of low T cell regenerative capacity and high viral burden. If means were available to&#xD;
      effectively suppress virus replication, the indigenous immune restorative responses of the&#xD;
      host may be further stimulated and enhanced by rhIL-2. The use of protease inhibitors with&#xD;
      nucleoside-analogue combination regimens appears to be most effective in controlling virus&#xD;
      replication. High-dose intermittent rhIL-2 administered either intravenously or&#xD;
      subcutaneously has been shown to be effective in inducing CD4 responses in a number of&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive HAART consisting of two nucleoside analogues (at least one of which is&#xD;
      new to the patient) and the protease inhibitor indinavir for 12 weeks. At Week 10, an HIV RNA&#xD;
      is done. Patients with more than 5,000 copies/ml are taken off the study. Patients with 5,000&#xD;
      copies/ml or less continue on the study and are stratified by their antiretroviral&#xD;
      combination, and randomized to one of three treatment arms. Patients on Arm I continue HAART&#xD;
      alone for an additional 72 weeks. Patients on Arm II continue HAART plus intermittent rhIL-2&#xD;
      by continuous intravenous (CIV) administration for an additional 72 weeks (9 courses).&#xD;
      Patients who achieve both at least a 25-percent increase and at least a 100-cell increase in&#xD;
      CD4 count above prerandomization baseline switch to subcutaneously administered rhIL-2 after&#xD;
      3 courses (24 weeks) or 6 courses (48 weeks) of CIV therapy for the remainder of their&#xD;
      treatment course. Patients on Arm III continue HAART plus subcutaneous rhIL-2 for an&#xD;
      additional 72 weeks (9 courses). [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/31/97: When protocol ACTG 928 is&#xD;
      activated, patients randomized on ACTG 328 are stratified based on whether or not they have&#xD;
      registered on ACTG 928.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/30/98: For the 4 weeks immediately prior to&#xD;
      randomization, patients must receive continuous HAART therapy. Exceptions may be made by the&#xD;
      protocol chair for short (i.e., less than 48 hours) interruptions of antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      during this period. Also per this amendment, two substudies have been added: A5033s and&#xD;
      A5046s. Patients who choose to enroll in substudy A5046s must do so at Week 60 of ACTG 328.&#xD;
      However, if the patient is already beyond Week 60 but not beyond Week 84 of ACTG 328 when&#xD;
      A5046s becomes available, he/she is still encouraged to participate in A5046s. For such&#xD;
      patients, ACTG 328 treatment is extended beyond Week 84 until the patient completes 24 weeks&#xD;
      of A5046s.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/23/99: Patients who choose to enroll in substudy A5046s must&#xD;
      do so at or after Week 64 of ACTG 328 and no later than Week 104.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99:&#xD;
      Patients choosing to enroll in A5046s must do so at or after Week 64 and no later than Week&#xD;
      128.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/22/99: A 16-week treatment extension is provided for patients who&#xD;
      have reached Week 84 of ACTG 328 and intend to enroll in either A5051 or A5046s (which are&#xD;
      currently not available).] [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/23/99: Therapy is extended for 24 weeks beyond&#xD;
      the original 84 weeks. Study treatment for patients awaiting co-enrollment into A5046s&#xD;
      continues for up to 20 weeks until co-enrollment and then until completion of A5046s (24&#xD;
      weeks). Study treatment continues for 24 weeks beyond Week 84 for patients who are awaiting&#xD;
      enrollment in A5051 or who have chosen not to participate in A5046s.] [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      6/3/99: A 24-week treatment extension has been added for patients who have reached Week 100&#xD;
      and intend to enroll in A5046s.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99: A treatment extension has been&#xD;
      added for up to 44 weeks beyond Week 84 and through completion of A5046s (24 weeks) for&#xD;
      on-study/on-study treatment patients who intend to co-enroll in A5046s. Patients who intend&#xD;
      to enroll in A5051 or A5046s and remain on ACTG 328 study treatment are eligible for the&#xD;
      treatment extension from Week 84 to Week 108. Patients who intend to co-enroll in A5046s and&#xD;
      remain on ACTG 328 study treatment are eligible for the treatment extension from Week 108 to&#xD;
      Week 128. All patients who are awaiting co-enrollment in A5046s must continue to receive&#xD;
      their assigned ACTG 328 treatment regimen. Study treatment for ACTG 328 patients awaiting&#xD;
      co-enrollment into A5046s will continue for up to 44 weeks and until completion of A5046s (24&#xD;
      weeks). Each patient is followed every 8 weeks for the duration of the treatment extension&#xD;
      period to monitor for safety and to collect cells and plasma for storage. No substudy&#xD;
      evaluations are performed during the 24-week extension.]&#xD;
