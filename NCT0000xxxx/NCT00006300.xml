  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are threefold: 1) to evaluate the prevalence and risks of oral&#xD;
      complications in patients with aplastic anemia; 2) to evaluate if oral problems in these&#xD;
      patients can predict their response to treatment; and 3) to review complications of dental&#xD;
      treatment in these patients in order to establish treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed through a review of medical charts of 79 patients with aplastic&#xD;
      anemia and 67 patients with schizophrenia who were treated at the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Dental Clinic between 1993 and 1999. The schizophrenia patients will serve as a&#xD;
      control population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, clinical and radiographic information will be collected for all patients.&#xD;
      Additional data collected only for aplastic anemia patients will include medical therapy,&#xD;
      disease duration, blood cell counts, oral problems that developed during treatment and&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;

      The prevalence, risk factors and significance of oral manifestations in aplastic anemia have&#xD;
      not been well characterized. Thus, in the present study, through a retrospective chart&#xD;
      review, we document the prevalence of oral complications in AA patients and the risks for&#xD;
      oral manifestations in a case-control study. Schizophrenic patients represent controls.&#xD;
      Information includes the following; demographic, clinical and radiographic information for&#xD;
      cases and controls. Additional data collection for only AA patients includes prior medical&#xD;
      therapy, CBC and differential, disease duration, new oral manifestations during AA treatment&#xD;
      and medical treatment response. We determine if systemic clinical features of AA predict oral&#xD;
      manifestations, and if oral manifestations predict treatment outcomes for AA patients.&#xD;
      Finally complications following dental treatment are compiled and reviewed to establish&#xD;
      initial treatment guidelines for these patients.&#xD;
