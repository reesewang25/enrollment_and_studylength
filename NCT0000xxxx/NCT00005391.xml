      To establish and maintain a national registry of children with different forms of&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with cardiomyopathy represent the most dismal outcome of any group of diseases&#xD;
      followed by pediatric cardiologists, with up to 40 percent of infants and children with&#xD;
      symptomatic cardiomyopathy failing medical or surgical management in the first year following&#xD;
      diagnosis. For 57 percent of children with cardiomyopathy, no etiology is known. Although&#xD;
      pediatric cardiomyopathy is common, there is considerable variation in its causes. Therefore,&#xD;
      for any specific etiology, no center of pediatric cardiology sees a sufficient number of&#xD;
      patients to make major advances in understanding this group of diseases. The registry was&#xD;
      developed to collect and organize all relevant data on the condition. Data accrued by and&#xD;
      reported by the registry should lead to increased awareness and knowledge of pediatric&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and its causes, as well as the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry consists of a prospective, population-based cohort of patients in New England&#xD;
      and the Central Southwestern United States and a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed&#xD;
      between 1991 and 1996. Annual follow-up data are collected on all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses are that l) during the period of the registry, the percentage of cases&#xD;
      that are diagnosed as idiopathic will decrease (i.e., etiologies will be found) and 2) at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, type of&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, and presence or absence of a syndrome can help predict outcomes. Definition&#xD;
      of entry and exclusion criteria, clinical quality assurance, and accrual and retention of&#xD;
      participating clinical centers are largely under the direction of the University of Rochester&#xD;
      in Rochester, New York and Baylor College of Medicine. Virtually all pediatric cardiology&#xD;
      centers in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada have expressed their willingness to&#xD;
      send patient information to such a registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was continued through May, 2010 to to investigate the natural history of&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and transplantation, establish a longitudinal cohort for investigating the&#xD;
      functional status of children with cardiomyopathy, and conduct viral and genetic testing to&#xD;
      assess associations of genetic and viral markers of cardiomyopathy with clinical and&#xD;
      functional outcomes. There are three specific aims. The first expands on the natural history&#xD;
      of cardiomyopathy and transplantation by integrating the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry&#xD;
      (PCMR) and the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study databases in order to examine whether and how&#xD;
      cardiac transplantation modifies the clinical course of cardiomyopathy in children. The&#xD;
      second specific aim focuses on the functional status of pediatric cardiomyopathy patients.&#xD;
      The study will establish the longitudinal course of functional status in children with&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, and analyze the relationship to clinical events and outcomes. This will be&#xD;
      accomplished by assessment of the functional status of pediatric cardiomyopathy patients,&#xD;
      including the subset of children undergoing heart transplantation, by continuation of the&#xD;
      current PCMR Functional Status Substudy and extension of the study to children in the&#xD;
      post-transplant-period period. The third specific aim relates to viral and genetic testing&#xD;
      and will investigate how genetic and viral markers of cardiomyopathy are associated with&#xD;
      clinical and functional outcomes. Cardiac tissue and blood samples will be collected from 300&#xD;
      children with cardiomyopathy for viral genome and genetic screening 9G4.5 gene) using the&#xD;
      Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Repository, and the results will be correlated to clinical outcome.&#xD;
