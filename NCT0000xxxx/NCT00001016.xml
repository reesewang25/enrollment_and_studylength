  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug trimetrexate (TMTX) with&#xD;
      leucovorin rescue (LCV) in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients&#xD;
      who have AIDS, are HIV positive, or are at high risk for HIV infection, and who have&#xD;
      demonstrated serious adverse effects from the conventional therapies for PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients (trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and&#xD;
      pentamidine) have had to be discontinued in many patients because of severe adverse effects.&#xD;
      Currently there are no proven alternatives to these drugs. TMTX was chosen for this trial&#xD;
      because it has been found to be very active against the PCP organism in laboratory tests. In&#xD;
      a preliminary trial, TMTX in combination with LCV has been effective against PCP with fewer&#xD;
      and less severe adverse effects.&#xD;

      The drugs usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients (trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and&#xD;
      pentamidine) have had to be discontinued in many patients because of severe adverse effects.&#xD;
      Currently there are no proven alternatives to these drugs. TMTX was chosen for this trial&#xD;
      because it has been found to be very active against the PCP organism in laboratory tests. In&#xD;
      a preliminary trial, TMTX in combination with LCV has been effective against PCP with fewer&#xD;
      and less severe adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: 08/01/90. As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled&#xD;
      studies of trimetrexate for PCP:214 in TX 301/ACTG 0=039 (trimetrexate for patients&#xD;
      intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to&#xD;
      approved therapies). The analysis of overall response rate, stringently defined as having&#xD;
      received at least 14 days of trimetrexate and being alive at follow-up 1 month after the&#xD;
      completion of therapy, reveals 84/159 intolerant patients and 48/160 refractory patients had&#xD;
      responded, for rates of 53 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These response rates include&#xD;
      all individuals who received at least one dose of trimetrexate. Of the 111 patients who were&#xD;
      ventilator-dependent at study entry, 18 completed a course of therapy and were alive a month&#xD;
      later, for a response rate of 16 percent. All other ventilated patients died. The most common&#xD;
      severe (grades 3 and 4) toxicities were: transaminase elevation (greater than 5 x normal) in&#xD;
      94 patients, anemia (less than 7.9 g/dl) in 109, neutropenia (less than 750 cells/mm3) in 58,&#xD;
      fever (greater than 40 degrees C) in 37, and thrombocytopenia (less than 50,000&#xD;
      platelets/mm3) in 27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity required discontinuation of therapy in approximately 5 percent of all patients.&#xD;
      Original design: Patients entered in the study are given TMTX once a day for 21 days and LCV&#xD;
      4 times a day (every 6 hours) for 24 days. Doses are determined by body size. Both drugs are&#xD;
      given by intravenous infusion, but LCV may be given orally after the first 10 days. Doses are&#xD;
      adjusted if side effects, such as low white blood cell counts, are too severe. During the&#xD;
      21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used because of possible increased bone marrow&#xD;
      toxicity. AZT may be resumed as soon as the administration of TMTX and LCV has been&#xD;
      completed. After treatment with TMTX, the patient may be treated with other drugs to prevent&#xD;
      the recurrence of PCP at the discretion of his/her physician.&#xD;
