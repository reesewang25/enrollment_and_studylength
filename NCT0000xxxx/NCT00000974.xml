      To evaluate the delivery of a single dose of aerosolized pentamidine to children; to evaluate&#xD;
      the tolerance of pentamidine administration by mask; to compare intravenous pentamidine first&#xD;
      dose pharmacokinetics (blood levels) in children with information previously collected on&#xD;
      adults; and to compare plasma pentamidine levels in children after an aerosolized treatment&#xD;
      with levels previously collected on adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most common serious infection in children with&#xD;
      AIDS and is associated with a high death rate. Current approved treatment includes&#xD;
      intravenous trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX) and intravenous pentamidine, which&#xD;
      are both effective in treatment of the first episode of PCP pneumonia. However, both&#xD;
      therapies have a 50 percent or greater incidence of adverse reactions. Because of serious&#xD;
      toxicities, drug treatment has had to be discontinued. Animal studies show that aerosolized&#xD;
      pentamidine (pentamidine given through inhalation) is as effective as intravenous&#xD;
      pentamidine. It is hoped that the aerosolized route will be less toxic than intravenous&#xD;
      pentamidine. The study is the first step in evaluating the delivery of aerosolized&#xD;
      pentamidine to children.&#xD;

      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most common serious infection in children with&#xD;
      AIDS and is associated with a high death rate. Current approved treatment includes&#xD;
      intravenous trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX) and intravenous pentamidine, which&#xD;
      are both effective in treatment of the first episode of PCP pneumonia. However, both&#xD;
      therapies have a 50 percent or greater incidence of adverse reactions. Because of serious&#xD;
      toxicities, drug treatment has had to be discontinued. Animal studies show that aerosolized&#xD;
      pentamidine (pentamidine given through inhalation) is as effective as intravenous&#xD;
      pentamidine. It is hoped that the aerosolized route will be less toxic than intravenous&#xD;
      pentamidine. The study is the first step in evaluating the delivery of aerosolized&#xD;
      pentamidine to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen patients are assigned into one of the following groups. Group 1 (four patients)&#xD;
      receives intravenous pentamidine as a one-time dose, infused over 2 hours. Group 2a (six&#xD;
      patients) receives aerosolized pentamidine via face mask. Group 2b (six patients) receives&#xD;
      aerosolized pentamidine 2 times. Group 2b will be studied only if initial dose is well&#xD;
      tolerated. Small amounts (1 - 2 cubic centimeters) of blood is taken from all groups at 40&#xD;
      minutes, and 2, 3, 7, 14, and 24 hours from the beginning of pentamidine treatment and at the&#xD;
      same time as the lung biopsy or bronchial alveolar lavage. Patients are given routine TMP /&#xD;
      SMX (or whatever medications are considered appropriate by the patient's primary physician&#xD;
      for medical management) dosing 1 - 2 hours after pentamidine is given. Bronchial alveolar&#xD;
      lavage fluid or lung tissue from biopsy will be obtained between 2 - 48 hours after&#xD;
      initiation of pentamidine treatment (optionally 10 - 24 hours post dose).&#xD;
