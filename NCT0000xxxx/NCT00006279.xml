  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give nevirapine (NVP) to breast-feeding&#xD;
      babies from birth to the age of 6 months and to determine what dose of NVP should be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast-feeding has been shown to be very important for the physical and mental health of&#xD;
      infants. This is especially true during the first 6 months of life. However, an HIV-positive&#xD;
      mother can pass the virus on to her baby by breast-feeding. Because of this risk,&#xD;
      HIV-positive mothers are encouraged to formula-feed, not breast-feed, their babies. In&#xD;
      developing countries, however, some women cannot afford to formula-feed. If they do&#xD;
      formula-feed, these women risk exposing their HIV status. These women have great need for&#xD;
      methods that can lower the chance that they will pass HIV on to their babies. This study will&#xD;
      test NVP as a way of doing this.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast-feeding is of such critical importance to the general health of the infant, as well as&#xD;
      the mother-infant relationship, that special efforts should be made to retain this practice&#xD;
      even during the HIV pandemic. Breast-feeding is associated with lower rates of infant&#xD;
      gastrointestinal infections and protects against high infant mortality from respiratory and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal diseases. These protective effects are greatest in the first 6 months of&#xD;
      life. However, HIV is transmitted through breast-feeding. HIV-infected women whose&#xD;
      circumstances permit them a choice between breast- and formula-feeding have been encouraged&#xD;
      to formula-feed. But in developing countries there are HIV-infected women who cannot afford&#xD;
      to formula-feed or who, knowing the risks, choose to breast-feed. In these societies,&#xD;
      HIV-infected women who deviate from the cultural norm of breast-feeding risk exposing their&#xD;
      HIV status and becoming prey to negative social implications. For this group of women,&#xD;
      defining strategies that can reduce their risk of transmitting HIV to their infants is&#xD;
      essential. Based on data from previous studies, this study proposes to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that NVP will reduce breast-feeding transmission of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant HIV-positive women take an oral dose of NVP at the onset of labor. A second dose of&#xD;
      NVP will be given 48 hours after the first dose if the woman remains in labor. Infants who&#xD;
      initiate breast-feeding are randomized to 1 of the 3 study arms below and receive their first&#xD;
      dose of NVP within 48 hours of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 receives NVP once a week, Arm 2 receives NVP twice a week, and Arm 3 receives NVP&#xD;
      daily. There is no placebo control group. The first 18 infants enrolled in each arm will&#xD;
      contribute pre- and post- NVP dose blood samples for pharmacokinetics. The remaining infants&#xD;
      will contribute data on safety and pre-dose NVP levels only. Infants return to the clinic&#xD;
      weekly for visual assessment of NVP toxicity. Women are counseled to stop breast-feeding&#xD;
      their infants by the end of 6 months. Infants receive their last dose of NVP at either 24&#xD;
      weeks of age or 1 week after breast-feeding cessation, whichever occurs first, and have&#xD;
      follow-up visits until the infant is 32 weeks old.&#xD;
