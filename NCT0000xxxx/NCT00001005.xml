      AMENDED: To investigate whether subcutaneous (SC) injection of IL-2 produces biological&#xD;
      responses which parallel those observed with IV dosing. Original design: To evaluate the&#xD;
      short-term effects of combined administration of zidovudine (AZT) and increasing doses of&#xD;
      recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients infected with HIV, who have&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy, but who are otherwise asymptomatic (no other symptoms). The first phase of&#xD;
      this clinical trial will establish maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). How quickly the drugs get&#xD;
      into the blood and how long they remain there (pharmacokinetics) will also be studied at each&#xD;
      dose as well as the effect on HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since AZT has no effect on cells that contain inactive virus (latently infected cells) and&#xD;
      these cells may act as viral reservoirs, that a second agent that can destroy these infected&#xD;
      cells would be useful in combination with AZT. The different activities of AZT and IL-2, as&#xD;
      well as the non-overlapping nature of their mechanisms of action and toxicity, increase the&#xD;
      theoretical benefits of combining AZT, a drug which has clinically significant activity in&#xD;
      HIV-related disease but cannot eliminate infected cells, with IL-2, a drug which may enhance&#xD;
      anti-HIV immunity, destroy chronically infected cells, and allow immune recognition of&#xD;
      latently infected cells.&#xD;

      Since AZT has no effect on cells that contain inactive virus (latently infected cells) and&#xD;
      these cells may act as viral reservoirs, that a second agent that can destroy these infected&#xD;
      cells would be useful in combination with AZT. The different activities of AZT and IL-2, as&#xD;
      well as the non-overlapping nature of their mechanisms of action and toxicity, increase the&#xD;
      theoretical benefits of combining AZT, a drug which has clinically significant activity in&#xD;
      HIV-related disease but cannot eliminate infected cells, with IL-2, a drug which may enhance&#xD;
      anti-HIV immunity, destroy chronically infected cells, and allow immune recognition of&#xD;
      latently infected cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five patients who have already received and tolerated oral AZT for at least 8 weeks continue&#xD;
      their AZT treatment and at the same time receive IL-2 on a schedule of 5 days on the drug, 2&#xD;
      days off the drug. The IL-2 is administered by 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion according&#xD;
      to this schedule for 4 weeks. The first week of IL-2 treatment is on an inpatient basis and&#xD;
      the remaining 3 weeks are on an outpatient basis. Toxicity is monitored every week. Maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the maximum dose at which 3 out of 5 patients experience&#xD;
      Grade 3 or above toxicity during the course of IL-2 administration. A second cohort of five&#xD;
      patients will receive IV IL-2. If the MTD is not reached, five additional patients will&#xD;
      receive IV IL-2. All five patients in a given cohort must complete a full 4-week course of&#xD;
      IL-2 before subsequent patients are entered at the next higher dose level. After IV dosing is&#xD;
      completed at these three levels, additional 5-patient cohorts receive subcutaneous (SC) IL-2&#xD;
      according to the same schedule. Each patient is restricted to one dosage group. Patients are&#xD;
      treated and followed for a total of 24 weeks. Patients receive ibuprofen for fever and&#xD;
      chills.&#xD;
