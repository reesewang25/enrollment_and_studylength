    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical and laboratory toxicity of ganciclovir (GCV) and zidovudine (AZT)&#xD;
      when given in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because recent information has shown AZT to be useful in treating AIDS, it is assumed that&#xD;
      most patients with AIDS, and probably with AIDS related complex (ARC), will be receiving AZT.&#xD;
      Because AZT is reported not to be active against cytomegalovirus (CMV), it is important to&#xD;
      see if it is useful to give GCV along with AZT.&#xD;

      Because recent information has shown AZT to be useful in treating AIDS, it is assumed that&#xD;
      most patients with AIDS, and probably with AIDS related complex (ARC), will be receiving AZT.&#xD;
      Because AZT is reported not to be active against cytomegalovirus (CMV), it is important to&#xD;
      see if it is useful to give GCV along with AZT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are placed into one of four groups at entry into study according to their previous&#xD;
      treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I: Prior treatment with AZT up to the time of developing CMV infection and not requiring dose&#xD;
      reduction of AZT for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II: Prior treatment with AZT up to the time of developing CMV infection and requiring dose&#xD;
      reduction of AZT for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III: Prior therapy with GCV for CMV infection. These patients should already be in the&#xD;
      maintenance phase, having completed a minimum of 2 weeks of induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV: No prior therapy with either AZT or GCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment lasts 24 weeks and consists of two treatment plans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: Patients not previously treated with GCV are started on GCV for an additional 22 weeks.&#xD;
      GCV is given as a 1-hour infusion. All patients are started on AZT at the lowest dose. B: For&#xD;
      patients with chronic CMV disease who are receiving GCV maintenance, GCV is administered as a&#xD;
      1-hour infusion 5 days/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZT is added and treatment with GCV is standardized prior to beginning of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic therapy such as analgesics, antihistamines, antiemetics, and antidiarrheal&#xD;

             degrees C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If fever of higher than 39.0 degrees C occurs for 2 consecutive days, the patient may&#xD;
