  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the safety and pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of recombinant human CD4&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (rCd4-IgG) in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) who have failed&#xD;
      or declined therapy with zidovudine (AZT). An additional goal of the study is to obtain a&#xD;
      preliminary indication of the antiviral effects of Cd4-IgG in patients with AIDS or ARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other approaches in addition to existing treatment of HIV infection need to be evaluated. One&#xD;
      approach may be to block HIV infection by interrupting the assembly of the virus within the&#xD;
      cell or the budding of virus from the membrane of the infected cell. In addition, blocking&#xD;
      the attachment of HIV to its cellular receptor may offer another point of attack. HIV binds&#xD;
      to the CD4 receptor on the target T4 lymphocyte and the envelope glycoprotein of the virus&#xD;
      (gp120) is capable of high affinity binding to CD4. Any agent that prevents the attachment of&#xD;
      gp120 to the CD4 receptor should be able to block virus transmission and spread. Recently,&#xD;
      scientists have succeeded in producing highly purified recombinant soluble human CD4.&#xD;
      Recombinant CD4 is capable of binding to HIV envelope protein (gp120) and inhibiting HIV&#xD;
      infectivity in test tube studies. Potential therapeutic benefit in patients with HIV&#xD;
      infection could be derived from either or both of these biologic effects. In order to extend&#xD;
      the length of time that rCD4 stays in the body, the compound has been modified by combining&#xD;
      it with a human immunoglobulin of the IgG1 class (IgG).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Each patient receives rCd4-IgG at a fixed dose level once weekly by intravenous bolus for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Four patients (two per center) are entered at each dose level starting with the lowest&#xD;
      dose. Dose escalation proceeds until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined. AMENDED:&#xD;
      Includes, as of 891201, an ancillary study entitled &quot;A Study of Recombinant&#xD;
      CD4-Immunoglobulin G (CD4-IgG) Levels in Cerebral Spinal Fluid after rCD4-IgG is Administered&#xD;
      by Intravenous Bolus in Patients With AIDS and AIDS-Related Complex&quot;. This involves selected&#xD;
      patients, at the discretion of the Investigator. AMENDED: 900110 To increase the dose and&#xD;
      frequency of administration of rCD4-IgG, based on preliminary results of pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analyses from Phase I studies in humans. Each patient receives rCD4-IgG therapy at a fixed&#xD;
      dose level 1x, 2x, or 3x weekly by intravenous bolus for 12 weeks. Follow-up is extended to 8&#xD;
      weeks. Total target accrual is 25 - 28 weeks. AMENDED: 900824 Extension of the Phase I study&#xD;
      of the safety and efficacy of CD4-IgG in patients with HIV infection. Each patient receives&#xD;
      one of two fixed doses by IV bolus injection twice per week for 12 weeks. 20 to 30 patients&#xD;
      to be enrolled. Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated. Clinical safety and antiviral effects&#xD;
      will be assayed.&#xD;
