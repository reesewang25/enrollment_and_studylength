      RATIONALE: Cryosurgery kills cancer cells by freezing them. Drugs used in chemotherapy use&#xD;
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining&#xD;
      cryosurgery with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cryosurgery with or without chemotherapy&#xD;
      in treating patients who have soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and morbidity associated with cryosurgical ablation in&#xD;
      patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: All patients undergo 1 session of cryoablation. Patients with high-grade sarcoma&#xD;
      receive systemic chemotherapy 10-14 days after cryoablation at the discretion of the&#xD;
      consulting medical oncologist, and undergo surgery 2-3 weeks following chemotherapy. Patients&#xD;
      with low-grade sarcoma and those with high-grade sarcoma who do not receive chemotherapy&#xD;
      undergo surgery 4-6 weeks after cryoablation. Surgery for all patients consists of en bloc&#xD;
      resection or amputation, with limb salvage attempted when feasible. Patients are followed&#xD;
      weekly for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients (approximately 6 patients with low-grade, high-risk&#xD;
      sarcoma and 6 with high-grade sarcoma) will be entered over approximately 6 months. The study&#xD;
      will be suspended for the following: vascular complication that requires surgical&#xD;
      intervention for correction in 2 patients; any neuropraxia that shows no evidence of&#xD;
      resolution after 3 months in 2 patients; any wound complication that requires surgical&#xD;
      correction in 4 patients; or any deep wound infection that requires surgical drainage in 4&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
