  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if PEG-Intron is safe and tolerated when given to&#xD;
      children, to see how much gets into the blood and how long it stays in the blood, and to see&#xD;
      how well it works to reduce viral load (level of HIV in the blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEG-Intron is an experimental drug that works differently than other anti-HIV medications. It&#xD;
      decreases the ability of HIV to infect the T cells (a special type of cell that helps fight&#xD;
      infection). PEG-Intron has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      hepatitis C in adults, but in this study, it is being used as an investigational agent for&#xD;
      the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It has not been tested in children before and experience with&#xD;
      PEG-Intron in adults is limited. (This protocol has been changed to reflect FDA approval of&#xD;
      PEG-Intron for treating hepatitic C in adults.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current optimal clinical management of HIV infection involves therapy with combinations&#xD;
      of nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and HIV protease inhibitors.&#xD;
      These regimens, though effective, do not completely eliminate HIV and the development of drug&#xD;
      resistance is a major clinical problem. Interferons have been proposed as a possible&#xD;
      treatment of HIV. Interferon-alfa inhibits HIV replication in vitro, and HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients appear to have reduced production of interferons. Previous short-term clinical&#xD;
      studies in adults showed anti-HIV activity, although there were safety and tolerability&#xD;
      problems associated with the higher dose regimens used. This study will utilize a rising&#xD;
      multiple-dose design to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and&#xD;
      multiple doses of PEG-Intron in HIV-infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a dose-escalation study, patients add weekly PEG-Intron to their antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      for up to 6 weeks. The first 2 doses are received in the clinic where parents/guardians are&#xD;
      trained to administer injections, and succeeding doses are given at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are enrolled from 2 cohorts. An older cohort of ages 2 to 16 years receives&#xD;
      PEG-Intron at the lowest drug level. If the dose is tolerated, patients are added and if&#xD;
      safety criteria are met, patients are enrolled in the next higher dose level. The dose level&#xD;
      will be increased similarly for up to 4 doses. An optimal dose level is chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort II patients are a younger group ranging from 3 months to under 2 years of age.&#xD;
      Patients initially receive the next lower PEG-Intron dose to the optimal dose identified in&#xD;
      Cohort I [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/23/01: or 1 microg/kg if the optimal dose proves to be 1&#xD;
      microg/kg]. If this dose is safely tolerated, additional patients are added. If this dose&#xD;
      level meets safety criteria, patients are enrolled to receive the optimal dose level.&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated with the same safety criteria as Cohort I. Patients in both cohorts&#xD;
      who have at least a 0.5 log reduction in HIV RNA at 28 days of treatment are offered&#xD;
      continued treatment for a total of 60 weeks.&#xD;
