      This study will test the effectiveness of topical thalidomide in healing mouth sores in HIV&#xD;
      infected patients. Oral (PO) thalidomide heals these sores at a dose of 200 mg per day.&#xD;
      However, PO thalidomide can cause drowsiness, skin rashes, allergic reactions, increased&#xD;
      viral load, and even nerve damage that may not be reversible. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of a topical formulation of thalidomide (placed directly on the surface of the sore)&#xD;
      for the healing of these sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with HIV infection of acquired immunodeficiency of at least 18 years of age with one&#xD;
      or more chronic, painful intraoral lesions may be eligible for this study. Subjects must be&#xD;
      referred by a primary care physician who is managing their care, and must have HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      status confirmed. Patients' HIV treatment regimen will not be altered and those receiving&#xD;
      highly active therapy will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if they are concurrently being treated for mucosal lesions&#xD;
      (including topical or systemic steroids, viscous lidocaine, topical or systemic anti-fungals,&#xD;
      or mouthwashes), or concurrent thalidomide therapy; receving chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
      therapy for neoplasms; using concurrent acute therapy for opportunistic infections;&#xD;
      concurrent use of sedatives (such as CNS depressants or alcohol use); history of allergy to&#xD;
      thalidomide; pre-existing peripheral neuropathy of grade II or higher; pregnant or lactating&#xD;
      females or those not practicing contraception according to FDA guidelines for thalidomide.&#xD;

      The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy of topically-applied thalidomide as a&#xD;
      treatment for painful oral lesions in HIV-infected patients. Limited data suggest that this&#xD;
      drug may be effective when given systemically, but is accompanied by a high incidence of side&#xD;
      effects. Administration of the drug topically onto the lesion should result in high local&#xD;
      concentrations within the lesion thereby suppressing tumor necrosis factor which is thought&#xD;
      to be related to the size and severity of the lesion. Subjects will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of three possible groups: systemic administration of thalidomide, topical administration&#xD;
      of thalidomide, and placebo. The dose of thalidomide will be determined in a dose escalation&#xD;
      pilot study prior to the main study. Healing, pain, and the incidence of side effects will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and weekly for up to eight weeks. Successful demonstration of an&#xD;
      enhanced therapeutic effect or reduced toxicity may provide a basis for the development of&#xD;
      novel routes of administration and drugs for the treatment of painful oral lesions associated&#xD;
      with HIV infection and other diseases.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons with HIV infection or acquired immunodeficiency of at least 18 years of age with&#xD;
        one or more chronic, painful intraoral lesions will constitute the study sample for both&#xD;
        studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be referred by a primary care physician who is managing their care, and must&#xD;
        have HIV/AIDS status confirmed and current CD4 status provided by the primary physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients' HIV treatment regimen will not be altered and those receiving highly active&#xD;
        antiretroviral therapy will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from participation if taking any concurrent treatment for mucosal&#xD;
        lesions (including topical or systemic steroids, viscous lidocaine, topical or systemic&#xD;
        anti-fungals, or mouthwashes), prior to concurrent thalidomide therapy, chemotherapy or&#xD;
        radiation therapy for neoplasms, concurrent acute therapy for opportunistic infection,&#xD;
        concurrent use of sedatives (such as CNS depressants or alcohol use), history of allergy to&#xD;
        thalidomide, pre-existing peripheral neuropathy of grade II or higher, and females of&#xD;
        childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or lactating females will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be between ages 40 to 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cannot be using prescription or non-prescription medications except birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Cannot have autoimmune conditions, such as diabetes, lupus, or HIV (must be healthy).&#xD;
&#xD;
