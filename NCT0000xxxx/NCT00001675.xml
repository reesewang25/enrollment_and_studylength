  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to learn more about the areas of the brain involved in the experience&#xD;
      of positive and negative emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who would like to participate in this study will first undergo a screening process&#xD;
      to see if they will be eligible for the study. Patients eligible to participate in the study&#xD;
      will go through two sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During session one, researchers will attempt to evoke positive and negative emotions by&#xD;
      showing patients slides of different emotion-arousing stimuli (pictures of pleasant and&#xD;
      unpleasant scenes). While patients are viewing these slides, researchers will be measuring&#xD;
      patient's heart rate, sweating, and eye-blinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During session two, patients will undergo an MRI of the brain while seeing similar&#xD;
      emotion-arousing pictures as in session one. In addition, patients may be asked to play a&#xD;
      simple computer game for a reward of money while researchers use the MRI to measure brain&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers hope to develop methods to evoke positive and negative emotions and&#xD;
      simultaneously (at the same time) see brain activation in normal volunteers, alcoholics, and&#xD;
      recovered alcoholics.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;

      Objective: The purpose of this protocol is two-fold: 1) to determine how individual&#xD;
      differences in evoked brain responses relate to generalized trait personality and behavior&#xD;
      differences (as assessed by psychometric questionnaire instruments and behavioral measures),&#xD;
      and 2) to determine whether individual differences in evoked brain responses relate&#xD;
      specifically to genetic polymorphisms in genes governing neurotransmitter activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy non-alcoholic adult volunteers, healthy adolescents aged 12 to 17&#xD;
      years (with or without a family history of alcohol use disorder), inpatient or outpatient&#xD;
      alcoholics, and recovering alcoholics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we will&#xD;
      attempt to evoke positive and negative affect via several different standardized methods&#xD;
      including: (1) pictures of emotion-arousing stimuli; (2) pictures of emotional facial&#xD;
      expression; (3) cues signaling reward or punishment. This protocol is designed to cover many&#xD;
      different functional magnetic imaging studies all using similar techniques to evoke and&#xD;
      measure positive and negative affect in the brain. Most subjects will not participate in&#xD;
      studies involving all the methods described in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The outcome measure is differences in blood oxygenation dependent level&#xD;
      (BOLD) signal measured using standard fMRI techniques and analyzed using AFNI software.&#xD;

               -  (1) Are physically healthy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (2) Are between 18-65 years of age (since age effects FMRI signal in ways that&#xD;
                  have not yet been well-characterized);&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  (1) Have ferromagnetic objects in their bodies which might be adversely affected&#xD;
                  by MRI including implanted pacemakers, medication pumps, aneurysm clips; metallic&#xD;
                  prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves or cochlear implants,&#xD;
                  shrapnel fragments, permanent eye liner or small metal fragments in the eye that&#xD;
                  welders and other metal works may have- any doubt about presence of these objects&#xD;
                  will result in exclusion from this study), or if candidates are uncomfortable in&#xD;

                  back for up to one hour;&#xD;
