    <textblock>
      This is a study to see if vitamin E helps children with epilepsy have fewer seizures. About&#xD;
      20-30% of children with epilepsy do not have adequate seizure control with established&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Other options for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy are newer&#xD;
      antiepileptic medications, ketogenic diet and surgery. However, a small percentage of&#xD;
      patients are candidates for these options. Therefore, additional treatments are needed to&#xD;
      improve seizure control in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. Animal studies have shown an&#xD;
      association between vitamin E supplementation and seizure reduction. A study in children also&#xD;
      showed that vitamin E helped reduce seizures. However, a similar study in adults did not show&#xD;
      a reduction in seizures with vitamin E supplementation. Therefore, this research study is&#xD;
      being done to help define vitamin E's usefulness and safety as a treatment for epilepsy.&#xD;
      Fifty patients will be recruited from the Children's Epilepsy Program at The Children's&#xD;
      Hospital in Denver, Colorado. Qualifying patients will have a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy&#xD;
      that is currently uncontrolled with standard AEDs. The study period is 6 months and includes&#xD;
      the following: Baseline period (1 month), Arm I (2 months), Wash-out period (1 month), and&#xD;
      Arm II (2 months). Patients must have been on the same AEDs for 2 months before enrollment.&#xD;
      All medications and complementary therapies must remain constant throughout the study. If at&#xD;
      any point the physician feels it is not best for the patient to continue the study they will&#xD;
      be discontinued. Before the study starts, study participants will be asked about seizure&#xD;
      activity, what they eat and about any complementary and/or alternative medicine they may use.&#xD;
      The study is two phases. Study participants will be given either vitamin E or placebo (fake&#xD;
      pill/liquid) in each phase of the study. They will receive both vitamin E and placebo during&#xD;
      the study. Which phase they receive vitamin E and placebo will be decided by chance (similar&#xD;
      to rolling dice). Study participants will take liquid vitamin E or placebo two times per day.&#xD;
      The study participants and study doctors will not know who is taking vitamin E and who is&#xD;
      taking placebo. Study participants will come to the hospital for 3 outpatient and 2 inpatient&#xD;
      visits. Health-related quality of life questionnaires will be filled out and blood will be&#xD;
      drawn at three of the visits. Seizure diaries will be maintained throughout the study.&#xD;
