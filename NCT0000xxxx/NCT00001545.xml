      This study is designed to evaluate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a&#xD;
      potential treatment for depression. In rTMS, a rapidly changing magnetic field passes through&#xD;
      your scalp and skull and generates a small electrical pulses in your brain. rTMS at lower&#xD;
      intensities has helped some people with depression but we do not know what the results will&#xD;
      be in your case using higher intensities, or whether you will be randomized to 3 weeks of&#xD;
      high frequency (20 cycles er second), low frequency (1 cycle per second), or inactive&#xD;
      (sham)rTMS. You will be assigned to receive one of these types of rTMS over the left front&#xD;
      art of your brain five times per week for the three weeks. Each rTMS treatment session should&#xD;
      take between 20-30 minutes of actual stimulation, but weekly ratings, memory testing, and&#xD;
      blood sampling may require several hours per week. We will also ask you to have brain imaging&#xD;
      procedures to see if these will predict response to high vs. low frequency rTMS. If you are&#xD;
      randomized to the 3 weeks of sham rTMS, you will have the opportunity to receive one of the&#xD;
      active stimulation frequencies for an additional 3 weeks. Responders to any phase will be&#xD;
      offered an additional month of rTMS prior to study termination and recommendations of&#xD;
      alternative treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new technique for activating the&#xD;
      brain noninvasively through the scalp and skull. It has proven effective in producing&#xD;
      localized effects on brain function and has opened many areas of human brain function to&#xD;
      direct investigation. Preliminary data also suggest potential therapeutic applications in&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric illness. We plan to further investigate the possible therapeutic use of rTMS&#xD;
      in depression under conditions of high frequency (20 Hz), low (1Hz) frequency, and sham and&#xD;
      to also examine possible cognitive or endocrine effects. Among the priorities of this&#xD;
      protocol will be to further evaluate the risks of the technique.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will receive a psychiatric and physical examination by a qualified physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be from 18 to 90 years of age and must give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unipolar patients must be medication free to participate. Patients with bipolar disorder&#xD;
        depression may be medication-free or on any combination (including monotherapy) of lithium,&#xD;
        carbamazepine, and valproate. Inpatient monitoring will be provided when medically&#xD;
        indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Reasons for exclusion will be the presence of cardiac pacemakers, medication pumps,&#xD;
        cochlear implants or metal objects in the head or eyes that could be dangerous if heated or&#xD;
        moved by the magnetic pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General contraindications to rTMS or a current diagnosis of alcohol or substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects having serious medical illnesses or meeting current psychoactive substance&#xD;
        dependence will be excluded from entry.&#xD;
