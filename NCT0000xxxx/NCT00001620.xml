      This study allows the evaluation of subjects in order to determine their ability to safely&#xD;
      participate in other active research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects complete the screening process, they will be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in an active research study, or if no appropriate studies are available&#xD;
      information and recommendations will be provided for other treatment options....&#xD;

      This protocol is designed for screening of subjects before a decision can be made as to their&#xD;
      eligibility for one of the active National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) research&#xD;
      protocols. Its purpose is to allow detailed investigation into the hematologic or oncologic&#xD;
      problems of these subjects, and the status of other organ systems that would determine their&#xD;
      ability to safely tolerate specific aspects of active research protocols. It allows&#xD;
      investigation as to whether a donor is HLA matched, fit to receive G-CSF, and fit to undergo&#xD;
      apheresis and therefore eligible to participate as a donor on a bone marrow transplant&#xD;
      protocol. It also allows the investigation as to whether subjects are eligible for&#xD;
      participation as normal volunteer based on protocol eligibility criteria that requires&#xD;
      generally good health status by history or physical exam findings, or laboratory assessments.&#xD;
      After completion of this screening process, the subject will either be offered a chance to&#xD;
      participate in an active research protocol, or if no appropriate protocol is identified,&#xD;
      subjects with hematologic or oncologic disease will have recommendations for other treatment&#xD;
      options relayed to the primary or referring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to determine subject eligibility for participation on NHLBI protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is the results of clinical, imaging and laboratory assessments.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be entered on this protocol at the time of their first visit to the NIH&#xD;
        Clinical Center outpatient clinic or inpatient service if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject carries the diagnosis of a disorder for which the NHLBI has an active research&#xD;
        protocol, and based on information received from an outside physician, he/she appears to&#xD;
        meet at least preliminary eligibility criteria for that protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject is a donor for a subject for which the NHLBI has an active stem cell transplant&#xD;
        protocol and based on information received from an outside physician, he/she appears to&#xD;
        meet preliminary eligibility as a donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject is a normal volunteer for which the NHLBI has an active study recruiting&#xD;
        healthy normal volunteers and he/she appears to meet preliminary eligibility as a normal&#xD;
        volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 2 and Weight greater than 12 kg. (Healthy Volunteer age&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 8)&#xD;

        authorized representative (LAR) is capable of informed consent, and willing to sign the&#xD;
        consent form after initial counseling by clinical staff. Separate consent forms for all&#xD;
        interventional or surgical procedures will be obtained after explanation of the specific&#xD;
        procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
