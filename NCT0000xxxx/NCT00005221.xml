      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal designs are frequently encountered in epidemiologic research, particularly in&#xD;
      the cardiopulmonary field. Many different statistical models have been proposed for the&#xD;
      analysis of longitudinal data in the statistical literature. These include the general linear&#xD;
      model, autoregressive models, random effects models, and simple models based on an analysis&#xD;
      of slopes over time. Complex models are not widely used in the epidemiologic literature, due&#xD;
      mainly to a lack of understanding of their underlying utility and the types of questions that&#xD;
      could be answered with complex models that cannot be addressed using simple models. An&#xD;
      additional problem is a lack of software available for fitting complex models. The study has&#xD;
      important public health implications, since longitudinal data continue to accumulate rapidly&#xD;
      and no guidelines are available as to the appropriate methods of analysis for specific&#xD;
      research questions. Furthermore, it is often only through the modelling of longitudinal data&#xD;
      that processes pertaining to change can be understood. The original aim of the study was to&#xD;
      perform a comparative study of statistical models on datasets from nine large epidemiological&#xD;
      studies in the cardiopulmonary field in order to develop tools for identifying appropriate&#xD;
      classes of statistical models for use in analyzing longitudinal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study define new national norms for pediatric blood pressure by adjusting the&#xD;
      available data set of over 60,000 pediatric blood pressure readings for age, height and&#xD;
      gender among children of normal body weight. It has been increasingly accepted that there is&#xD;
      a long-term correlation between blood pressure in childhood and adulthood. Hence, it is&#xD;
      significant to monitor childhood blood pressure. The 90th and 95th percentiles of blood&#xD;
      pressure for specific age, sex and height groups were presented in the Update for the 1987&#xD;
      Task Force Report on Blood Pressure control in children, arid widely distributed by the&#xD;
      National High Blood Pressure Education Program. There has been a recent update to the Task&#xD;
      Force Report (Pediatrics, 2004) which used more current height percentiles based on Center&#xD;
      for Disease Control and Prevention (2000) growth charts and extends the percentiles provided&#xD;
      to include the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles. However, the percentiles are based on&#xD;
      all children including both obese and non-obese children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nine datasets used included: for pulmonary data, the Childhood Respiratory Disease Study,&#xD;
      the Netherlands data from Vlagtwedde and Vlaardingen, the Boston Police Study, the Fletcher&#xD;
      Study data from England; for cardiopulmonary data, the Veterans Administration Normative&#xD;
      Aging Study; for blood pressure data, the Wales Study, the Zinner/Kass Study, the Lee/Zinner&#xD;
      Study, and the East Boston Childhood Blood Pressure Study. For each of the nine datasets the&#xD;
      following models were fitted and compared for adults, children, and for adults and children&#xD;
      combined: autoregressive models both serial-correlation and state-dependence; random-effects&#xD;
      models; regression models with intraclass correlation structure; general linear models;&#xD;
      models based on fitting slopes to individual persons. New methods for analyzing longitudinal&#xD;
      data were developed and included fitting of higher-order autoregressive models with unequally&#xD;
      spaced data, nonparametric methods, familial and other clustering effects in the analysis of&#xD;
      longitudinal pulmonary function data, robust methods, empirical Bayes methods for estimation&#xD;
      of slopes, and hierarchial models based on old and new methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 1996 to perform a comparative study of complex models on datasets&#xD;
      from four large epidemiologic studies in the cardiopulmonary field. The models were compared&#xD;
      as regards goodness of fit, ease of implementation, and interpretability. In addition, new&#xD;
      statistical methods were developed to model phenomena which seemed poorly-fitted by existing&#xD;
      models, including adult longitudinal bp and pulmonary function data. The overall goal was to&#xD;
      develop tools for identifying appropriate classes of longitudinal statistical models. This&#xD;
      has important public health implications, since longitudinal data continue to accumulate&#xD;
      rapidly and no guidelines exist as to appropriate methods of analysis. Furthermore, it is&#xD;
      often only through modelling of longitudinal data rather than through cross-sectional or&#xD;
      separate two time-point analyses that underlying processes pertaining to change can be&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in February 2000 to extend and enhance several techniques in the&#xD;
      analyses of longitudinal data frequently encountered in epidemiological studies. The&#xD;
      techniques include: methods for control for time-dependent confounding in epidemiological&#xD;
      studies; developing an incidence model for benign breast disease using the Nurses' Health&#xD;
      Study; analysis of incomplete longitudinal data from the Normative Aging Study; extending the&#xD;
      penalized likelihood procedures for quantile regression to the repeated measures setting; and&#xD;
      development of methods to estimate correlated ROC curves to measure the predictive accuracy&#xD;
      of GEE regression models for longitudinal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 2005 to define new national norms for pediatric blood pressure by&#xD;
      adjusting the available data set of over 60,000 pediatric blood pressure readings for age,&#xD;
      height and gender among children of normal body weight. The study will (a) broaden the&#xD;
      percentiles presented so as to display the full range of blood pressure percentiles from the&#xD;
      first to the 99th percentile (b) evaluate the percentiles for children of normal body weight&#xD;
      so as to disentangle the relationship between hypertension and obesity (c) provide a&#xD;
      algorithm using Microsoft Access for computation of a blood pressure percentile or Z-score in&#xD;
      a user-friendly format (d) provide percentiles for both K4 and K5 diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (the Task Force Report only includes percentiles for K5 DBF) and (e) compare childhood blood&#xD;
      pressure percentiles by ethnic group. The study will also develop screening rules for&#xD;
      detecting high blood pressure in children. Given the existence of new Task Force Norms that&#xD;
      quantify percentile values of blood pressure in children by age, sex and height, an&#xD;
      significant issue is how to use these norms to effectively screen children for high blood&#xD;
      pressure, where high blood pressure is defined as having an average blood pressure &gt; 95'&#xD;
      percentile for a given age, sex and height based on task force percentiles over a large&#xD;
      number of visits. The goal is to develop efficient screening rules that maximize accuracy&#xD;
      with the fewest screening visits necessary per child. The screening rules will be assessed in&#xD;
      simulation studies and tested in a sample of 16,000 Houston school children who were screened&#xD;
      for high blood pressure&#xD;
