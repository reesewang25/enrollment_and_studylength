    <textblock>
      Bone marrow transplants (BMT) are one of the accepted therapies used to treat leukemia.&#xD;
      However, BMT have risks of complications. One potentially life-threatening complication is&#xD;
      known as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GVHD is a reaction caused by an incompatibility between donor cells and recipient cells.&#xD;
      Antigens found on the recipient s cells are recognized by the donor s transplanted white&#xD;
      blood cell lymphocytes. These lymphocytes begin attacking the recipient s cells and tissues&#xD;
      and may lead to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most effective ways to prevent this reaction is to remove the lymphocytes from the&#xD;
      transplanted marrow. Unfortunately, without lymphocytes the recipient s immune system will be&#xD;
      lowered and may result in a relapse of leukemia or an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have shown they can perform effective BMT by removing the lymphocytes prior to&#xD;
      the transplant and then later adding the lymphocytes back. This technique can reduce the&#xD;
      potential for GVHD and preserve the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect of the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers plan to use peripheral blood with lymphocytes removed rather than&#xD;
      bone marrow. In order to increase the number of progenitor cells, the cells responsible for&#xD;
      correcting the leukemia, donors will receive doses of G-CSF prior to the transplant. G-CSF&#xD;
      (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) is a growth factor that increases the production of&#xD;
      progenitor cells in the donor s blood stream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be broken into two parts. The first part of the study will attempt to&#xD;
      determine if peripheral blood with lymphocytes removed can prevent GVHD while preserving the&#xD;
      GVL effect of the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study, patients that received the transplant will have the&#xD;
      lymphocytes added-back on two separate occasions in order reduce the chances of relapse and&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to treat up to 55 patients ages 10 to 60 years and follow their&#xD;
      progress for 5 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One of the most effective ways of preventing lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for leukemia is to remove T-lymphocytes from the&#xD;
      transplanted marrow. The reduced early mortality from T cell depletion is however offset by&#xD;
      an increased risk of leukemic relapse and infection. We have shown that bone marrow&#xD;
      transplants for leukemia depleted of T cells by elutriation and followed by delayed add-back&#xD;
      of donor T cells reduces GVHD while preserving an immune response to the hematologic&#xD;
      malignancy (the so-called graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) or graft-versus-myeloma effect). The&#xD;
      study highlighted a possible benefit of large doses of marrow progenitor cells on transplant&#xD;
      outcome. GVHD was reduced but not prevented by T cell depletion of the marrow. The first&#xD;
      objective of our BMT studies is to prevent GVHD from the transplant while conserving GVL&#xD;
      reactivity. This is a prerequisite to our second objective of determining the risk of GVHD&#xD;
      and the benefit from GVL from add-back of donor lymphocytes. These studies will provide the&#xD;
      basis for a planned trial adding back donor lymphocytes selected in vitro to confer immunity&#xD;
      against infectious agents and residual leukemia without causing GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will evaluate the use of T cell depleted peripheral blood progenitor cells&#xD;
      (PBPC) (instead of bone marrow) to optimize the stem cell and lymphocyte dose. Donors will be&#xD;
      given G-CSF and their mobilized PBPC harvested by leukapheresis. To minimize acute GVHD, the&#xD;
      transplant will be T cell depleted, using a new technique developed in normal volunteers&#xD;
      which improves T cell depletion and reduces stem cell loss (protocol 96-H-0049). The study&#xD;
      has two phases: The first phase evaluates engraftment and GVHD following T cell depleted PBPC&#xD;
      transplants. Stopping rules will be used to make modifications to the protocol in the event&#xD;
      of graft failure. Cyclosporine will be withdrawn from the protocol if the incidence of acute&#xD;
      GVHD is low or absent. In the second phase patients will receive add-back of donor&#xD;
      lymphocytes on day 45 and day 100 post transplant to prevent relapse and confer donor-immune&#xD;
      function. The risk of acute GVHD following this procedure will be determined. It is planned&#xD;
      to treat up to 55 patients aged between 10 and 60 years. The end points of the study are&#xD;
      graft take; acute and chronic GVHD, leukemic relapse, transplant-related and all causes of&#xD;
      mortality, cytomegalovirus reactivation and leukemia-free survival. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      for 5 years.&#xD;
