      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the consumption of trans-fatty acids or hydrogenated fat has consistently been shown&#xD;
      to elevate concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol, the effects on HDL-c and Lp(a) are&#xD;
      inconsistent, especially when the fats were consumed at moderate levels. In addition, little&#xD;
      is known about the mechanisms by which trans-fatty acids increase total and LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      levels or how they may alter the atherogenecity of lipoprotein subfractions. The study&#xD;
      interventions employ commonly used hydrogenated fats with a wide range of trans-fatty acid&#xD;
      levels (1.5-9.8 percent). The impact will be assessed within the guidelines currently&#xD;
      recommended for individuals with moderately elevated plasma levels for which dietary&#xD;
      modification is often the first approach to treatment. The results of the study may lead to&#xD;
      improved public health recommendations concerning trans-fatty acid and hydrogenated fat&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty subjects (20 male, 20 female) ages 50 or older, with LDL cholesterol concentrations&#xD;
      greater than 130 mg/dl were fed each of five diets for eight week periods. The baseline diet&#xD;
      consisted of 36 percent of energy as fat (15 percent saturated, 15 percent monosaturated, 6&#xD;
      percent polyunsaturated) and 160 mg cholesterol/1000 kcal. The experimental diets contained&#xD;
      30 percent energy as fat, 2/3 of which was derived from each of the following: 1)&#xD;
      unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, 2) soybean oil margarine in tub form, 3) commercial&#xD;
      shortening, and 4) butter in a randomized double blind, cross-over design. With the exception&#xD;
      of the experimental fat, all other foods in the reduced fat diets were identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study assessed the impact of consuming diets enriched in hydrogenated and other fats on&#xD;
      a) plasma lipids and lipoprotein concentrations, b) apolipoproteins A-1 and B and Lp(a)&#xD;
      concentrations, c) parameters related to HDL cholesterol [particle size, composition,&#xD;
      subfraction distribution (HDL2 and HDL3, and HDL with and without A-II)], d) susceptibility&#xD;
      of LDL to oxidation, e) activities of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and&#xD;
      cholesterol ester transfer protein, and f) rates of endogenous cholesterol synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in FY 2000 is to assess the impact of newer approaches to dietary&#xD;
      modification with the intent of reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The&#xD;
      specific aims of the study are as follow: 1) to assess the impact of substituting two classes&#xD;
      of fats specifically formulated to substitute for hydrogenated fats (i.e., trans-free&#xD;
      margarines and genetically modified/selectively bred oils) on serum lipid levels (total,&#xD;
      VLDL, LDL, HDL, HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol; triglyceride; apo A-l and B; Lp[a]), immune&#xD;
      function, and prostaglandin levels, and 2) to address unresolved issues related to plant&#xD;
      sterols, including the relative efficacy of currently available preparations, impact of the&#xD;
      fat and cholesterol content of the diet, and effect of dosing frequency on serum lipids,&#xD;
      endogenous cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol absorption, and fat soluble vitamin levels.&#xD;
      Study subjects are older (50-75 y) hypercholesterolemic female and male subjects (LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol 130-160 mg/dl). Each 5-week diet phase will be scheduled in randomized order; all&#xD;
      food and drink will be provided. In Part 1, Study 1, subjects will consume each of 3 diets&#xD;
      (30 percent fat [2/3 experimental fat], 80 mg cholesterol/1000 kcal) with the following&#xD;
      experimental fats: conventional soft margarine; trans-free margarine (interesterified palm&#xD;
      kernel + liquid oil); trans-free margarine (fully hydrogenated soybean oil + liquid oil). In&#xD;
      Part 1, Study 2, subjects will consume each of 6 diets (as above) with the following&#xD;
      experimental fats: hydrogenated soybean (shortening), high oleic sunflower, high oleic&#xD;
      soybean, high oleic canola, low saturated soybean and low linolenic soybean oils. In Part 2,&#xD;
      Study 1, subjects will consume each of 4 diets (38 percent fat [15 percent SFA, 14 percent&#xD;
      MUFA, 6 percent PUFA], 200 mg cholesterol/1000 kcal), baseline and the following: sitostanol&#xD;
      ester; sitostenol ester, and genetically modified high sterol oil. In Part 2, Study 2,&#xD;
      subjects will consume each of 4 plant sterol enriched diets, high fat (as above) with high&#xD;
      (200 mg) or low (80 mg) cholesterol/1000 kcal, and low fat (20 percent fat [5 percent SFA,&#xD;
      7.5 percent MUFA, 7.5 percent PUFA]) with high or low cholesterol. In Part 2, Study 3, the&#xD;
      effect of dosing regime will be assessed using the most efficacious plant sterol as&#xD;
      identified in Study 1 and diet as in Study 2 (single bolus or in 3 divided doses).&#xD;
