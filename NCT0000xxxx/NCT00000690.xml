  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate how the drug dextran sulfate (DS) is absorbed by the stomach and intestines when&#xD;
      taken by mouth. To evaluate its effect on blood coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DS has been reported to have anti-HIV activity. However, it is not known how much of the drug&#xD;
      is absorbed into the bloodstream and can be used by the body when DS is taken by mouth.&#xD;

      DS has been reported to have anti-HIV activity. However, it is not known how much of the drug&#xD;
      is absorbed into the bloodstream and can be used by the body when DS is taken by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 2nd day of hospitalization, each volunteer receives an oral dose of DS. Over the next 24&#xD;
      hours, 15 blood samples are obtained (from 15 separate needle sticks). On 4th day, each&#xD;
      volunteer is given an injection of DS into vein. 18 blood samples are obtained. Blood is&#xD;
      withdrawn before the infusion, at the end of the infusion, and 30 and 60 minutes after the&#xD;
      infusion. All urine is collected.&#xD;
