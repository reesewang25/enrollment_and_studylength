    <textblock>
      Non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), the most common cause of acute optic nerve&#xD;
      disease in older persons, causes permanent and severe visual loss. Visual function can be&#xD;
      impaired through decreased central visual acuity or peripheral field loss, or both. NAION&#xD;
      strikes both eyes in up to 40 percent of affected patients. The incidence of NAION has been&#xD;
      estimated at 2.3 per 100,000 persons over the age of 50 years and 0.54 per 100,000 for all&#xD;
      ages. Estimates of the number of new cases seen each year in the United States range from a&#xD;
      low of approximately 1,500 to a high of 6,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAION has been hypothesized to be caused by vascular insufficiency leading to optic nerve&#xD;
      head ischemia. There is general agreement that NAION results from transient non-perfusion of&#xD;
      nutrient vessels. The wide range of visual field defects and visual loss with NAION can be&#xD;
      explained by the extent and number of the blood vessels involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical factors appear to contribute to the vascular event initiating NAION. Clinically,&#xD;
      the number of discs congenitally lacking a physiological cup in eyes with NAION is higher&#xD;
      than expected. Presumably, in eyes with NAION, these discs have small scleral openings that&#xD;
      crowd the nerve fibers as they pass through the restricted space in the optic disc and lamina&#xD;
      cribrosa, thereby predisposing to an ischemic spiral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One current theory holds that NAION begins as a minor ischemic event that later progresses to&#xD;
      a major infarction due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves. The inciting ischemic event&#xD;
      leads to local anterior nerve edema, and this causes further ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optic nerve sheath decompression surgery was reported in 1989 to be of benefit to patients&#xD;
      with NAION. The presumed mechanism of action in optic nerve decompression surgery revolved&#xD;
      around restoration of impaired blood flow to the optic nerve through reduction of the&#xD;
      pressure around the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT) was a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      designed to compare the improvements in visual acuity at 6 months in patients assigned to&#xD;
      receive surgery with optic nerve sheath decompression with those assigned to careful&#xD;
      followup. A cohort of patients, with a baseline visual acuity of better than 20/64 are also&#xD;
      being followed to better understand the natural history of the disease, including second eye&#xD;
      involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment began in October 1992. Randomization was stratified by clinic, and patients had an&#xD;
      equal probability of assignment to surgery or careful followup. All patients are being&#xD;
      followed for a minimum of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is a change of three lines or more in visual acuity at the 6-month&#xD;
      followup visit compared with visual acuity measured at the randomization visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include a change in visual acuity beyond 6 months, change in peripheral&#xD;
      visual function as measured by automated Humphrey perimetry, local and systemic side effects&#xD;
      from treatment, change in quality of life, and other associated morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
