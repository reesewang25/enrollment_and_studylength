  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized Phase III trial of FLAC chemotherapy with GM-CSF versus&#xD;
      PIXY321 in advanced breast cancer. The primary endpoints of this study will be the duration&#xD;
      of thrombocytopenia and the time to recovery of platelets to 50,000/microliters. Other&#xD;
      clinical endpoints will include the depth and duration of leukopenia, neutropenia, and&#xD;
      anemia, the platelet and RBC transfusion requirements, and the number of documented instances&#xD;
      of sepsis and hospitalizations for fever and neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory correlates will include the detailed evaluation of the effects on circulating&#xD;
      hematopoietic progenitor cells by GM-CSF and PIXY321 and the potential effects these agents&#xD;
      have on the bone marrow micro-environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5 cycles of FLAC with GM-CSF versus PIXY321, patients will be treated with 5 cycles of&#xD;
      96 hour infusional taxol. The goal of this part of the study will be to assess the toxicity&#xD;
      and feasibility of administering infusional taxol following dose-intensive FLAC chemotherapy.&#xD;

        Patients with Stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer who have a histologically-proven&#xD;
        diagnosis. Measurable, evaluable Stage III patients, Stage II patients with 4 or more nodes&#xD;
        positive, and Stage IV NED (no evidence of disease) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had prior radiation therapy providing there was not more than 20% of the&#xD;
        bone marrow has been irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received less than or equal to 360mg/m2 of Adriamycin as adjuvant&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be previously untreated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There must be no history of previous malignancy except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
        (basal or squamous cell carcinoma), cervical cancer in situ, or a past malignancy that has&#xD;
        been inactive for over 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance status (Karnofsky scale) must be greater than 70; ECOG 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute granulocyte count greater than 1500 microliters and platelet count greater than&#xD;
        100,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Liver function tests (SGOT, and total bilirubin) should be less than 2X the upper limits of&#xD;
        normal unless there is evidence of hepatic involvement with tumor. Serum creatinine should&#xD;
        be less than 1.7 or creatinine clearance should be greater than 45 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;

        adequate follow-up for the period the protocol requires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who are poor medical or psychiatric risks because of nonmalignant systemic&#xD;
        disease which would preclude them from being subjected to any treatments in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not currently require therapy for cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart&#xD;
        failure, or coronary artery disease. Patients who have received prior Adriamycin or have&#xD;
        any history of cardiac disease must have a LVEF greater than 45 percent by MUGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
