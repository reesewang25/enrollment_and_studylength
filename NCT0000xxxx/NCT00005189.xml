      To determine whether the degree of carotid artery atherosclerosis, as measured by B-mode&#xD;
      ultrasound, predicts the development of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality in patients with angiographically defined coronary status. Also, to quantify the&#xD;
      rate of progression of carotid artery disease and to evaluate the risk factors associated&#xD;
      with progression of carotid atherosclerosis.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although angiographic evidence of coronary atherosclerosis is one of the best predictors of&#xD;
      clinical events, non-invasive imaging of this arterial bed is not yet possible. The&#xD;
      availability of non-invasive methods for imaging the carotid arteries, and the&#xD;
      intra-individual similarity of extent of disease in the coronary and carotid arteries&#xD;
      provides rationale for this study that assesses the usefulness of B-mode ultrascan evaluation&#xD;
      of extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis as an independent predictor of clinical&#xD;
      sequelae such as fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot data from an ongoing case-comparison study of risk factors for coronary and carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerosis as defined by angiography and B-mode ultrasound provided a background for&#xD;
      this project. Patients from the pilot study were used in this study. Beginning in 1986,&#xD;
      traditional risk factors such as lipids, lipoproteins, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking&#xD;
      were measured as were non-traditional risk factors such as apolipoproteins and genetic&#xD;
      markers. The cohort was followed for 3.5 to 8.5 years for incidence of clinical events.&#xD;
      Multivariate techniques were used to relate disease or risk factor status to all-cause&#xD;
      mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal and non-fatal stroke. The&#xD;
      same subjects were re-evaluated periodically by B-mode for extent of carotid atherosclerosis.&#xD;
      A fifty percent random sample of patients positive for both cerebrovascular disease and&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and a fifty percent random sample of patients negative for both&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease had repeat B-mode measurements at 2.5&#xD;
      years. All patients surviving at the end of five years had repeat B-mode scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 1996 through April 1999 to conduct a longitudinal study testing the&#xD;
      following hypotheses: 1.) Incidence of cardiovascular events (bypass surgery, angioplasty,&#xD;
      fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke and endarterectomy) in men and women&#xD;
      with extensive carotid wall thickening (CWT) at baseline exceeds that of those with less&#xD;
      extensive baseline carotid wall thickening; the relation of carotid wall thickening to&#xD;
      outcome is independent of coronary artery disease and/or coronary artery disease risk&#xD;
      factors; and, 2.) carotid wall thickening progresses more rapidly in males and females with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and/or coronary artery disease risk factors than in coronary artery&#xD;
      disease/risk factor free controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to: 1) follow-up a cohort of 670 individuals with defined coronary&#xD;
      anatomy, extent of carotid wall thickening, and coronary artery disease risk factors over&#xD;
      5-10 years for fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. Coronary artery disease, carotid&#xD;
      wall thickening, and coronary artery disease risk factor status at accession will be related&#xD;
      to outcome; and, 2.) In a separate (new) cohort of 280 volunteers with and without coronary&#xD;
      artery disease they will evaluate carotid wall thickening yearly for three years, and use&#xD;
      multivariable analysis to relate accession status to progression rate. Availability of a&#xD;
      unique sample of patients largely already characterized for coronary status (at angiography),&#xD;
      coronary artery disease risk factors, and carotid wall thickening, and development of B-mode&#xD;
      methods for quantifying carotid wall thickening and biostatistical approaches for quantifying&#xD;
      progression of carotid wall thickening over a short time span (three years) provide&#xD;
      opportunity for this project. Recent pilot data support its feasibility.&#xD;
