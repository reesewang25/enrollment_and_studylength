      To assess the safety and tolerance of multiple oral doses of 141W94 alone, in combination&#xD;
      with 1592U89, and in combination with Retrovir and Epivir, administered to patients with HIV&#xD;
      infection as measured by the development of clinical adverse experiences and laboratory test&#xD;
      abnormalities. To determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 141W94 alone and in&#xD;
      combination with 1592U89 after multiple oral dosing. To obtain preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      antiretroviral activity of 141W94 alone and in combination with 1592U89, the antiretroviral&#xD;
      effect of combined Retrovir/Epivir and the antiretroviral effect of 141W94 when added to&#xD;
      Retrovir/Epivir or to 1592U89/Retrovir/Epivir.&#xD;

      60 HIV-infected patients will be sequentially assigned to receive 1 of 5 doses of 141W94&#xD;
      alone or 141W94 plus 1592U89. After each patient has completed 4 weeks of the assigned&#xD;
      regimen (Phase A), the patient will receive Epivir and Retrovir for up to 8 months (Phase B).&#xD;
      Patients originally assigned, in Phase A, to receive 141W94 and 1592U89 continue to receive&#xD;
      1592U89 during this period. Upon termination of Phase B, 141W94 is added to existing regimens&#xD;
      of Phase B (Phase C). Phase C will last for 12 weeks.&#xD;
