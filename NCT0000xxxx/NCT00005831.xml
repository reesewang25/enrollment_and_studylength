  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining trastuzumab with combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy in treating patients who have locally recurrent or metastatic urinary tract&#xD;
      cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them&#xD;
      or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity of the combination of Herceptin, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and&#xD;
      gemcitabine in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent urothelial cancers who&#xD;
      overexpress HER2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The complete and partial response rates. II. The median and overall survival. III. To&#xD;
      prospectively evaluate the percentage of patients with metastatic/recurrent bladder cancer&#xD;
      who overexpress HER2 histologically (by immunohistochemistry and FISH) and serologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To generate preliminary data on response to other therapy and survival for Her2 negative&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15;&#xD;
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 15 minutes on day 1; and gemcitabine IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks. Patients achieving a complete&#xD;
      response (CR) receive 3 courses past CR. Patients achieving a partial response or stable&#xD;
      disease continue on therapy until CR or disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for disease progression and survival. Patients with HER2-negative&#xD;
      disease are not eligible for treatment but are followed every 6 months for response and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;

               -  If the available tissue is from the primary tumor and is HER2 negative and if the&#xD;
                  serum is negative, to qualify for the study a biopsy of a metastatic site should&#xD;
                  be done and the patient will be eligible ONLY if this demonstrates HER2&#xD;
                  over-expression&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All sites and measurements of disease must be clearly documented in the pre-study&#xD;
                  forms&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All prior local or adjuvant systemic therapy including the type of chemotherapy&#xD;
                  must be clearly documented in the pre-study form Note: Patients with Her-2&#xD;
                  negative tumors are not eligible for treatment on this protocol but their&#xD;
                  response to other therapy and survival will also be evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bidimensionally measurable or evaluable disease not previously radiated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease; patients may have received&#xD;

             fraction &gt;= 50% or higher than the lower limit of institutional normal) as determined&#xD;
             by a MUGA scan or 2-D echocardiogram within 4 weeks from registration, and no evidence&#xD;
             of symptomatic coronary artery disease (baseline EKG must show no active ischemia);&#xD;
             patients must not have history of congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients have received prior radiation therapy, disease must be present outside of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
