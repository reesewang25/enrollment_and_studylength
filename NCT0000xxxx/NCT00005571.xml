    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the experimental drug h5G1.1-mAb in&#xD;
      treating patients with dermatomyositis. This disease, which causes skin rash, muscle&#xD;
      weakness, and sometimes various other symptoms, may be due to an immune system abnormality.&#xD;
      Drugs currently used to treat dermatomyositis, such as prednisone and various anticancer&#xD;
      drugs, often have serious side effects and may not work in all patients. h5G1.1-mAb is a&#xD;
      genetically engineered antibody that blocks the activity of certain proteins involved in the&#xD;
      immune reaction that produces inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients age 18 years and older who have had dermatomyositis for at least 6 months and who&#xD;
      have not improved with prednisone or other therapies, or who cannot tolerate prednisone or&#xD;
      other therapies, may be eligible for this 12-week study. Candidates will have a history and&#xD;
      physical examination, including blood and urine tests, throat culture, and muscle strength&#xD;
      testing. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either h5G1.1-mAb or placebo (an&#xD;
      inactive substance). The drug or placebo will be given intravenously (through a thin tube&#xD;
      inserted into a vein) once a week for five doses and then every other week for two more&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following additional tests at various intervals during the&#xD;
      study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete physical examination ( visit 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood and urine tests (various intervals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Muscle strength testing, assessment of ability to perform daily tasks, and completion of&#xD;
           questionnaire regarding functional abilities (visits 2, 6 and 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ultrasound imaging of muscle (during certain muscle exercises) (visits 2, 6 and 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Electrocardiogram (EKG) (visits 2 and 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Throat swab (culture) (visit 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Examination and photography of skin lesions (visits 2 and 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Skin biopsy - removal of small sample of skin tissue under local anesthetic (visits 2&#xD;
           and 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of muscles (visits 2 and 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Possible muscle biopsy - removal of small sample of muscle tissue under local anesthetic&#xD;
           (visits 2 and 9).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, third-party, placebo-controlled pilot study of h5G1.1-mAb, an antibody&#xD;
      directed at the complement component C5, administered to patients with dermatomyositis with&#xD;
      persistent disease. We are one of the four groups taking part in a multicenter trial under&#xD;
      the sponsorship of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dermatomytosis, humorally-mediated damage to muscle and skin microvasculature appears very&#xD;
      important. The deposition of the membrane attack complex (C5-9) on the capillaries has been&#xD;
      shown to precede the destruction of muscle fibers and to be a specific finding in the skin&#xD;
      lesion. These observations, along with the recent discovery of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) in dermatomyositis, support the role of complement&#xD;
      activation in the pathogenesis of dermatomyositis. Among the activated components of the&#xD;
      complement system, the products that are generated after cleavage of C5, namely, C5a and&#xD;
      C5b-9, are potent inflammatory mediators with pleiotropic activities. Inhibition of&#xD;
      complement activation at C5 would prevent the formation of these pro-inflammatory molecules&#xD;
      while allowing the generation of C3b, which is critical for opsonization and immune complex&#xD;
      clearance. C5 inhibition therefore represents a potentially effective therapeutic modality&#xD;
      for dermatomyositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-C5 monoclonal antibodies are designed to prevent the cleavage of C5. A murine monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody to human C5, m5G1.1-mAb, was humanized (h5G1.1-mAb) by grafting the antibody's&#xD;
      antigen-binding CDR regions onto human antibody-derived framework and constant domains. This&#xD;
      antibody is being made available by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and will be used under their&#xD;
      IND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 15 patients entered (with the goal of 12 evaluable patients) distributed among&#xD;
      two treatment groups. Patients will be randomized at a 3 to 1 ratio between h5G1.1-mAb and&#xD;
      placebo. Following a screening period of no less than 7 days, a 2 month double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized treatment period will commence. Patients will receive an active (h5G1.1-mAb,&#xD;
      8mg/kg) bolus infusion every week X 5, then every 2 weeks X 2, or a placebo bolus infusion&#xD;
      every week X 5, then every 2 weeks X 2. All patients will be receiving 7 infusions of&#xD;
      h5G1.1-mAb or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of h5G1.1-mAb and to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this antibody as well as its efficacy in the target&#xD;
      population. Safety will be assessed via the collection of adverse events and the evaluation&#xD;
      of pre- and post-treatment laboratory data. Efficacy will be assessed by the change in the&#xD;
      manual muscle testing score relative to placebo at 2.25 months (one week following the end of&#xD;
      the active treatment period) (primary efficacy value), and the change in the muscle enzyme&#xD;
      level, MRI findings, skin examination findings and biopsy, and SF-36 (secondary efficacy&#xD;
      values).&#xD;
