  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if intravenous (IV) and oral zidovudine (AZT) can be safely given to children&#xD;
      aged 1 day to 3 months who were born to mothers with an HIV infection. Also to determine the&#xD;
      correct dose of AZT for young children. Of a total of 908 pediatric AIDS cases, 78 percent&#xD;
      have acquired HIV infection from a mother with HIV infection or at high risk for acquisition&#xD;
      of HIV, and the number of cases in children is expected to increase over the next several&#xD;
      years. AZT therapy may be effective in altering the course of the disease and decreasing the&#xD;
      high mortality in these children. It is also possible that early intervention with AZT may&#xD;
      prevent the establishment of HIV contracted before, during, or just after birth.&#xD;

      Of a total of 908 pediatric AIDS cases, 78 percent have acquired HIV infection from a mother&#xD;
      with HIV infection or at high risk for acquisition of HIV, and the number of cases in&#xD;
      children is expected to increase over the next several years. AZT therapy may be effective in&#xD;
      altering the course of the disease and decreasing the high mortality in these children. It is&#xD;
      also possible that early intervention with AZT may prevent the establishment of HIV&#xD;
      contracted before, during, or just after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children entered in this study receive oral and IV AZT. The first 6 children receive 2 IV&#xD;
      doses and 2 oral doses over a 2-week period, then 4 weeks of continuous oral dosing (4 doses&#xD;
      per day). The remaining 12 children receive&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 IV dose and 1 oral dose followed by 6 weeks of oral AZT (4 doses per day) and a second IV&#xD;
      dose at the end of the study. Each child is under the care of a specialist in pediatrics and&#xD;
      has a physical examination and laboratory tests before starting AZT and 6 times while taking&#xD;
      AZT to make sure the drug is not having a toxic effect on the child. A single cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) sample is taken from the last 12 children entering the study, so that the level&#xD;
      of the AZT reaching the brain can be measured. The child returns to the hospital or clinic 4&#xD;
      weeks after the end of therapy to make sure that there are no delayed toxic effects.&#xD;
