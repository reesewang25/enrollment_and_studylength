      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DX-8951f in treating women who have&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in women with metastatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the breast who have failed prior therapy with an anthracycline and a&#xD;
      taxane. II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this drug in these&#xD;
      patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast&#xD;
        Prior treatment with an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin or epirubicin) and a taxane (e.g.,&#xD;
        paclitaxel or docetaxel) either as adjuvant therapy or for advanced disease Bidimensionally&#xD;
        measurable disease Sentinel lesions must be outside of any prior radiation port No resected&#xD;

&#xD;
        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No concurrent biologic therapy No prophylactic&#xD;
        colony stimulating factors to prevent neutropenia (except when neutropenia fever occurs&#xD;

        since prior hormonal therapy except for: Patients who are highly unlikely to have a&#xD;
        withdrawal response to cessation of hormonal therapy (e.g., patients with disease that is&#xD;
        primarily resistant to hormonal therapy, patients without prior partial response, or&#xD;
        stabilization of disease lasting less than 6 months) Patients with new or extensive&#xD;
        visceral metastases Patients with rapidly progressive or symptomatic metastases during&#xD;
        hormonal therapy Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior&#xD;
