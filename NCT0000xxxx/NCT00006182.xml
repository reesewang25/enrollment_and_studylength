      To determine how long blood transfusions are needed for primary stroke prevention. Also, to&#xD;
      determine the duration of risk associated with abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD)&#xD;
      and to determine the specificity of the stroke risk model developed in STOP 1 in patients&#xD;
      with abnormal TCD measurements.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without intervention, 11 percent of children with sickle cell anemia will sustain a stroke&#xD;
      before the age of 20. The STOP 2 follows on the recently completed NHLBI trial, Stroke&#xD;
      Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP 1), which found that patients at high risk for&#xD;
      stroke could be identified using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, and that the&#xD;
      incidence of stroke could be reduced by 90 percent in those children by periodic blood&#xD;
      transfusion for at least 36 months. However, chronic intermittent blood transfusions are&#xD;
      cumbersome, expensive and associated with morbidity from iron overload. Thus, this study to&#xD;
      determine if transfusion can be safely halted after 30 months of treatment is critically&#xD;
      important to the continued clinical care of patients with sickle cell disease at risk for&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter, randomized clinical trial, 100 children will be randomized to continue&#xD;
      to receive periodic transfusion therapy and 50 to discontinue receiving periodic transfusion&#xD;
      therapy. The primary endpoint will be the reversion of the transcranial Doppler velocity&#xD;
      levels to greater than 200 cm/second, indicating return of increased risk for overt stroke.&#xD;
      Recruitment will be in two phases. Phase I will include those patients who began transfusions&#xD;
      before April 1, 1999. These will come mainly from the STOP 1 cohort. Those who begin&#xD;
      transfusions after April 1, 1999 but before April 1, 2001 will be eligible for Phase II of&#xD;
      recruitment. All patients will receive quarterly TCD examinations. Patients who revert to&#xD;
      high risk will be offered return to transfusion. The overall design includes a three month&#xD;
      start-up, the two phases of recruitment (established STOP patients and new patients) for a&#xD;
      total of 36 months, 18 months of observations after recruitment ends and then 3 months of&#xD;
      wrap-up.&#xD;
