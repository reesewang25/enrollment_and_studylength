  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to follow responses to treatment with vaccinia immune globulin&#xD;
      (VIG) for safety and clinical benefit [during HIV vaccine research].&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIG is purified from human blood and used to treat serious infections of the vaccinia&#xD;
      (smallpox vaccine) virus or similar viruses. It is the only treatment available for those&#xD;
      viruses. The only available supply of VIG has developed a discoloration over time and&#xD;
      therefore is considered an investigational new drug by the FDA. This study will allow it to&#xD;
      be used for intramuscular injection in a controlled setting for people who may need it&#xD;
      [during HIV vaccine research].&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VIG (Human) is a component of plasma from persons vaccinated with vaccinia vaccine. It is the&#xD;
      only product available for the treatment of vaccinia and other orthopox infections. The only&#xD;
      lot currently available was released as a licensed product in 1995 but is being treated as an&#xD;
      investigational new drug because of slight discoloration in the solution. This study makes&#xD;
      existing stocks of VIG available as a short-term solution for the lack of a licensed immune&#xD;
      globulin to treat vaccinal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before receiving injections and 3 and 6 months after injections, patients are tested for HIV,&#xD;
      hepatitis B, and hepatitis C with pre- and post-test counseling. Referrals for appropriate&#xD;
      medical care are provided. Participants have multiple injections (depending on body weight)&#xD;
      of VIG at 1 or 2 clinic visits. Following administration of VIG, participants are observed&#xD;
      for 1/2 hour at the clinic. Participants return to the clinic for as many as 10 visits to&#xD;
      monitor for any adverse reactions and signs and symptoms of vaccinia infections. On Days 7,&#xD;
      84, and 168 participants return to the clinic for evaluations and have blood drawn to check&#xD;
      for the response to the VIG injections.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sign a consent form including consent for pre/post HIV counseling. If under 18 years&#xD;
             or unable to sign a consent form, the next of kin or a legal guardian must sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experience complications from prior administration of vaccinia virus vaccinations or&#xD;
             accidental exposure to vaccinia or similar viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have eye complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caution should be noted if participants are allergic to thimerosal (a preservative in&#xD;
             the study drug). Precautions can be taken if participants experience a reaction during&#xD;
             VIG administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant will be counseled about risks.&#xD;
