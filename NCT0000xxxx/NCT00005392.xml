      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous disease is commonplace, more prevalent in women, increases with age, and is a major&#xD;
      cause of morbidity. Between 6 and 30 percent of all medical expenditures for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease are for venous disease. Despite these facts, the basic epidemiology of venous disease&#xD;
      has received limited attention. Even the definition of peripheral venous disease varies&#xD;
      widely, often confusing symptoms and signs with demonstrable pathophysiologic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study provided estimates of the extent of peripheral venous disease, contributed to more&#xD;
      efficient diagnosis, allowed insight on how to prevent or ameliorate this condition through&#xD;
      risk factor modification, and provided quantitative estimates of the daily burden this&#xD;
      disease imposes on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall, and age, sex, and ethnic-specific, prevalence of peripheral venous disease was&#xD;
      determined in a stratified multiethnic random sample of 2,408 men and women aged 29 to 91&#xD;
      years. Three specific categories of venous disease were defined including: telangiectasias&#xD;
      and flat reticular veins; superficial venous disease without deep valvular incompetence or&#xD;
      obstruction; deep venous disease, with valvular incompetence or obstruction. Varicose veins&#xD;
      were typically but not invariably present in the latter two categories. These three&#xD;
      categories were diagnosed by an ordered non-invasive evaluation, including visual inspection,&#xD;
      with photographic documentation of abnormal findings, and duplex color sonography to diagnose&#xD;
      valvular incompetence and venous obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation was made of the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of each of the&#xD;
      traditional signs and symptoms of venous disease for each of the three categories of venous&#xD;
      disease. Signs and symptoms evaluated included aching, itching, swelling and edema,&#xD;
      heaviness, cramps, nocturnal restless legs, pigmentation, induration, ulcers, and the&#xD;
      Trendelenburg test. Risk factors were evaluated for each of the above three categories-of&#xD;
      venous disease. Risk factors assessed included age; sex; ethnicity; socioeconomic status;&#xD;
      height; weight; obesity; exercise; blood pressure; standing versus sitting in daily&#xD;
      activities; family history of venous disease; cigarette smoking; alcohol consumption; diet;&#xD;
      constipation; constrictive clothing; aspirin use; use of selected other medications; history&#xD;
      of hernia, flat feet, or other conditions associated with connective tissue laxity; parity;&#xD;
      use of estrogens or progestins; age at menarche; age at menopause; and concomitant arterial&#xD;
      disease. Finally, an evaluation was made of the degree of morbidity and interference with&#xD;
      daily activities resulting from venous disease, using the Quality of Well Being (QWB) scale&#xD;
      developed at University of California at San Diego.&#xD;
