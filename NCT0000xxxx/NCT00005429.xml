      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been well recognized for years that the survival rates among African-Americans with&#xD;
      chronic diseases are reduced compared to their white counterparts. Recently attention has&#xD;
      focussed on racial disparities in survival with chronic cardiovascular diseases. Prior to the&#xD;
      widespread availability of coronary arteriography, African-Americans were thought to have a&#xD;
      very low incidence of coronary artery disease. These findings appear to be inconsistent with&#xD;
      the now generally accepted view that the coronary artery disease mortality rate is nearly&#xD;
      equal in United States Black and white men and is increased in Black women as compared to&#xD;
      white women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Howard University and Howard University Hospital provided a unique environment for studying&#xD;
      the clinical cardiovascular outcomes of African-Americans, in light of its history. That is,&#xD;
      due to the influx of blacks into the District of Columbia in 1862, Freedmen's Hospital (which&#xD;
      is now known as Howard University Hospital) was established for their care. Howard University&#xD;
      Hospital has had an admissions profile with greater than 95 percent African-Americans for the&#xD;
      past century&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used previously collected data to: 1) examine the trends in mortality rates at&#xD;
      Howard University Hospital, based on discharge status, between 1986 - 1992, for selected&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases; 2) compare cardiovascular mortality rate trends between Howard&#xD;
      University Hospital and the National Hospital Discharge data; 3) examine cardiovascular co-&#xD;
      morbidity experiences using a severity of illness index at Howard University Hospital&#xD;
      compared to National data by race/ethnicity, geographic location and hospital bed size; and&#xD;
      4) identify a cohort of cardiovascular patients retrospectively based on repeated discharge&#xD;
      data at Howard University Hospital, to analyze survival data.&#xD;
