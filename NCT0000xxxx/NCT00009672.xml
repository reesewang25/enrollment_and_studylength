      This study will test the effectiveness of two drugs-nortriptyline and MS Contin (a type of&#xD;
      morphine)-to treat pain caused by lumbar radiculopathy, or sciatica. Sciatica results from&#xD;
      damage to the lumbar nerve roots, typically causing back pain and sharp, shooting pain down&#xD;
      one or both legs. Although sciatica is common, there are no good treatments for it. Tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, and opioids, such as morphine, have been effective in&#xD;
      treating other kinds of pain from nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 65 years of age who have had sciatica pain daily for at least 3&#xD;
      months may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide a medical history and occupational and other social information.&#xD;
      They will undergo a neurological examination, routine blood tests and an electrocardiogram&#xD;
      and will fill out three questionnaires providing information on daily functioning and&#xD;
      psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This &quot;cross-over&quot; study consists of several parts, including a baseline study and four&#xD;
      different treatment regimens. During each part, patients keep a daily log in which they rate&#xD;
      their pain, record other procedures they undergo, such as injections and manipulations, and&#xD;
      record medication side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first week of the study, patients remain on their current medications. Any&#xD;
      antidepressants or opioids are stopped gradually before starting the drug trials. After the&#xD;
      first week, patients go through the following four drug trials in random order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nortriptyline and inert placebo-Patients take nortriptyline in doses ranging from 25 mg.&#xD;
           to 100 mg. and an inert placebo for morphine. (An inert placebo is a dummy pill; it&#xD;
           looks like the test drug but has no active ingredient.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MS Contin (morphine) and inert placebo-Patients take MS Contin in doses ranging from 30&#xD;
           mg. to 90 mg. and an inert placebo for nortriptyline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nortriptyline and MS Contin-Patients take MS Contin and nortriptyline in the same dose&#xD;
           ranges as for each drug alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Active placebo and inactive placebo-Patients take an active placebo-in this case&#xD;
           benztropine-and an inert placebo. An active placebo is a drug that does not work for the&#xD;
           problem being studied but whose side effects are like those of the test drug-in this&#xD;
           case, slight sleepiness or dry mouth. Benztropine is given at one-third the recommended&#xD;
           dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each drug regimen, the medication dose is increased gradually over 5 weeks until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose is reached. At the end of each regimen, patients are taken off the&#xD;
      study drugs over a 12-day tapering period and are off drugs completely for another 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are seen by a doctor or nurse at the 7-week point in each study period. After all&#xD;
      the drug trials are finished, patients repeat the questionnaires they filled out at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study. Patients and their doctors will be informed of the medications that&#xD;
      were effective in each individual's care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Irritation or damage to lumbar nerve roots referred to as lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica is&#xD;
      a very common clinical entity with a lifetime prevalence of 1-3% in the adult population.&#xD;
      Lumbar radiculopathy typically causes back pain and sharp, shooting pain in the leg(s).&#xD;
      Despite its prevalence and disabling characteristics, sciatica has never been selectively&#xD;
      studied in drug trials. It is plausible to assume that tricyclic antidepressants and opioids,&#xD;
      which are effective in the treatment of other neuropathic pain syndromes will be beneficial&#xD;
      for chronic lumbar radicular pain as well. This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, four period cross-over study of chronic lumbar radicular pain. Patient&#xD;
      selection will target men and women of all ethnic backgrounds between the ages of 18 and 65&#xD;
      who have had signs and symptoms of sciatica for 3 months or more. Treatments are: 1.&#xD;
      nortriptyline (25-100 mg); 2. morphine (MS Contin 30-90 mg); 3. nortriptyline (25-100 mg)&#xD;
      plus morphine, (MS Contin 30-90 mg); 4. combination of an active placebo, benztropine (0.25-1&#xD;
      mg) and an inert placebo. Patients will be called twice a week to individually titrate doses&#xD;
      and monitor side effects. The primary outcome measures in this study will be the daily pain&#xD;
      scores in the low back, in the leg and combined. Patients' quality of life and activities of&#xD;
      daily living will be secondary outcome measures as assessed by the SF 36 and Oswestry and the&#xD;
      Beck questionnaires. Fifty one patients will be enrolled in this study and the duration of&#xD;
      the study will be 37 weeks.&#xD;
