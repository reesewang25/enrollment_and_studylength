      This project is designed to study whether anti-inflammatory drugs, such as celecoxib, may&#xD;
      delay age-related mental decline. We are also looking at genetic risk and brain structure as&#xD;
      potential predictors of mental decline. We believe people with age-associated memory&#xD;
      impairment who take celecoxib will show less evidence of mental decline than those receiving&#xD;
      placebo (an inactive pill) after 18 months. We expect that brain structure at the start of&#xD;
      the study, memory performance as indicated by tests, and age will be additional predictors of&#xD;
      mental decline. We also predict that cognitive decline (i.e., decline in thinking and memory)&#xD;
      and treatment response will vary according to genetic factors that may correlate with the age&#xD;
      at which dementia begins. We believe other variables such as prior educational achievement,&#xD;
      memory capability at the outset of the study, and gender may influence mental decline and&#xD;
      treatment response. We will study people with age-associated memory impairment (mild memory&#xD;
      complaints, decreased performance in selected memory tests), between 40 and 90 years of age.&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomly (i.e., by a process similar to flipping a coin) assigned to&#xD;
      treatment groups. The subjects will receive either an inactive substance (placebo) or&#xD;
      celecoxib (400 mg/day). The subjects will receive a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan,&#xD;
      FDG PET scan, routine laboratory blood tests, electrocardiogram and cognitive tests. They&#xD;
      will be followed for approximately 18 months and asked to return at specific intervals for&#xD;
      follow-up testing. Measures of brain structure will be derived from baseline MRI scans and&#xD;
      metabolic activity from PET scans, and blood will be drawn and tested to determine which&#xD;
      forms (genotypes) of certain genetically determined cellular components the patient has.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several observational epidemiological studies indicate that anti-inflammatory treatments&#xD;
      attenuate or prevent the symptoms of one of the most common mental disorders of late life,&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuropathological studies also support inflammatory or immune&#xD;
      mechanisms in AD, including findings of reactive microglia within or near AD lesions. Such&#xD;
      evidence, however, is circumstantial, and controlled, randomized drug trials are needed to&#xD;
      determine efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is designed to determine if the commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drug (NSAID), celecoxib, is efficacious in delaying progression of cognitive symptoms in&#xD;
      people with age-related cognitive losses who are at risk for developing AD. A total of 135&#xD;
      subjects with age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) who are at risk for further cognitive&#xD;
      decline (age 40 to 90 years) will be randomized (double-blind design) to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups: celecoxib (400 mg/d) or placebo, and followed for 18 months. All randomized subjects&#xD;
      will receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, FDG PET scans, and selective genotyping&#xD;
      (apolipoprotein E [APOE] and genetic risk for AD onset (e.g., APOE-4). Subjects receiving&#xD;
      celecoxib are expected to show less evidence of cognitive decline than those receiving&#xD;
      placebo. The proposed project builds upon our group's prior work on early detection of AD&#xD;
      using brain imaging, genetic risk, and neuropsychological assessments. This project also is a&#xD;
      logical follow-up to recent observational studies of a promising early intervention and will&#xD;
      represent one of the first controlled, anti-inflammatory treatment trials for persons at high&#xD;
      risk for age-related cognitive decline and the eventual development of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed closely to ensure that medication is safely used, without side&#xD;
      effects (e.g., gastrointestinal, renal, etc.).&#xD;
