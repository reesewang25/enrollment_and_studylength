  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) has developed experimental therapies&#xD;
      that involve taking white blood cells from patients' tumor or from their blood, growing them&#xD;
      in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow patients to under screening and evaluation for participation in NC-SB&#xD;
      Protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years or older must meet the minimum eligibility criteria for an NCI-SB treatment&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo testing and evaluations as required by the appropriate NCI-SB treatment&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential research candidates undergo thorough screening including laboratory tests, scans,&#xD;
      x-rays, and review of pathology slides to determine initial eligibility for National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permit evaluation of patients referred to the NCI-SB in order to identify individuals who&#xD;
      will be suitable candidates for NCI-SB clinical research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess frequency of HLA type, gene specific mutations or expression of neo antigens in&#xD;
      malignant tumors across the population of cancer patients undergoing screening for NCI-SB&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect results of screening tests for use on subsequent research protocol as baseline (e.g.,&#xD;
      pretreatment) values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient suspected of having, or with biopsy proven, malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient is able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient is being evaluated for treatment on an NCI-SB protocols..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled on this protocol will be evaluated by NCI-SB physicians to determine the&#xD;
      individual's suitability for participation in a clinical research protocol. An accrual&#xD;
      ceiling of 7,000 patients has been set to meet the screening needs of the NCI-SB.&#xD;
