    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a new bone injection technique for treating&#xD;
      bone disease in patients with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia or McCune-Albright syndrome. In&#xD;
      these patients, some bones develop areas with much less mineral, making the bones more prone&#xD;
      to fracture or deformity and causing pain. This new treatment is intended to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of fracture, minimize deformities and improve overall function in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 4 years of age and older with bone lesions that are highly likely to cause&#xD;
      significant pain and illness may be eligible for this 2-year study. Participants must be&#xD;
      simultaneously enrolled in NIDCR's research protocol 98-D-0145 (Screening and Natural History&#xD;
      of Patients with Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia and McCune-Albright Syndrome) or 98-D-0146 (A&#xD;
      Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Alendronate in the Treatment of Polyostotic Fibrous&#xD;
      Dysplasia and McCune-Albright Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days of the bone injection procedure, patients will have a medical history, routine&#xD;
      blood tests, urinalysis and check of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and temperature) and&#xD;
      will complete a 30-minute quality-of-life questionnaire. Women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
      will have a pregnancy test. Patients who do not have recent X-rays and bone density scans&#xD;
      available for review will have new ones taken. When these studies are completed, patients&#xD;
      will undergo the bone injection procedure, followed immediately by bone densitometry and&#xD;
      coned-down X-rays, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone injection - Patients will be given an anesthetic either to make them sleepy or put&#xD;
           them to sleep completely. A portion of bone marrow will be withdrawn through a needle&#xD;
           inserted into the hip bone and, at the same time, abnormal bone in the arms and legs&#xD;
           will be sucked out using a needle. The abnormal bone will be replaced with a mixture of&#xD;
           bone marrow and collagen (connective tissue protein) injected into the hole in the bone.&#xD;
           The areas of injection will be closed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone densitometry - X-rays of the operated bone and opposite normal bone will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coned-down X-rays - Magnified normal X-rays will be taken as close-ups of an active&#xD;
           lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a history and physical examination by their local physician or at NIH&#xD;
      every month for the first 4 months after the procedure. Every 6 months after the procedure,&#xD;
      patients will return to NIH for follow-up, including a physical examination and completion of&#xD;
      a quality-of-life questionnaire. Imaging studies of the injected site will be done 3, 6, and&#xD;
      12 months after the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD) is a sporadic disorder which affects multiple sites in&#xD;
      the skeleton. The bone at these sites is rapidly resorbed and replaced by abnormal fibrous&#xD;
      tissue. PFD may occur alone or as part of the McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS), a syndrome&#xD;
      originally defined by the triad of PFD, cafe au lait pigmentation of the skin, and precocious&#xD;
      puberty. The bony lesions are frequently disfiguring and painful. In addition, depending on&#xD;
      the location of the lesion, they can cause significant morbidity. Lesions in weight-bearing&#xD;
      bones can lead to disabling fractures, while lesions in the skull can lead to compression of&#xD;
      vital structures such as the cranial nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no clearly-defined systemic or local therapies for the bone disease, and&#xD;
      results of the use of conventional surgical treatment of sites of impending fracture have&#xD;
      been universally disappointing. In this study, we will treat osteolytic lesions in the long&#xD;
      bones of the upper and lower extremities, the sites of potential fracture, with a novel&#xD;
      surgical approach. This will involve 1) the removal of abnormal tissue through percutaneous&#xD;
      aspiration, and 2) the use of skeletal precursor cells taken from the unaffected sites, mixed&#xD;
      with a bone grafting substitute, and injected into the affected sites to bring about an&#xD;
      improvement in local bone quality and overall patient function.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be otherwise healthy women, men, and children, with polyostotic fibrous&#xD;
        dysplasia (PFD)/McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will be greater than 4 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis will be based on evidence of the clinical spectrum of the disease and&#xD;
        confirmed by the presence of typical findings on bone biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must be actively enrolled in the Screening and Natural History Protocol and&#xD;
        possibly the Bisphosphonate Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be enrolled in the study if they have a lytic lesion of the humerus, femur,&#xD;
        or tibia which satisfies at least one of the following criteria: the lesion encompasses at&#xD;
        least 50% of the width of the bone at that point on both AP and lateral radiographs; the&#xD;
        lesion has caused a change in the anatomical shape and contour of the bone; the lesion has&#xD;
        a bone density less than 50% of the density of the contralateral, normal side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients on previous or concomitant therapy are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients on the Bisphosphonate Protocol must have received at least one month of treatment&#xD;
        on that protocol before receiving a bone marrow injection in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women in childbearing age will be offered barrier methods of contraception to decrease the&#xD;
        risk of pregnancy for a period of one year following the transplant. Subjects who become&#xD;
        pregnant during year one of the study will be transferred to the inactive participant&#xD;
        group. Pregnancy testing will be performed prior to research procedures and surgery.&#xD;
        Subjects using oral contraceptive agents are included. Women without normal menstrual&#xD;
        cycles will be offered hormone replacement therapy for a period of 3 cycles prior to&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must agree to travel to NIH during the first 24 months and remain in the Bethesda&#xD;
        area for the post-operative period as defined by protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they receive phenobarbital or related antiepileptic agents,&#xD;
        including Dilantin or Tegretol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical problems which will preclude participation in the study include: pregnancy; chronic&#xD;
        or active dermatological disease; chronic anemia (thalassemia, etc.); diabetes mellitus&#xD;
        (fasting blood glucose in excess of 140 mg/dl); active or chronic pulmonary disease&#xD;
        including COPD, chronic bronchitis, or asthma requiring medications; active or chronic&#xD;
        gastrointestinal disease including gastric and duodenal ulcer disease and inflammatory&#xD;
        bowel disease; history of cancer except for dermal lesions; intestinal malabsorption,&#xD;
        chronic or active renal disease including a serum creatinine above 1.8 mg/dl; chronic or&#xD;
        active hepatic disease including hepatitis; HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects may not smoke more than one pack of cigarettes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alcohol consumption must be less than 1.5 oz per day, without binge drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects should have no dietary aberrations and no history of anorexia nervosa within the&#xD;
        past 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be willing to receive transfusions of blood products if it is deemed&#xD;
        medically necessary to preserve their well-being or their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded if they have a history of an allergy to all of the following&#xD;
        antibiotics: penicillin, tetracycline, and cephalosporins.&#xD;
