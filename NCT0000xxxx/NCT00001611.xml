  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether medication for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis-a viral&#xD;
      infection of the eye-can safely be stopped in HIV-infected patients whose immune function has&#xD;
      improved from anti-HIV therapy. Medicines taken to fight CMV infection (ganciclovir,&#xD;
      foscarnet, and cidofovir) can cause serious side effects, such as low blood counts and kidney&#xD;
      damage. Stopping these medications may, therefore, be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HIV infection who develop CVM retinitis usually have very low levels of&#xD;
      infection-fighting white blood cells called CD4 cells-less than 50 cells per microliter of&#xD;
      blood. New anti-HIV medications have been able to raise CD4 levels and improve immune&#xD;
      function in many patients. This study will see if patients with CD4 levels above 150 cells&#xD;
      per microliter can fight CVM retinitis without additional anti-CVM drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with CVM retinitis will have a physical examination and complete eye&#xD;
      examination. These tests will be repeated after 2 weeks. If there is no evidence that the CMV&#xD;
      infection has progressed, and if it is in a location that is not immediately&#xD;
      sight-threatening, anti-CMV medications will be stopped. Patients will be examined every 2&#xD;
      weeks for 3 months and then every 3 weeks for the next 3 months. Patients whose CD4 count has&#xD;
      remained above 100 after 6 months will continue to be followed every 4 weeks until the CVM&#xD;
      infection becomes active again. At that time, anti-CVM medicines will be re-started. Patients&#xD;
      will also have blood and urine samples taken to test for levels of HIV and CMV in the blood&#xD;
      and urine, and will be interviewed about their vision and how it affects daily activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to determine whether elevated CD4 counts resulting from medications&#xD;
      against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are effective in controlling cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
      retinitis. Patients with non-progressive retinal disease consistent with inactive CMV&#xD;
      retinitis in a location that is not immediately sight threatening, who are currently&#xD;
      receiving systemic maintenance therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir, and who&#xD;
      have a total CD4 cell count greater than 150 cells per microliter will have their anti-CMV&#xD;
      therapy discontinued. Patients will then be closely followed for progression of their CMV&#xD;
      retinitis. The primary endpoint of the study will be progression of CMV retinitis. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include the occurrence of extraocular CMV disease, morbidity, mortality,&#xD;
      virologic data, and HIV burden.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of AIDS as defined by the Centers for Disease Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inactive, non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis. Non sight-threatening CMV retinitis is&#xD;
        defined as CMV retinitis not within 1000 microns from the optic disc or 1000 microns from&#xD;
        the fovea. Exception: patients with CMV retinitis within 1000 microns of the fovea or disc&#xD;
        in only one eye, if visual acuity in that eye is worse than 20/400 without the use of&#xD;
        eccentric fixation, and visual acuity in the other eye is 20/400 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CD4 T cell count greater than 150 cells per microliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able understand the nature of the study, agree to the provision, and&#xD;
        understand and sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women and men age 18 or older are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelets greater than 25,000/microliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hemoglobin greater than 8.5 gms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Total neutrophil count greater than 750/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Receiving systemic anti-CMV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Receiving anti-HIV therapy. If the patient is receiving IL-2, at least one month from last&#xD;
        infusion must elapse prior to assessment for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intraocular sustained release ganciclovir implant in the eye for less than 9 months, or&#xD;
        other organ involvement from CMV infection requiring use of systemic ganciclovir or&#xD;
        foscarnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CMV retinitis should not involve the retina solely anterior to the equator, or within 1000&#xD;
        microns from the optic disc, or within 1000 microns from the fovea. Exception: patients&#xD;
        with lesions that have involved the fovea or disc and caused visual acuity worse than&#xD;
        20/400 without the use of eccentric fixation, may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Opacification of the cornea, lens, or vitreous in either eye that precludes examination of&#xD;
        the fundus.&#xD;

        toxoplasmosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant psychiatric or emotional disorders that would impair patient understanding or&#xD;
        participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy less than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active CMV disease requiring systemic anti-CMV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CMV retinitis first diagnosised with CD4 T-cell count greater than 150 cells per&#xD;
        microliter.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Participation in conflicting clinical trial.&#xD;
