      To continue studies on the two major neurological complications of sickle cell disease (SCD):&#xD;
      namely, stroke and chronic encephalopathy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke represents a focal brain insult whereas chronic encephalopathy represents a diffuse&#xD;
      brain disturbance involving cognition and memory. The predisposition to stroke and the&#xD;
      potential for dementia were increasingly apparent from our studies and the work of other&#xD;
      investigators in sickle cell disease. The ontogeny of these two processes required further&#xD;
      study before the mechanisms could be clearly articulated; and a coordinated assessment of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular perfusion was needed to decipher the relationship between focal perfusion&#xD;
      deficits and occlusion of large and small cerebral vessels. 150 subjects were enrolled in&#xD;
      these studies. Improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying these two devastating&#xD;
      neurological complications of SCD should result in prevention or effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hypotheses were tested: (1) clinically-silent cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      abnormalities represented the minimal expression of the neurovascular diathesis, and were the&#xD;
      harbingers of clinically-overt strokes (study A); (2) sickle cell disease patients who&#xD;
      developed cerebral infarctions had a predisposing risk factor(s) that contributed to this&#xD;
      neurological complication (study B); and (3) sickle cell disease patients developed a chronic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and dementia that was independent of the neurovascular diathesis (study C).&#xD;
      Study A was a prospective evaluation of 50 SCD children aged 6 to 12 years attempting to&#xD;
      identify a subgroup of patients at risk for the development of a clinically-apparent stroke.&#xD;
      These patients were evaluated clinically, and underwent MRI scan, magnetic resonance&#xD;
      angiography (MRA), and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Study B&#xD;
      represented two studies designed to analyze risk factors for stroke. The first study was a&#xD;
      retrospective case-control analysis of 25 young adults who suffered one or more strokes.&#xD;
      These patients were age-matched to an SCD control group which had been clinically free of&#xD;
      strokes and had MRI, MRA, and SPECT studies. The second study represented a prospective&#xD;
      case-control analysis of children who were being followed in study A. Study C represented a&#xD;
      prospective study of 50 SCD children, and 50 age-matched siblings or closest available&#xD;
      relatives. Annual neurological examinations and neuropsychological evaluations were performed&#xD;
      searching for evidence of chronic encephalopathy and dementia. The longitudinal study design&#xD;
      was necessary to dissect out the subtle variables that contributed to the cognitive deficits.&#xD;
      The study was renewed in FY 1998 to continue through FY 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Darryl DeVivo was PI on Subproject which began in FY 1988 as a competing renewal. The&#xD;
      total grant began several years prior to that. Dollars for the subproject were estimated at&#xD;
      10% of the total funds awarded each year.&#xD;

      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
