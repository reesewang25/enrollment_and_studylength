  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment modalities for uveitis associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have&#xD;
      not been beneficial in the juvenile population. A new approach for treating patients with&#xD;
      presumed autoimmune disorders is oral tolerance therapy. Chicken type II collagen (Colloral)&#xD;
      is being developed as an oral tolerance therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
      This open label pilot study will describe the safety of chicken type II collagen added to&#xD;
      current anti-inflammatory medications as treatment for patients with uveitis associated with&#xD;
      juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The primary ophthalmic outcomes of this study will be a change&#xD;
      from baseline in the number of anterior chamber cells and the number and dosage of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications. Secondary outcomes for JRA will include change in physician's&#xD;
      global assessment, parent/patient assessment of overall well-being, functional assessment,&#xD;
      number of joints with active arthritis, number of joints with limited range of motion, and&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Secondary outcomes for uveitis will include change in&#xD;
      visual acuity, vitreous haze, and anterior chamber flare.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Must meet American College of Rheumatology Criteria for JRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have active anterior uveitis defined as the presence of inflammatory cells in the&#xD;
        anterior chamber in at least one eye, or the current use of topical corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be between 2 and 18 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have had previous therapy for uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be able to undergo a slit lamp biomicroscopy for assessment of anterior chamber cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have a media opacity that precludes assessment of anterior chamber inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have received a periocular injection of corticosteroids within 2 months of&#xD;
        baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not be currently receiving DMARD (disease modifying anti-rheumatic) therapy, with the&#xD;
        exception of prednisone at a dose no greater than 1.5-2.0 mg/kg/day, or methotrexate at a&#xD;
        dose no greater than 10 mg/m(2)/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have active eye or joint inflammation requiring immediate addition or increase in&#xD;
        systemic anti-inflammatory medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have involvement in prior clinical trials of type II collagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have exposure within the past year to shark or other collagen preparations found&#xD;
        in health food stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have a history of gastrointestinal disease which could affect the presentation of&#xD;
        type II collagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women must not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients currently using Latanoprost, patients who have used Latanoprost within the last 2&#xD;
        weeks, or patients who are likely to need Latanoprost during the course of the study will&#xD;
        be excluded.&#xD;
