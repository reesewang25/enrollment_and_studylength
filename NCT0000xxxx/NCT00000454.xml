      This study is designed to increase understanding of the processes that affect the treatment&#xD;
      outcome of individuals with both alcohol and nicotine dependence. Treatment outcome&#xD;
      methodology will be combined with a computerized self-monitoring methodology to examine the&#xD;
      extent to which smoking serves as a cue for alcohol craving and/or as a response to alcohol&#xD;
      craving in treated alcoholics. Subjects will be veterans participating in the Substance Abuse&#xD;
      Day Programs at the Newington and West Haven campuses of the VA Connecticut Healthcare&#xD;
      System. Nonveteran women will be recruited from the community and enrolled in the day&#xD;
      program. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following two conditions: (1)&#xD;
      intensive smoking cessation therapy (counseling plus nicotine replacement using nicotine&#xD;
      patches) concurrent with alcohol treatment, or (2) brief smoking cessation advice concurrent&#xD;
      with alcohol treatment.&#xD;
