  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An important mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to develop and carry out&#xD;
      research studies designed to improve understanding of disease processes and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical research continues to become more focused on specific diseases and the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of diseases in specific groups of people and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to permit inpatient evaluation and care of patients with heart disease&#xD;
      who do not qualify to participate in research studies being conducted by the Cardiology&#xD;
      Branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). These patients are valuable&#xD;
      to the Cardiology Branch of the NHLBI because they help to improve training and experience of&#xD;
      its researchers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An important mission of the NIH is to the conduct of research that elucidates biological&#xD;
      mechanisms, pathogenesis and treatment of diseases. Clinical research has evolved into an&#xD;
      increasingly narrow focus on specific diseases and disease presentations in select subgroups&#xD;
      of patients. It is desirable and consistent with Clinical Center policy, for clinical&#xD;
      investigators to maintain exposure to a more broad spectrum of disease and disease&#xD;
      presentations than mandated by the clinical research protocols in order to preserve clinical&#xD;
      skills of physician and nursing staff, ensure adequate training of clinical research fellows,&#xD;
      and stimulate ideas for future clinical research. This protocol permits evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases who do not fulfill eligibility criteria&#xD;
      for participation in existing clinical research protocols, but who are of medical interest&#xD;
      for the purpose of training professional staff.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with signs or symptoms or risk of cardiovascular disease may participate in this&#xD;
        training protocol. The following is a representative list of the types of patient&#xD;
        presentations and potential diagnoses eligible for this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Coronary artery disease with effort or rest angina or inducible myocardial ischemia as&#xD;
        determined by noninvasive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Valvular heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiomyopathies, including restrictive, congestive, and hypertrophic phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Peripheral-artery disease of upper or lower extremities, with intermittent pain with&#xD;
        activity (e.g. claudication) or limb-threatening ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renovascular disease with uncontrolled hypertension, intermittent pulmonary edema, or&#xD;
        evidence of ischemic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Congenital heart disease, with communications between chambers or major vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        Heart surgery patients treated at the Clinical Center prior to closure of the Heart Surgery&#xD;
        Branch in 1990&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy, for those patients who require testing or treatment requiring dobutamine,&#xD;
        gadolinium or contrast media or radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability of patient, parent or legal guardian to provide informed consent.&#xD;
