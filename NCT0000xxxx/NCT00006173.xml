  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is a potentially curable disease affecting 0.5-5 percent of&#xD;
      patients with hypertension. The current diagnostic work-up of RVH involves a complex&#xD;
      algorithm which includes doppler ultrasound, captopril renography and conventional&#xD;
      angiography. Because of the expense, risk and inconvenience of this workup, patients may not&#xD;
      be correctly diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in MR technology present the opportunity to develop a single comprehensive test.&#xD;
      This would combine an MR angiogram that provides anatomic information about the renal&#xD;
      arteries, and an MR renogram that provides information about the functional impact of a&#xD;
      stenosis as a cause of hypertension. Our main purpose is to test MR renography with and&#xD;
      without an oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) combined with MR angiography&#xD;
      against the reference standard of captopril radionuclide renography. Secondary goals of this&#xD;
      study are to test whether hypoxia within ischemic kidneys affected by RVH is detectable by T2&#xD;
      weighted (Blood oxygen level dependent or BOLD) MRI. This is considered of value since such a&#xD;
      test of oxygenation would further shorten and simplify the diagnostic MR test. Information&#xD;
      gained from this study could lead to important changes in the diagnostic and pathophysiologic&#xD;
      understanding of RVH.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers or patients with significant clinical suspicion of renovascular&#xD;
        hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects able to understand the informed consent for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be able to hold their breath for 20 second intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be clinically stable and be judged by their physician able to tolerate the MR&#xD;
        study of 1.5-2 hour duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any contraindication for MR study including: pacemaker or other implanted electronic&#xD;
        device; cochlear implants; metal in the eye; embedded shrapnel fragments; cerebral aneurysm&#xD;
        clips; or medical infusion pumps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allergy to gadolinium, iodinated contrast media, ACEIs, or sulphur-containing medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients have a hematocrit at or below 30. Severe anemia may predispose to hypotension&#xD;
        after captopril.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with hyperkalemia (plasma potassium: above 5.0 mmol/L), because of the risk of&#xD;
        arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinically unstable patients and those unable to tolerate a 1-2 hour MR study. Examples of&#xD;
        medical conditions that would lead to exclusion include unstable angina, dyspnea at rest,&#xD;
        severe pain at rest, or severe back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nursing mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are claustrophobic and are unable to tolerate MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a serum creatinine concentration above 4mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bilateral renal stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects must not have an abnormality detected on dipstick urinalysis, or a&#xD;
        systolic BP above 140 mmHg or a diastolic BP above 90 mmHg on screening examination or an&#xD;
        abnormal BUN or creatinine level in the blood.&#xD;
