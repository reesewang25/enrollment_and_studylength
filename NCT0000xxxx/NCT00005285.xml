      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past four decades, a significant research effort has been devoted to the&#xD;
      understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of chronic obstructive airways disease&#xD;
      (COPD) in adult life. Epidemiologic studies uniformly have identified cigarette smoking as&#xD;
      the predominant risk factor for the occurrence of COPD. Other factors such as socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, environmental pollution, occupational exposures, and inherent genetic susceptibility&#xD;
      have been observed to have very limited roles as risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have suggested that postnatal maternal cigarette smoking has a measurable&#xD;
      effect on lung function in children. One longitudinal analysis of this problem in children&#xD;
      5-19 years of ages identified significant effects on the growth of FEV1 and forced expiratory&#xD;
      flow between the 25th and 75th percent volume points (FEF25-75) of the volume-time curve.&#xD;
      These investigators, however, pointed out that the effects which they observed could have&#xD;
      resulted from the in utero consequences of maternal smoking during pregnancy and/or from&#xD;
      exposure to factors such as severe respiratory illnesses which have been documented to occur&#xD;
      with increased frequency early in infancy and were not measured by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women were identified during the first trimester and followed monthly. Assessments&#xD;
      were made of their smoking habits, urinary cotinine measurements, general medical condition,&#xD;
      and status of pregnancy. Within two weeks of birth the infants were evaluated with partial&#xD;
      forced expiratory flow-volume curves and measurement of passive respiratory system compliance&#xD;
      and resistance. Measurements were repeated at intervals until age five. Babies were also&#xD;
      observed regularly for respiratory illness experience, passive exposure to cigarette smoke,&#xD;
      and general respiratory health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study helped to elucidate: the effect of maternal cigarette smoking on lung function at&#xD;
      birth and development of function at five years; the effects of postnatal factors on lung&#xD;
      development; the extent to which the reported increased frequency of respiratory illness in&#xD;
      infants of smoking mothers resulted from in utero exposure to tobacco smoke products or&#xD;
      postnatal passive smoking.&#xD;
