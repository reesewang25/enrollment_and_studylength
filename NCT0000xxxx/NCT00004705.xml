      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the stability of uridine triphosphate (UTP) and examine the&#xD;
      metabolism of exogenous nucleotides on airway epithelial surfaces in patients with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the acute safety and efficacy of aerosolized UTP in children with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients may be treated on any of three different regimens. Patients may be&#xD;
      treated on more than one regimen, if they meet the eligibility requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on regimen A are adults and receive uridine triphosphate (UTP) by inhalation,&#xD;
      followed immediately by bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on regimen B are children, aged 4 to 10 years. Patients receive up to 4 graded doses&#xD;
      of UTP by inhalation on day 1. On day 2, patients receive a single dose of UTP. Patients&#xD;
      receive amiloride followed by UTP by inhalation on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on regimen C are children, aged 4 to 18 years. Patients inhale a radiolabelled&#xD;
      (technetium 99m) monodisperse iron oxide aerosol. Radiation deposited in the patient's lungs&#xD;
      is monitored. Patients are randomized to receive one of 4 different aerosols (vehicle; UTP;&#xD;
      amiloride; or UTP plus amiloride), which is inhaled for 20 minutes. Patients are followed 24&#xD;
      hours after aerosol exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen D is a dose escalation study in which patients are aged 9 to 40 years. Patients&#xD;
      receive either the vehicle or UTP by inhalation 3 times daily for 3 days. Cohorts of 4&#xD;
      patients each are entered at each dose level.&#xD;
