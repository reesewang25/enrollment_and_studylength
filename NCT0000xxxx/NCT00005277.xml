      To determine the natural history of sickle cell disease from birth to death in order to&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) and related hemoglobinopathies involving sickle hemoglobin (HbS)&#xD;
      had been recognized for many years and numerous clinical and laboratory manifestations had&#xD;
      been described. However, the clinical course of sickle cell disease was poorly documented.&#xD;
      The ability to establish concrete interrelationships among signs, symptoms and laboratory&#xD;
      test results was complicated by the complexity of the interaction of basic disease processes&#xD;
      with other health related events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive evaluations of the clinical status of patients were usually carried out only&#xD;
      during hospitalizations for 'crises' or other acute illnesses. Because of this inconsistent&#xD;
      nature of the doctor/patient relationships, methods of periodic recording of the patient's&#xD;
      status needed to be established. Further, the obtaining of comprehensive laboratory data was&#xD;
      necessary during periods of apparent clinical remissions as well as hospitalizations. A well&#xD;
      designed, statistically valid, longitudinal study could make a significant contribution to a&#xD;
      better understanding of sickle cell disease. Information was particularly lacking on the&#xD;
      clinical course starting at birth. Criteria needed to be formulated that could establish&#xD;
      classifications of organ involvement and severity of the disease processes. Such&#xD;
      classifications could ultimately be used in establishing the need for and evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy of proposed therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The source of the idea for the study dates back to 1971 when the Hematology Study Section&#xD;
      recommended in a position paper a study on the natural history of sickle cell disease. The&#xD;
      Hemolytic Disease Study Group of the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources developed a&#xD;
      detailed protocol in 1973. The National Sickle Cell Disease Advisory Committee endorsed the&#xD;
      idea in 1975. In April 1976, the Red Cell Working Group of the Blood Diseases and Resources&#xD;
      Advisory Committee recommended initiating the study. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Advisory Council approved the initiative in December 1976.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I, the Planning Phase, began in 1977. The protocols and Manual of Operations were&#xD;
      developed in this phase. Phase II, the Enrollment Phase, began in March 1979 and ended in&#xD;
      March 1981, except for infants younger than 6 months of age, who continued to be enrolled&#xD;
      after March 1981. In 1983 the study was extended for an additional five years through 1988.&#xD;
      Beginning in 1989, as a separate initiative, the study follows selected patient groups from&#xD;
      the original study for an additional five years. The selected groups include the newborn&#xD;
      cohort and patients surviving beyond age 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1981, the NHLBI offered a special competition for the evaluation of cardiac function in&#xD;
      sickle cell disease patients who were enrolled in the cooperative study of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. The original general study protocol required assessment of the lungs, spleen,&#xD;
      kidneys, eyes, and liver but not the heart. The cardiac function study objectives were: to&#xD;
      determine cardiac function in a cross-section of sickle cell patients participating in the&#xD;
      larger study; to determine the incidence, prevalence, and onset of cardiac impairment; and to&#xD;
      assess changes in cardiac function and correlate the observed changes with other clinical&#xD;
      data. A total of 300 patients had an entry cardiac evaluation in the third year of the study&#xD;
      (June 1, 1981 through November 30, 1981) and an exit cardiac evaluation two years later in&#xD;
      the fifth year of the study which was conducted at four centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve cooperative study of sickle cell disease centers and eleven other clinical&#xD;
      institutions initiated the Penicillin Prophylaxis in Sickle Cell Disease (PROPS I) clinical&#xD;
      trial in August 1983. The objective of the trial was to determine whether the regular daily&#xD;
      administration of oral penicillin would reduce the incidence of documented infection due to&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae in children aged 3 months to 3 years with sickle cell anemia. The&#xD;
      trial was scheduled to end in February 1986 but was terminated eight months early, after an&#xD;
      average of 15 months of follow-up, when an 84 percent reduction in the incidence of infection&#xD;
      was observed in the penicillin group as compared to the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data were collected, including demographic and past medical history and clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory information. Stabilized patients were re-examined every six months. Newborns and&#xD;
      young infants were re-examined every two to three months. Organ damage to the lungs, spleen,&#xD;
      kidneys, eyes, and liver was measured at specific entry and exit points to provide&#xD;
      longitudinal data. Data was also gathered on all acute and chronic complications related to&#xD;
      sickle cell disease to provide cross-sectional evaluation.&#xD;
