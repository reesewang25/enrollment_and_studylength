  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disease resulting from glucocerebroside accumulation&#xD;
      in macrophages due to a genetic deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It may occur in&#xD;
      patients of all ages. The condition is marked by enlargement of the liver and spleen&#xD;
      (hepatosplenomegaly), low blood and platelet counts, and bone abnormalities. The condition is&#xD;
      passed from generation to generation on via autosomal recessive inheritance. There are&#xD;
      actually three types of Gaucher disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type I is the most common form. It is a chronic non-neuronopathic form, meaning the disease&#xD;
      does not affect the nervous system. The symptoms of type I can appear at any age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 Gaucher disease presents prenatally or in infancy and usually results in death for the&#xD;
      patient. Type 2 is an acute neuronopathic form and can affect the brain stem. It is the most&#xD;
      severe form of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 3 Gaucher disease is also neuronopathic, however it is subacute in nature. This means&#xD;
      the course of the illness lies somewhere between long-term (chronic) and short-term (acute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is not a cure for Gaucher disease. Treatment for the disease has&#xD;
      traditionally been supportive. In some severely affected patients, bone-marrow transplants&#xD;
      have corrected the enzyme deficiency, but it is considered a high-risk procedure and recovery&#xD;
      can be very slow. Enzyme replacement therapy is another therapy option and has been approved&#xD;
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in type 1 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEG-glucocerbrosidase is a drug designed to clear out the accumulation of lipid&#xD;
      (glucocerebroside) from the blood stream. The drug is actually an enzyme attached to large&#xD;
      molecules called polyethylene glycol (PEG). The large molecules of PEG allow the enzyme to&#xD;
      remain in the blood stream for long periods of time. By modifying glucocerebrosidase with&#xD;
      PEG, it is believed that smaller doses will be required, meaning a reduction in cost for the&#xD;
      patient and more convenient administration of the drug. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects and safety of enzyme replacement therapy using PEG- glucocerebrosidase&#xD;
      for the treatment of Gaucher disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the biochemical and therapeutic effects and&#xD;
      safety of enzyme replacement therapy using polyethyleneglycol (PEG) modified&#xD;
      glucocerebrosidase for the treatment of Gaucher disease and to evaluate the benefit to risk&#xD;
      ratio. The study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy in Gaucher patients of&#xD;
      recombinantly produced human glucocerebrosidase, which is PEG modified. Parameters to be&#xD;
      monitored include hemoglobin, platelet counts, organ size, and extent of bony involvement.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and antibody studies will also be evaluated.&#xD;
