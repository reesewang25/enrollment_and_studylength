      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator originally applied for the grant in response to an NHLBI initiative on &quot;CVD&#xD;
      Nutrition Education for Low Literacy Skills&quot;. The initiative originated within the Prevention&#xD;
      and Demonstration Branch of the DECA, was approved by the September 1988 National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Advisory Council, and released in July 1990. However, the grant was not&#xD;
      awarded as part of the RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal was to achieve a significant increase in the proportion of African Americans&#xD;
      consuming a low fat, low salt &quot;prudent&quot; diet and to increase the proportion with optimal&#xD;
      levels of blood pressure and total blood cholesterol. The specific aims were to: 1) assess&#xD;
      the eating patterns and attendant nutrition literacy issues in urban African Americans, 2)&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of a lay volunteer-mediated multimodal culturally-specific&#xD;
      church-based intervention compared with a strategy using solely written and visual self-help&#xD;
      materials, 3) determine the impact of an intensive culturally-specific nutrition education&#xD;
      intervention on the selection of &quot;prudent&quot; low fat, low salt alternatives when compared with&#xD;
      the usual approaches to influencing food selection in major markets and fast-food&#xD;
      restaurants, and 4) develop a process module which allowed generalization of this&#xD;
      community-based technique to other low literacy high cultural-specificity groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had three phases and utilized a social-marketing approach. Phase I, the first year&#xD;
      of the study, was a community diagnosis consisting of a population-based random-digit-dialing&#xD;
      survey and a series of focus groups to define eating patterns and nutrient intake in their&#xD;
      social context in the African American population. Community focus groups were conducted to&#xD;
      design culturally-specific nutrition education modules to be used in two subsequent&#xD;
      randomized trials. Phase I also consisted of the adaptation of existing instruments to&#xD;
      determine nutrition literacy levels, comprehension and the readability specifically in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II, in years two, three and the first six months of year four of the study, was&#xD;
      comprised of a randomized trial of a nutrition education module administered through trained&#xD;
      lay nutrition counselors in East Baltimore churches compared with churches which received&#xD;
      only self-help materials designed for the literacy level. Outcomes included assessment of&#xD;
      total calories from fat, from saturated fat, cholesterol in mg/day and blood pressure and&#xD;
      blood cholesterol levels measured one, six and 12 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III, conducted in year four, consisted of a randomized trial of an intensive nutrition&#xD;
      intervention which was designed for the culture and was compared with usual advertising and&#xD;
      food-selection influence techniques in eight fast food restaurants and four large food&#xD;
      markets in East Baltimore. Outcomes included the shift in sales from high to low fat and salt&#xD;
      alternatives (as determined by computerized sales and inventory data) during the intervention&#xD;
      and two weeks following the intervention. All interventions in Phase II and III evolved from&#xD;
      the focus groups and survey work performed in Phase I.&#xD;
