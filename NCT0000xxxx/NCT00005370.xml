  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a longitudinal study of the relationship between the rate of decline of pulmonary&#xD;
      function and measurements of cortisol concentration and excretion in a sample of middle-aged&#xD;
      and older men and their wives. The study tested the hypothesis that persons whose plasma&#xD;
      cortisol concentrations were relatively low, albeit within the normal range, were predisposed&#xD;
      to excessively rapid deterioration of pulmonary function during aging.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was hoped that the study would provide important insights into the pathogenesis of chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease with potential implications for prevention and early&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects participating in the Normative Aging Study were recruited for the study at the&#xD;
      time of their next scheduled examination. Twenty-four hour urinary excretion of free&#xD;
      cortisol, morning serum cortisol concentration, and pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometric&#xD;
      indices were measured. For the 700 subjects who were recruited during years one and two of&#xD;
      the study, these measurements were repeated when subjects returned for their next triennial&#xD;
      examination in years four and five of the study. Respiratory illness and smoking&#xD;
      questionnaire data, total and differential leukocyte counts, and methacholine inhalation&#xD;
      challenge test data were also available at both time points. The specific aims of the study&#xD;
      were to examine: (1) the cross-sectional relationship between level of pulmonary function and&#xD;
      both morning serum cortisol concentration and 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion; (2)&#xD;
      the relationship between the rate of decline of pulmonary function during the follow-up&#xD;
      interval and these measurements of cortisol concentration and excretion; (3) whether these&#xD;
      relationships were modified by smoking history, blood total leukocyte count, methacholine&#xD;
      airway responsiveness, or other characteristics; and (4) the stability over time of serum&#xD;
      cortisol concentration and urinary cortisol excretion in this aging population.&#xD;
