      RATIONALE: Green tea extract contains ingredients that may slow the growth of certain&#xD;
      cancers, as well as prevent the development of new cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of green tea extract in treating patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of green tea extract administered daily&#xD;
      to adults with solid tumors. II. Determine the safety of chronic daily administration of&#xD;
      green tea extract in these patients. III. Investigate the clinical pharmacology of green tea&#xD;
      extract in this study. IV. Document observed antitumor activity of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of green tea extract. Patients receive green tea&#xD;
      extract by mouth daily after meals for 4 weeks. One patient is entered at each dose level. If&#xD;
      grade II toxicities are experienced, then 2 more patients are entered at the same dose level.&#xD;
      One patient must complete 4 weeks of therapy and 2 others must complete 2 weeks of therapy&#xD;
      with no greater than grade I toxicity before dose escalation proceeds. If at least 2 patients&#xD;
      experience dose limiting toxicity at any dose level, the immediately preceding dose level is&#xD;
      considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). At least 6 patients are studied at the MTD.&#xD;
      Patients may continue therapy for up to 6 months in the absence of toxicity and disease&#xD;
      progression. Patients are followed every 4 weeks for the duration of treatment and at least&#xD;
      one month after completing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
