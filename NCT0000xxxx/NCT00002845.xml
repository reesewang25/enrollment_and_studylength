      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients who&#xD;
      have metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response and survival rates of patients with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
      following induction with high-dose and maintenance with low-dose interleukin-2. II. Assess&#xD;
      the toxicity of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: All patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 over 24 hours, followed by low-dose&#xD;
      interleukin-2 for 4 days in the absence of toxicity. Patients receive a second cycle&#xD;
      beginning 9-13 days after completion of the first cycle, with response assessed approximately&#xD;
      2 months after initiating therapy. Patients with stable or responding disease receive a&#xD;
      second course as above; those with a continued response may receive additional courses&#xD;
      provided toxicity is limited. Patients are followed for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be entered.&#xD;
