      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 50 million Americans suffer from hypertension, a condition associated with&#xD;
      increased risk for stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure. While non-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention has resulted in dramatic reductions in resting systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure for those with elevated pressures, a debate continues over the efficacy of&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention because of deleterious side effects. As a result, there has been&#xD;
      an increased interest in aerobic exercise as a non-pharmacologic approach in treating&#xD;
      hypertension. Recent reviews of literature have synthesized research using the 'traditional'&#xD;
      approach (chronologically arranging and describing the studies, perhaps by sub-topic) which&#xD;
      may result in subjective, non-replicable conclusions. Consequently, the relationships among&#xD;
      such variables as subject characteristics, experimental design quality, training program&#xD;
      characteristics, and how they contribute to changes in resting systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meta-analytic approach is used in the study to synthesize research on the relationships&#xD;
      among variables associated with aerobic exercise intervention and resting systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure in adults. Meta-analysis is a method of pooling the results of&#xD;
      separate studies. It is a quantitative approach for increasing statistical power of primary&#xD;
      end points and subgroups, resolving uncertainty when studies disagree, improving estimates of&#xD;
      effect sizes, and answering questions not posed at the start of individual trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first two years of the study, a meta-analysis was conducted of all studies published&#xD;
      since 1966 on aerobic exercise and blood pressure. The study was renewed in FY 2000 to&#xD;
      conduct meta-analysis of all studies of exercise training in children and youth under age 21&#xD;
      years in which resting BP was measured. This will include both randomized and non-randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials of at least eight weeks duration found in English journals and theses between&#xD;
      1966 and 1999. Standard meta-analysis techniques will be applied.&#xD;
