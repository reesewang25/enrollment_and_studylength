      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine in treating women with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of pyrazoloacridine (PZA) administered by 3-hour infusion&#xD;
      in women with metastatic breast cancer. II. Assess the qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      toxicities of PZA on this schedule. III. Assess the response duration and survival of&#xD;
      patients treated with this agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: All patients receive intravenous pyrazoloacridine (PZA) every 3 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Therapy continues in responding patients&#xD;
      until 6 months after a complete response or for 1 year, whichever is shorter; stable patients&#xD;
      receive a maximum of 4 courses. The dose is increased once for patients who experience&#xD;
      minimal toxicity. Patients who fail PZA are encouraged to continue therapy with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/fluorouracil (CAF). All patients are followed for survival.&#xD;
      Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 20 patients will be accrued over 7-12 months. If no more than 1&#xD;
      response is seen in the first 12 evaluable patients, accrual will cease.&#xD;

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically documented breast adenocarcinoma Clinical or&#xD;
        radiologic evidence of metastatic disease required Histologic confirmation recommended if&#xD;
        evidence is equivocal Bidimensionally measurable disease required, i.e.: Lesion with&#xD;
        clearly defined margins on physical exam or radiologic evaluation with 1 diameter greater&#xD;
