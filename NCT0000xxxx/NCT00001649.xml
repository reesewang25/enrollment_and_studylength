    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the drug valaciclovir in preventing&#xD;
      transmission of genital herpes from an infected to an uninfected sexual partner. Genital&#xD;
      herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), or, infrequently herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      1 (HSV-1). Valaciclovir prevents the herpes virus from multiplying and may also reduce its&#xD;
      transmission between partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples 18 years of age and older in which one partner is infected with HSV-2 (source&#xD;
      partner) and the other is not (susceptible partner), may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with blood tests for routine laboratory studies and to verify the&#xD;
      presence or absence of HSV-2 or HSV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a medical history, undergo a physical examination, including genital&#xD;
      examination, and receive counseling on safer sex practices and how to recognize signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of a possible first episode of genital herpes. Source partners will also be&#xD;
      counseled on transmission of genital herpes, and susceptible partners will be interviewed&#xD;
      about their sexual history and practices. The source partner will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      take either a 500-mg tablet of valaciclovir or placebo (a pill with no active ingredient)&#xD;
      daily for 8 months. All participants will be given diary cards to complete for a month-the&#xD;
      source partner will record any drug side effects and the susceptible partner will record any&#xD;
      signs or symptoms of possible HSV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen in the clinic once a month for 8 months. At these visits, source&#xD;
      partners will 1) return unused study medication and the completed diary card; 2) discuss any&#xD;
      adverse drug side effects experienced in the last month; 3) review medications other than the&#xD;
      study drug taken in the last month; 4) undergo counseling on safer sex practices,&#xD;
      transmission of genital herpes, and recognizing signs and symptoms of a first episode of&#xD;
      genital herpes; and 5) review symptoms and recurrences of genital herpes experienced during&#xD;
      the last month. During the final visit, they will also provide a blood sample for routine&#xD;
      testing and possible use in future studies. Susceptible partners will 1) have a blood sample&#xD;
      drawn for HSV testing; 2) undergo safer sex counseling; 3) review any symptoms experienced&#xD;
      over the last month; 4) be interviewed about sexual exposure and practices; and 5) return the&#xD;
      completed diary card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source partners who have a recurrence of genital HSV while on the study will be asked to have&#xD;
      their lesions cultured and will be offered open-label valaciclovir treatment. Susceptible&#xD;
      partners who contract genital herpes from the source partner during the study will have a&#xD;
      genital examination to verify a fist episode of genital herpes and will receive 10 days of&#xD;
      open-label treatment with valaciclovir. Cultures will be taken from the mouth and genitals,&#xD;
      current medical conditions will be reviewed, blood samples will be drawn on treatment days 1&#xD;
      and 10, and treatment side effects will be reviewed on days 5 and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, infected partners will be offered a 12-month course of valaciclovir,&#xD;
      one 500-mg tablet daily. Participants will be followed in the clinic once every 3 months to&#xD;
      provide blood samples, return unused study medication and the diary card, discuss any drug&#xD;
      side effects, review medications taken besides the study drug, and review symptoms or&#xD;
      recurrences of genital herpes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire for gathering information about&#xD;
      people with genital herpes and people at risk for the infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of valaciclovir in preventing the transmission of herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      (HSV) in heterosexual couples discordant for the presence of herpes simplex type 2 virus&#xD;
      (HSV-2) antibody. The seropositive source partner will be randomized to receive valaciclovir&#xD;
      500 mg once daily or placebo for 8 months, and the susceptible seronegative partner will be&#xD;
      monitored for clinical and subclinical (serological) acquisition of HSV. Couples must be 18&#xD;
      years of age or older, in general good health, and in a monogamous relationship with each&#xD;
      other. Source partners must be seropositive for HSV-2, have a history of genital herpes&#xD;
      recurrences, and experiencing less than 10 recurrences per year, and be off suppressive&#xD;
      therapy upon entry into the study. Susceptible partners must be HSV-2 seronegative. The&#xD;
      couple will be stratified based on gender and HSV status of the susceptible partner in a&#xD;
      2:2:1:1 ratio [HSV-1 negative female: HSV-1 positive female: HSV-1 negative male: HSV-1&#xD;
      positive male]. They will then be randomized to either valaciclovir 500 mg once daily or&#xD;
      placebo (1:1 randomization) within each stratum. The primary endpoint is the proportion of&#xD;
      couples with clinical evidence of a first episode of genital HSV in the susceptible partner&#xD;
      with laboratory confirmation. Secondary endpoints will be time to clinical symptoms of&#xD;
      genital HSV by the susceptible partner, time to seroconversion in the susceptible partner,&#xD;
      and time to first recurrence of HSV in the source partner. A total of 1500 couples will be&#xD;
      randomized into the study. Assuming a 3% incidence in the placebo arm and a reduction of 75%&#xD;
      in the risk of showing clinical evidence of genital HSV, this study will have at least 80%&#xD;
      power for a two-tailed test at the 5% level of significance. The safety and tolerance of&#xD;
      valaciclovir will be assessed by laboratory evaluation and by occurrence and nature of&#xD;
      adverse events. The study will be conducted at approximately 35 outpatient centers in the&#xD;
      United States, Canada and Europe, therefore it is expected that each center will enroll&#xD;
      between 40 to 60 couples.&#xD;
