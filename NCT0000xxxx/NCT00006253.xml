      Patients with advanced cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy and who report pain and fatigue&#xD;
      at intake in the past 24 hours or at a level 2 or higher of pain or fatigue at a 3 or higher&#xD;
      on a 10-point scale will be assigned randomly to an 8-week, 6-contact self management&#xD;
      attention control (SMAC) intervention, or to a 8-week, 6-contact experimental patient&#xD;
      intervention for management of symptoms and support (PIMSS) targeted toward symptom&#xD;
      management, reducing impact on physical role and social functioning and emotional distress.&#xD;
      Both groups will continue to receive conventional cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When compared with the self-management attention control intervention, patients exposed to&#xD;
      the experimental intervention will report statistically significant positive effects on the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary outcome--total number of symptoms reported;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary patient outcomes--reduced deterioration in physical role impact and social&#xD;
           functioning, emotional distress, levels of communication with caregiver about care, and&#xD;
           communication and satisfaction with provider care; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Caregiver outcomes--greater involvement in symptom management, increased mastery of the&#xD;
           caregiving process, reduced levels of depression and burden.&#xD;

      GOAL: The primary goal of this research is to test a symptom management intervention,&#xD;
      delivered by nurses with special training, using a stepped-care approach targeted toward pain&#xD;
      and fatigue, followed by fifteen other prevalent cancer symptoms. Second goals are to improve&#xD;
      physical and social functioning, lower emotional distress, and improve communication with&#xD;
      family caregiver in symptom management, and assist them to reduce their levels of depression&#xD;
      and burden. This research is funded through a grant from the National Cancer Institutes, and&#xD;
      builds upon the Family Care Research Team's program of supportive cancer-care research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: This study tests a stepped-approach intervention to determine if it improves&#xD;
      symptom outcomes, especially pain and fatigue. Secondary outcomes addressed by the&#xD;
      intervention are physical role impact, social functioning, and emotional distress. These&#xD;
      outcomes can have significant impact on patients and family caregivers' well-being as&#xD;
      patients undergo chemotherapy. The shorter, more intense intervention corresponds to changes&#xD;
      int he clinical management of cancer patient with more intense, shorter chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatments; therefore, this intervention will be more easily translatable to the clinical&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
