  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of giving indinavir and rifabutin at the&#xD;
      same time (simultaneously) vs 4 hours apart (staggered) to HIV-positive and HIV-negative&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to determine which medications for HIV-associated diseases, such as&#xD;
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, can be given safely and effectively with anti-HIV&#xD;
      drugs. Indinavir and rifabutin have been given simultaneously in the past with good results.&#xD;
      This study seeks to examine if staggering the doses will make the 2 drugs more effective.&#xD;
      HIV-negative volunteers are used in this study to examine the effect of rifabutin on&#xD;
      indinavir and the effect of staggered rifabutin doses. The effect of rifabutin on the drug&#xD;
      activity of indinavir is evaluated in HIV-positive patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, rifabutin is the only rifamycin that can be administered with indinavir. ACTG 365&#xD;
      is the first formal study of the pharmacokinetics of this dosing combination regimen in HIV&#xD;
      seropositive patients. It is hypothesized that staggered administration of rifabutin and&#xD;
      indinavir might minimize their pharmacokinetic interaction. If the intestinal tract plays a&#xD;
      significant role in the presystemic clearance of rifabutin, the inhibitory activity of&#xD;
      indinavir on rifabutin could depend on either luminal concentrations of indinavir, systematic&#xD;
      concentrations of indinavir, or both. If luminal concentrations are important, then the&#xD;
      interaction between these 2 drugs will be maximal when administered simultaneously, and&#xD;
      minimal when their oral administration is staggered. Finally, since indinavir has a half-life&#xD;
      of 1.8 hours, its effects on rifabutin's systematic clearance may be much less when&#xD;
      administration of these drugs is staggered by 4 hours as compared with simultaneous&#xD;
      administration with rifabutin. If the interaction on rifabutin is minimized, then the&#xD;
      rifabutin levels may be suboptimal for treatment of tuberculosis in patients who are not&#xD;
      administered the 2 drugs simultaneously. It is, therefore, important to define the magnitude&#xD;
      of the effect of staggered vs simultaneous drug administration in order to clarify dose and&#xD;
      regimen recommendations in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis who also require protease&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm A is a multiple-dose, 3-period, sequential study in 18 evaluable HIV-infected&#xD;
      indinavir-naive male and female volunteers [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/16/98: Arm A will be assessed&#xD;
      in 18 evaluable HIV-seronegative patients]. Patients receive 3 different treatments&#xD;
      consisting of 14 days of administration: rifabutin alone (Period IA); indinavir plus&#xD;
      rifabutin (Period IIA); and indinavir plus rifabutin (Period IIIA). Study Arm B is a&#xD;
      multiple-dose, 2-period, sequential study in 10 evaluable HIV-infected male and female&#xD;
      volunteers. Patients receive 2 different treatments, each consisting of 14 days of&#xD;
      administration; indinavir alone (Period IB); and indinavir plus rifabutin (Period IIB).&#xD;
      Patients on both arms take each dose of their study medications with water. [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      8/8/97: Patients treated on Arm A are randomized, following Period IA therapy, to Period IIA&#xD;
      or IIIA therapy for 14 days, then are crossed over to the alternate regimen for 14 days.] [AS&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 4/17/98: After completion of therapy on Arm A or B, patients continue therapy&#xD;
      with indinavir alone for 7 days.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/16/98: The final 7 days of indinavir&#xD;
      dosing has been eliminated for patients on Arm A. Also per this amendment, to ensure&#xD;
      compliance, Arm A patients' rifabutin supply will be dispensed in containers fitted with an&#xD;
      electronic monitoring cap device.]&#xD;
