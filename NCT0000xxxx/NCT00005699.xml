      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was in response to a demonstration and education initiative, &quot;Improving&#xD;
      Hypertensive Care for Inner City Minorities&quot;, which was reviewed and approved by the Clinical&#xD;
      Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee in April 1992 and by the National Heart, Lung,&#xD;
      and Blood Advisory Council in May 1992. The Request for Applications was released in October&#xD;
      1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program consisted of a community wide education program, an intensive intervention&#xD;
      directed toward individuals with hypertension, and an intervention for health care providers.&#xD;
      The program was developed by a coalition of community organizations. In the community wide&#xD;
      educational intervention, a baseline household survey was used to identify barriers to&#xD;
      hypertension control in the community. This information was used in planning the intervention&#xD;
      strategies, targeting the educational efforts, and developing the educational messages.&#xD;
      Existing community organizations (churches, local media, neighborhood organizations, etc)&#xD;
      were used to implement educational efforts over a three year period. Program success was&#xD;
      evaluated by comparing findings on a follow-up household survey with those at baseline. Level&#xD;
      of blood pressure control was the primary outcome measure. For the intensive educational&#xD;
      program for hypertensives, the investigators developed a hypertension registry of individuals&#xD;
      with high blood pressure who were identified from a number of community sources. All&#xD;
      individuals on the registry receive educational material through the mail. Individuals with&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension were randomized to receive the usual mailed educational materials&#xD;
      or a more intensive personalized 12 month intervention using lay health advisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the evaluation, the investigators compared blood pressure control morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      between these two intervention arms of the registry. The innovative educational approach to&#xD;
      health care providers utilized the existing community-based Area Health Education Center&#xD;
      (AHEC) network to communicate community-determined hypertension control needs and&#xD;
      community-determined hypertension control strategies to health care providers and students.&#xD;
      The research was designed to elucidate community factors in the inner city that dictated&#xD;
      strategies necessary for success in a variety inner city environments. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators examined the effect of community size and level of community stress (as&#xD;
      indicated by poverty, crime, etc.) on program development and outcome. To do this, they&#xD;
      implemented the program in one city-wide community (Milwaukee) and in three well defined,&#xD;
      homogeneous inner city neighborhoods of Chicago which had differing levels of community&#xD;
      stress indicators. They evaluated the effect of size and community stress levels on the&#xD;
      program strategies and successes.&#xD;
