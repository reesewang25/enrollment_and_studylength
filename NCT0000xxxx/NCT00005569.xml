  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of a protein called secretory leukocyte protease&#xD;
      inhibitor (SLPI), on skin wound healing. Produced naturally by the body, SLPI modifies levels&#xD;
      of elastase, a substance that breaks down the skin. Older people are at greater risk of&#xD;
      impaired wound healing, with increased elastase activity and inflammation. In addition, men&#xD;
      heal more slowly than women. Delayed healing is associated with infection and pain and can&#xD;
      lead to the development of chronic non-healing skin wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy men and women between 60 and 80 years old who wish to participate in this study will&#xD;
      have a brief history and physical evaluation to determine their eligibility. Those enrolled&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive a gel form of SLPI applied topically (on the skin&#xD;
      surface) to a skin wound or a placebo (a look-alike gel with no active ingredient).&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit - The skin will be numbed with a local anesthetic and two small (4 mm) wounds&#xD;
      (about the size of a pencil eraser) made in each upper arm. The drug or placebo will be&#xD;
      applied to the wound and gauze placed over it. Two blood samples (20 ml and 7 ml) will be&#xD;
      drawn an hour apart to determine blood levels of SLPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit - The day after the first visit, the wound dressing will be removed and the&#xD;
      participant will be evaluated for pain at the wound site, allergic reactions or infection. A&#xD;
      blood sample (7 ml) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit - The wounds will be examined and photographed to evaluate healing. In addition,&#xD;
      the strength of the wound may be assessed by means of a vacuum system placed on the skin.&#xD;
      (This may cause a tingling sensation over the wound.) A piece of all four wounds will be&#xD;
      removed after the skin has been numbed and a dressing applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth visit - The wounds will be examined for healing and the dressing removed.&#xD;

      The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of topically-applied&#xD;
      Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) peptide as a treatment for impaired wound&#xD;
      healing states in 60-80 year old subjects who are at greatest risk of delayed wound healing.&#xD;
      Administration of the drug topically should result in reduced elastase activity and&#xD;
      inflammation, leading to accelerated matrix deposition and wound healing. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of four possible groups: topical administration of SLPI or placebo&#xD;
      (wounds excised at day 7 post-wounding) or topical administration of SLPI or placebo (wounds&#xD;
      excised at day 50 post-wounding). The dose of SLPI will be determined in a dose-finding pilot&#xD;
      study prior to the main study. Initial 4mm punch biopsies will be made in both upper inner&#xD;
      arms (two per arm), followed by topical administration of SLPI or placebo. The wounds will be&#xD;
      left to heal and all four wounds excised at either day 7 (for 50% of the volunteers) or day&#xD;
      50 post-wounding (for the other 50% of volunteers). The incidence of side-effects, and the&#xD;
      rate of healing will be determined at these time-points. Successful demonstration of an&#xD;
      enhanced therapeutic effect may provide a basis for the development of strategies to&#xD;
      accelerate wound healing in those situations where it is comprised, such as with age and in&#xD;
      chronic non-healing wounds.&#xD;

        Healthy subjects will be used in the study to remove bias from associated&#xD;
        pathology/comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only Caucasian patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        One group of male volunteers of 60-80 years of age will be used for the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There will be two groups for the main study: one male and one female group (age-matched&#xD;
        equivalent groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females will be post-menopausal with the menarche at least 1 year previously and not taking&#xD;
        hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;

        No patients infected with Hepatitis B, C, non A/B virus or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy or lactating females will be excluded.&#xD;
