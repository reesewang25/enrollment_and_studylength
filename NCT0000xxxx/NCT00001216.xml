  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to allow researchers to use transelectrical stimulation to explore the&#xD;
      function of the human nervous system and improve diagnosis of neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial electrical stimulation is a non-invasive technique that can be used to stimulate&#xD;
      brain activity and gather information about brain function. Electrical stimulation involves&#xD;
      placing electrodes on the scalp or skin and passing an electrical current between them. When&#xD;
      this is done, an electrical field is created that activates areas of the brain that control&#xD;
      muscles. Muscle activity as a result of the stimulation can be recorded and analyzed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol application is written to permit us to use transcranial electrical stimulation,&#xD;
      a safe and noninvasive method for activating the brain, spinal cord, or proximal nerves&#xD;
      through the skin, in appropriate subjects. We will use this technique to explore the function&#xD;
      of the human central and peripheral nervous system and to aid in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      neurological disorders.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Males and females, ages 18 and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diverse racial groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Amputees and others with whom we will have no patient-care relationship may also be&#xD;
        considered to be volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be recruited from those referred to the Human Motor Control Section, NINDS&#xD;
        who have neurological syndromes that are of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        On rare occasions we may attempt to study children as young as 10 years with TES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals without indwelling cardiac lines and pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients recruited for study would come from those referred to the EMG laboratory and to&#xD;
        the Human Motor Control Clinic who would have distinct neurologic syndromes from well&#xD;
        defined peripheral and central nervous system lesions including hemiplegia from stroke,&#xD;
        trauma, tumor or focal demyelination (most commonly patients would have hemiplegia from&#xD;
        stroke), peripheral nerve lesions, amputations, spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers, including NIH employees, would be healthy adults without history of&#xD;
        physical examination evidence of neurologic disease and individuals with different types of&#xD;
        amputations involving upper and lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers may also be participants in the electrophysiological protocol (84-N-0196).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of epilepsy.&#xD;
