      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled drugs such as yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide can locate tumor&#xD;
      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide in&#xD;
      treating patients who have refractory small cell lung cancer or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tumor response rate of yttrium Y 90 SMT 487 in patients with&#xD;
      refractory small cell lung cancer or advanced metastatic breast cancer expressing&#xD;
      somatostatin receptor. II. Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in these patients.&#xD;
      III. Determine the overall survival of these patients with this treatment regimen. IV.&#xD;
      Determine the quality of life in these patients with this treatment regimen. V. Determine the&#xD;
      frequency of tumors which are positive (3+ or 4+) for OctreoScan scintigraphy in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive yttrium Y 90 SMT 487 IV over 10-15&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6-9 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at&#xD;
      course 3, week 6. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
