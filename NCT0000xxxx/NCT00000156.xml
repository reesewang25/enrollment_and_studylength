      To evaluate the effect of ambient light reduction on the incidence of retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity (ROP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite progress during the past decade in treatment of ROP, this disease still poses a&#xD;
      significant (approximately 2.1 percent) risk of blindness to extremely low birth-weight&#xD;
      (&lt;1,251 grams) preterm infants. Current estimates indicate that about 27,000 infants of&#xD;
      extremely low birth weight are born annually, of which 74 percent will survive. As techniques&#xD;
      of managing smaller and less mature preterm infants continue to improve, it is expected that&#xD;
      the number of infants at risk for blindness will continue to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For infants weighing less than 1,251 grams at birth, the Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of&#xD;
      Prematurity (CRYO-ROP) Study has shown that the risk of developing severe, acute (threshold)&#xD;
      ROP is 6 percent. Although cryotherapy, when applied at the time of threshold ROP, reduces&#xD;
      the rate of unfavorable visual outcome, 35 percent of eyes that develop this level of severe,&#xD;
      acute disease are blind 1 year after treatment. Moreover, cryotherapy is destructive. Even&#xD;
      when cryotherapy prevents progression to retinal detachment, it is associated with peripheral&#xD;
      retinal destruction and may, in some cases, be associated with subnormal central vision due&#xD;
      to high myopia and/or macular scarring. Corrective surgical treatments for retinal detachment&#xD;
      caused by ROP have proven to be of little visual benefit. A preventive treatment for ROP that&#xD;
      is safe, efficacious, easily applied, and inexpensive is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that reducing the amount of light that reaches the eyes of&#xD;
      preterm infants may be effective in preventing ROP. Although previous reports on the use of&#xD;
      light reduction to the eyes of preterm infants in the nursery have produced conflicting&#xD;
      results, there are sufficient reasons to believe that this strategy may be effective in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence and severity of ROP. These reasons center on the role of light in the&#xD;
      production of destructive free radicals. Supplemental oxygen produces the same free radicals,&#xD;
      and the two mechanisms may be additive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this masked, controlled study, infants weighing less than 1,251 grams at birth were&#xD;
      prospectively randomized within 24 hours of birth to wear goggles or not to wear goggles.&#xD;
      Goggles contain 97 percent near neutral density filters and were worn until the infant&#xD;
      reached either 31 weeks gestational age or 4 weeks postnatal age, whichever was longer. The&#xD;
      goggled and nongoggled infants were exposed to the same ambient light conditions within any&#xD;
      given Study Center. Eyes of all infants were examined on a prescribed schedule by certified&#xD;
      examiners to determine the incidence of any confirmed ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to answer the following question: Does light reduction&#xD;
      to the eyes of extremely low birth-weight infants decrease the incidence of any confirmed ROP&#xD;
      (at least 3 contiguous clock hours, any stage, any zone)? The primary end points are&#xD;
      therefore ROP or full vascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the following question: Does light&#xD;
      reduction to the eyes of extremely low birth-weight infants decrease the incidence of more&#xD;
      severe ROP (prethreshold ROP -- the secondary end point)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has recruited approximately 400 infants, equally divided into goggle-wearing and&#xD;
      control group. Since randomization must occur within 24 hours of birth, the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate a mortality rate of between 10 percent and 20 percent of enrollees prior to&#xD;
      outcome. The study is in the followup phase with regular ophthalmologic exams until either&#xD;
      ROP regression or normal full retinal vascularization is established. A final exam occurs at&#xD;
      adjusted age 6 months.&#xD;
