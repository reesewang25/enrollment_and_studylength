  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate mast cell precursors that circulate in the blood. In a group of&#xD;
      diseases collectively known as mastocytosis, mast cells accumulate in abnormal amounts in the&#xD;
      skin, lymphoid tissues, bone marrow, liver and spleen. Some forms of mastocytosis have a&#xD;
      generally good prognosis; for others, the prognosis is poorer. There is no known cure for any&#xD;
      form of the disease. A better understanding of mast cells and how they respond to certain&#xD;
      substances may provide insights that will lead to effective treatments for mastocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with systemic mastocytosis and normal healthy volunteers between the ages of 20 and&#xD;
      60 may be eligible for this 8-day study. Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 Medical history, physical examination, and blood tests to assess general health&#xD;
           status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 2 through 6 Daily injections under the skin of G-CSF a hormone that stimulates&#xD;
           white blood cell production&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 7 Leukapheresis a procedure for collecting large numbers of white blood cells. In&#xD;
           leukapheresis, blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm and channeled into a&#xD;
           cell separator machine. The white cells are collected and the rest of the blood is&#xD;
           returned to the body through a needle in the other arm. The procedure takes up to 3&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 7 and 8 Blood draw (about 1 teaspoon) to monitor white blood cell counts.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to obtain large numbers of CD34+ cells from the peripheral&#xD;
      blood of healthy volunteers and patients with systemic mastocytosis or other related&#xD;
      allergic, hematological, and immunological conditions by leukapheresis for culture and&#xD;
      characterization of mast cell progenitor cells and their response to various cytokines and&#xD;
      anti-mitotic agents. Healthy volunteers and patients will be adults of both sexes from 18 to&#xD;
      70 years of age. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) will be administered to&#xD;
      healthy volunteers at dose of 10 mcg/kg/day as a subcutaneous dose daily for 5 days not to&#xD;
      exceed 960mcg. Patients will receive Plerixafor at a dose of 0.24 mg/kg as a single&#xD;
      subcutaneous dose not to exceed 24mg the night before leukapheresis as a mobilizing agent for&#xD;
      CD34+ cells. In identified patients where leukapheresis yield is considered adequate without&#xD;
      stimulation by the principal investigator, leukapheresis may proceed without stimulation.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will undergo a single leukapheresis at day 7, and patients will undergo a&#xD;
      single leukapheresis at day 3 or 4. This is not a therapeutic protocol and does not involve&#xD;
      reinfusion of any manipulated cells, viruses or DNA constructs back into human subjects.&#xD;
