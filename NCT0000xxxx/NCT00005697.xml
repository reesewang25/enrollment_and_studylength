    <textblock>
      This 31-month supplement to Sustaining Women's Smoking Cessation Postpartum (Project PANDA)&#xD;
      designed, implemented, and evaluated an intensified intervention for pregnant women who were&#xD;
      unable to stop smoking with minimal assistance.&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The substudy was a population-based experiment with White, Black, and Hispanic pregnant women&#xD;
      whose continued smoking made them ineligible for randomization into the parent study. It was&#xD;
      unique in focusing on heavier, more addicted pregnant smokers. PANDA research sites and&#xD;
      protocols offered a special opportunity for a low cost test of a disseminable intervention&#xD;
      which this project team was uniquely qualified to design and implement. The new intervention,&#xD;
      One- to-One, used telephone counselors to assess the counselee's stage in the change process&#xD;
      and give stage-appropriate messages, using established techniques of motivational&#xD;
      interviewing. Between the two counselor calls spaced 10 days apart, counselees received&#xD;
      personalized written feedback and suggestions. The primary aim, increasing quitting during&#xD;
      pregnancy, was assessed by unobtrusive urine samples taken during prenatal visits in the&#xD;
      ninth month and identified only by study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of postpartum interviews with subsample cotinine validation was used to examine the&#xD;
      second important aim, reduction of infant smoke exposure. A combination of messages, peer&#xD;
      modeling, and support helped women sustain cessation after delivery and eliminate smoking&#xD;
      around the baby. Project PANDA videotapes and newsletters already contained these messages&#xD;
      and required only minimal supplementation to be used with the One-to-One experimental group,&#xD;
      regardless of their success in quitting in pregnancy. As in Project PANDA, the assessments&#xD;
      were separated from the experiment by enrolling subjects in a university-sponsored study of&#xD;
      new mothers' health practices and baby care and by presenting the program as usual care by&#xD;
      the health care site.&#xD;
