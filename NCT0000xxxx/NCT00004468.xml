      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of orally administered calcitriol&#xD;
      in patients with at least 5% of their body covered with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of topically administered calcitriol in&#xD;
      patients with at least 5% of their body covered with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the topical calcitriol treatment to the oral calcitriol treatment in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a part placebo-controlled (arm I) study. Patients either apply&#xD;
      topical petrolatum (Vaseline) with calcitriol (vitamin D3) on a psoriatic lesion daily and&#xD;
      petrolatum only on an other similar lesion daily to serve as a control (arm I) or receive&#xD;
      oral calcitriol nightly (arm II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I patients continue treatment for at least 2 months. At the end of 2 months of topical&#xD;
      treatment, one biopsy is taken of the lesion treated with calcitriol, one biopsy of the&#xD;
      lesion treated with petrolatum alone, and one biopsy of skin unaffected by psoriasis. Lesions&#xD;
      are also photographed prior to therapy, 2-4 weeks during therapy for the first two months,&#xD;
      then once every 1-3 months, and then once at end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II patients increase dosage of oral calcitriol every 2 weeks up to a maximum dosage daily&#xD;
      in the absence of adverse effects (high urinary calcium or serum calcium levels). Patients&#xD;
      continue treatment for at least 1 month. Lesions are photographed prior to therapy, 2-4 weeks&#xD;
      during therapy, and then once at end of treatment.&#xD;
