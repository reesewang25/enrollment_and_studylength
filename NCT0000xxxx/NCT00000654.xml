      To determine the tolerance of HIV-infected patients to TID oral doses of FIAU syrup at 4&#xD;
      different dose levels. To determine the peak and trough blood levels of FIAU and its&#xD;
      metabolites during two weeks of oral dosing with FIAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pyrimidine nucleoside analog FIAC and its primary deaminated uracil metabolite FIAU are&#xD;
      highly and specifically active compounds in vitro against several herpes group viruses,&#xD;
      particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, varicella zoster (VZV), and&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV). Since FIAU is the primary&#xD;
      metabolite of FIAC and the administration of FIAU simplifies the metabolism of FIAC, it is&#xD;
      anticipated from clinical studies of FIAC that FIAU will be tolerated at least as well as&#xD;
      FIAC. A single-dose, pharmacokinetic (blood level) study showed that FIAC, when taken orally,&#xD;
      is readily absorbed into the bloodstream, and most of it is converted to FIAU. Daily oral&#xD;
      doses are expected to provide concentrations of FIAU exceeding the in vitro minimum&#xD;
      inhibitory concentration for nearly all the herpes group viruses.&#xD;

      particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, varicella zoster (VZV), and&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV). Since FIAU is the primary&#xD;

      doses are expected to provide concentrations of FIAU exceeding the in vitro minimum&#xD;
      inhibitory concentration for nearly all the herpes group viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with Karnofsky scores at least 80 (with or without documented recurrent&#xD;
      herpes group infections) are successively entered into consecutively studied, escalating dose&#xD;
      cohorts. There are a total of 4 dose cohorts of FIAU and each patient takes the required&#xD;
      amount of FIAU syrup every 8 hours, 1 hour prior to or 3 hours after meals, for a total of 14&#xD;
      days. Entry of new patients at the next higher dose is based on results of tolerance and&#xD;
      safety data for prior cohort when all 10 have received 14 days of therapy and at least 7 have&#xD;
      met all of the tolerance criteria. Although not formally randomized due to the sequential&#xD;
      nature of the study and serious medical condition of the patients, every attempt to avoid&#xD;
      bias in assigning a patient to a dose is made. Patients are entered starting with the first&#xD;
      dose cohort. Upon meeting the enrollment and tolerance criteria for dose escalation, up to 5&#xD;
      patients with a history of chronic HBV infection and surface antigen positive at their&#xD;
      screening visit are added to the end of each dose cohort. Plasma samples are taken to&#xD;
      determine peak and trough levels of FIAU at Days 1, 3, 7, and 14 or at last visit. Patients&#xD;
      with ongoing active infections are followed by culture (HSV, VZV and CMV) or test (HBV) at&#xD;
      Days 1, 3, 7, and 14. Antiemetic therapy with Reglan, Compazine, and Trilafon is given&#xD;
      concomitantly at the discretion of the investigator and tolerance determined with antiemetic&#xD;
      therapy ongoing. Patients are advised to avoid heavy exercise within 24 hours of any&#xD;
      laboratory tests.&#xD;
