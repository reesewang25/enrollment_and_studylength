  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to use PET scans in order to measure activity of the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is the portion of the nervous system that&#xD;
      maintains a normal supply of blood and fuel to organs during stressful situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET scan or Positron Emission Tomography is an advanced form of an X-ray. It is used to&#xD;
      detect radioactive substances in the body. During this study researchers plan to inject small&#xD;
      amounts of the radioactive drug fluorodopamine into patients. Fluorodopamine is very similar&#xD;
      to the chemicals found in the sympathetic nervous system. It can attach to sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      endings and allow researchers to view them with the aid of a PET scan. One area of the body&#xD;
      with many sympathetic nerve endings is the heart. After giving a dose of fluorodopamine,&#xD;
      researchers will be able to visualize all of the sympathetic nerve endings involved in the&#xD;
      activity of the heart. In addition, this diagnostic test will help researchers detect&#xD;
      abnormalities of the nervous system of patient's hearts.&#xD;

      This project applies positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning after administration of&#xD;
      6-[18F]fluorodopamine ([18F]-6F-DA) to visualize sympathetic innervation and function in&#xD;
      patients with neurocardiologic disorders. Patients undergo infusion of [18F]-6F-DA, followed&#xD;
      by PET scanning of one or more body regions. Patients may also undergo PET scanning after&#xD;
      administration of [13N]-ammonia, to assess regional perfusion; regional blood sampling&#xD;
      (including sampling from the coronary sinus or great cardiac vein) during infusion of&#xD;
      [3H]-l-norepinephrine ([3H]-NE), to assess the kinetics and metabolism of NE; or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) to delineate the ventricular myocardium. PET scanning after&#xD;
      [18F]-6F-DA administration, in conjunction with other clinical assessment tools, should&#xD;
      provide comprehensive information about regional sympathoneural innervation and function in&#xD;
      neurocardiologic disorders.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects are adult patients in one of the following diagnostic categories: coronary&#xD;
        heart disease or chest pain and normal coronary arteries; myocardial dysfunction or&#xD;
        failure; hypertension; or dysautonomia. Groups of appropriately matched healthy volunteers&#xD;
        are studied concurrently as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Minors are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects in whom anatomic factors complicate vascular access are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are not expected clinically to tolerate recumbency during the procedures are&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or lactating women are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiology patients may be tested while off their usual medications. In this situation, the&#xD;
        patients will be inpatients on the cardiology ward, managed clinically by staff of the&#xD;
        Cardiology Branch, DIR, NHLBI. Hypertensives will be tested afer having discontinued&#xD;
        anti-hypertensive medications for up to two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who must take medications continually in the following categories are excluded:&#xD;
        anticoagulants, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, aspirin, acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients unable to discontinue nicotine or alcohol temporarily are excluded.&#xD;
