      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite extensive research over many years, noninvasive methods for detection of the presence&#xD;
      and severity of coronary artery disease remain imperfect, in part due to the fact that&#xD;
      different, partially interrelated, facets of coronary atherosclerosis may predispose to&#xD;
      different manifestations (e.g., luminal diameter narrowing to myocardial ischemia and wall&#xD;
      plaque burden to a higher risk or acute thrombosis). One noninvasive index of the degree of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis, the extent of coronary artery calcification, has become more&#xD;
      accessible to non-invasive evaluation due to the development of fast electron-beam computed&#xD;
      tomography (EBCT). Initial studies have shown that EBCT coronary calcification is related to&#xD;
      a variety of coronary risk factors and is also predictive to a variable extent in different&#xD;
      populations of incident coronary heart disease events, but few data are available concerning&#xD;
      the evolution of EBCT-detected coronary calcification and its relation to coronary risk&#xD;
      factors or to prevalent or incident coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study draws on the success of the Los Angeles South Bay Heart Watch (SBHW) in recruiting&#xD;
      an ethnically-diverse sample of individuals at high risk of coronary heart disease events who&#xD;
      have undergone serial evaluation by both assessment of conventional coronary heart disease&#xD;
      risk factors and by evaluation of coronary arterial calcification by fluoroscopy and by EBCT&#xD;
      on sequential evaluations. The study group has been able to maintain contact with the&#xD;
      participants and achieve outstanding rates of both contact for follow-up and repeat&#xD;
      participation in sequential components of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study follows up 1,000 asymptomatic high-risk survivors from the South Bay Heart Watch&#xD;
      population recruited in 1990-1992 (n = 1,461) and studied with EBCT in 1992-1993 (n = 1,309).&#xD;
      The primary objective is to examine the effects of baseline risk factors and measures of&#xD;
      calcium metabolism on changes in the amount of coronary calcium in this asymptomatic&#xD;
      high-risk adult cohort. This observational study has the following specific aims, as follow:&#xD;
      1) relating demographic factors and traditional risk factors to progression in coronary&#xD;
      artery calcification (CAC) score over time; 2) relating serum markers of calcium metabolism&#xD;
      to changes in CAC score; and 3) relating baseline CAC score and changes in CAC score to left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction and intervening coronary events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SBHW cohort and NHLBI reading center as well as Dr. Azen's data coordinating center are&#xD;
      used to examine whether baseline risk factors, ethnic group and indices of calcium metabolism&#xD;
      are associated with change in coronary calcium quantity over four to five years. EBCT scans&#xD;
      are performed in 1,000 surviving members of the cohort as are repeat measurements of left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy, plasma lipids, blood pressure, homocysteine, fibrinogen,&#xD;
      para-thyroid hormone and vitamin D levels. The independent relationships between risk factors&#xD;
      are examined from the 1994 baseline evaluation and the change in coronary calcium score as&#xD;
      determined by EBCT. Logistic regression, which is not dependent on normality of the&#xD;
      independent variables, will be used to examine the relation of annualized change in coronary&#xD;
      calcium with the incidence of events. The study continues through August, 2008.&#xD;
