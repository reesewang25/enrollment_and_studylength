      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current government physical fitness guidelines state that: 1) the majority of the health&#xD;
      benefits from physical activity can be obtained by walking two miles briskly on most days of&#xD;
      the week; and 2) the health benefits of physical activity depend principally on the total&#xD;
      amount of activity rather than the intensity of the activity. Nevertheless, there are&#xD;
      currently no prospective epidemiological studies extant, designed specifically to directly&#xD;
      contrast the health benefits and costs of moderate exercise (e.g., walking) versus vigorous&#xD;
      exercise (e.g., running).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of the study, 233,000 person-years of follow-up had been accumulated in&#xD;
      56,000 runners (between 1991 and 1997). The runners were resurveyed in 1997 along with 68,000&#xD;
      walkers. The walkers were also solicited through the publication of the questionnaire in&#xD;
      Walking magazine followed by a direct mailing of the questionnaire to 425,000 subscribers.&#xD;
      Total and cause-specific mortality will be determined from the National Death Index; fatal&#xD;
      and nonfatal cancers will be identified from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance,&#xD;
      Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and 46 state registries; nonfatal coronary heart disease&#xD;
      and injuries will be determined from questionnaires. Survival analyses will be used to test&#xD;
      whether runners have greater reduction in heart disease, total mortality, and cancer per unit&#xD;
      of exercise. Exercise-related injuries from walking and running will also be examined. Power&#xD;
      calculations suggest that detection of differences between runners and walkers, as small as&#xD;
      11% for total mortality, 16% for CHD, 12% for total cancers, and 36% for breast cancer, will&#xD;
      be possible. The differences will be adjusted for weekly kilocalories expended by walking and&#xD;
      running, for walking and running distance, and for time spent on each activity to test&#xD;
      whether these variables account for differences in disease rates between walkers and runners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of the study, 517,000 person years in 68,000 runners (between 1991 and 2001) will&#xD;
      be available for analysis. Survival analysis will be used to test for a dose-response&#xD;
      relationship between running mileage and CHD and cancer risk, and whether this relationship&#xD;
      is affected by running intensity, running frequency, running history, gender, adiposity, age&#xD;
      or medication use. Using conservative rates (25% below published values), statistical power&#xD;
      calculations suggest that detectable reduction in coronary heart disease risk as small as&#xD;
      0.71% per mile will be possible, which is far below the estimated reduction from other&#xD;
      published studies (2.1%). Additionally, a detectable reduction in breast cancer risk as small&#xD;
      as 1.5% per mile run in women is calculated, which is below the 1.7% reduction in risk&#xD;
      estimated from other published data.&#xD;
