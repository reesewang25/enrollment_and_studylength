      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a family-centered, community-based,&#xD;
      self-management intervention (Self-Management Therapy) for adolescents with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      The study will test the intervention's effectiveness in improving the adolescents' behavior,&#xD;
      thinking, mood, and use of substances such as drugs and alcohol. The study also will look at&#xD;
      the effects of the patient on the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention involves training in recognizing symptoms of schizophrenia and in stress&#xD;
      management, problem-solving, and social skills. Parents and siblings are included to gain&#xD;
      knowledge and skills to support the adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Self-Management Therapy intervention is administered in small multiple-family groups in&#xD;
      12 sessions over 7-1/2 months. The effects of the intervention on the patient and his/her&#xD;
      family are assessed prior to treatment, after 6 sessions, after 12 sessions, and in a&#xD;
      follow-up visit 6 months after completion of sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child may be eligible for this study if he/she:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is 15 to 19 years old and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To test the effectiveness of a family-centered, community-based, self-management intervention&#xD;
      (Self-Management Therapy) for adolescents with schizophrenia. The primary aim is to test its&#xD;
      effectiveness in improving the adolescents' level of functioning in role performance,&#xD;
      thinking/cognitive processing, behavior towards others, mood, and use of substances. The&#xD;
      second aim is to assess the impact of the intervention on family functioning. The third aim&#xD;
      is to describe the relationships among the process variables of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nakagawa-Kogan's self-management nursing model, Kanfer's self-regulation theory, and&#xD;
      Liberman's theory of stress and vulnerability provide the theoretical basis for the&#xD;
      self-management intervention developed specifically for a population with deficits in&#xD;
      cognitive processing. The intervention involves training in symptom awareness, stress&#xD;
      management skills, problem-solving, and social skills. Parents and siblings are included to&#xD;
      gain knowledge and skills to support the adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adolescent's level of functioning is assessed using the Child and Adolescent Functional&#xD;
      Assessment Scale, the Birchwood Early Signs &amp; Symptoms Scale for schizophrenia, and the DISA.&#xD;
      Family Functioning is assessed by computing a Composite Family Functioning Index using&#xD;
      weighted scores from the FACES II, Family Apgar, Family Empowerment, and Family Social&#xD;
      Support scales. One parent is designated by the family to be the family respondent on the&#xD;
      scales. The adolescents are referred to the study by mental health professionals. The&#xD;
      intervention is administered in small multiple-family groups in 12 sessions over 7-1/2&#xD;
      months. Data are collected at 4 points in time: at baseline, after 6 intensive sessions,&#xD;
      after 6 monthly reinforcement sessions, and 6 months post-intervention. ANCOVA is used to&#xD;
      test the study hypotheses. Multivariate relationships are examined among the process&#xD;
      variables of the intervention.&#xD;
