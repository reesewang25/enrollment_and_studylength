      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, before&#xD;
      a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of tumor cells. It may&#xD;
      also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem&#xD;
      cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining tumor cells&#xD;
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted&#xD;
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving&#xD;
      cyclosporine with or without mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate after the transplant may&#xD;
      stop this from happening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well peripheral stem cell transplant works in&#xD;
      treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the antitumor effect of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation&#xD;
           (PBSCT) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicity of a nonmyeloablative, low-intensity, preparative&#xD;
           regimen followed by an HLA-matched allogeneic PBSCT in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine engraftment by measuring donor-recipient chimerism in lymphoid and myeloid&#xD;
           lineages in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the relationship between donor-host chimerism and the incidence of acute and&#xD;
           chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of lymphocyte infusions on donor-host chimerism in this patient&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the response rate, disease-free survival, overall survival, and mortality from&#xD;
           the procedure or tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonmyeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive 1 of 3 preparative regimens prior&#xD;
           to peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation. (Regimens 2 and 3 closed to&#xD;
           accrual as of 10/1/03.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 1: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7 and -6 and&#xD;
                fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 2 (closed to accrual as of 10/1/03): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV&#xD;
                over 1 hour on days -7 and -6, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1, and&#xD;
                antithymocyte globulin on days -5 to -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 3 (closed to accrual as of 10/1/03): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV&#xD;
                over 1 hour on days -8 to -6, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1, and&#xD;
                antithymocyte globulin on days -5 to -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBPC transplantation: Patients undergo mobilized CD34+ PBPC transplantation on day 0.&#xD;
           PBPC transplantation may be repeated on days 1 and 2, if deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive 1 of 3 GVHD prophylaxis&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 1 (closed to accrual as of 10/17/00): Patients receive cyclosporine IV over&#xD;
                12 hours or orally beginning on day -4 and continuing for up to approximately 3&#xD;
                months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 2 (open to accrual from 10/17/00 through 2/11/02): Patients receive&#xD;
                cyclosporine as in regimen 1. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen 3 (open to accrual as of 2/11/02): Patients receive cyclosporine as in&#xD;
                regimen 1. Patients also receive methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor lymphocyte infusions: Patients with progressive disease on days 15-30, day 60, or&#xD;
           day 100, without GVHD, receive infusion(s) of donor lymphocytes. Further donor&#xD;
           lymphocyte infusions after day 100 may be given at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
           physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every&#xD;
      6 months for 2Â½ years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
