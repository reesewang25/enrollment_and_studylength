      To compare three accepted modes of myocardial preservation, warm, tepid, and cold blood&#xD;
      cardioplegia, coinciding with normothermic (37 degrees centigrade), tepid (32 degrees&#xD;
      centigrade) and hypothermic (8 to 10 degrees centigrade) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to&#xD;
      define differences in neurologic function in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study of warm versus cold perfusion and preservation was completed in 32 patients&#xD;
      prior to the ongoing study. The findings of the pilot study showed 53 percent of patients had&#xD;
      evidence of new neurologic disturbance at postoperative day four. Only the neurologic&#xD;
      dysfunction could be correlated with warm versus cold perfusion (37.5 percent warm versus 75&#xD;
      percent cold, P less than 0.05). The changes in neurologic function had abated or clearly&#xD;
      improved by one month of follow-up, and the distinction in neurologic dysfunction grading was&#xD;
      no longer apparent between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to cold, tepid, or warm blood cardioplegia, coinciding with&#xD;
      normothermic, tepid, and hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. All patients received a standard&#xD;
      anesthetic protocol combining narcotic and inhalational anesthesia. Each patient entering the&#xD;
      study had extensive clinical data collected prospectively incorporating most aspects of&#xD;
      measurable determinants related to myocardial preservation. Additionally, neurologic tests&#xD;
      were performed by a blinded neurologist and rated by an objective scoring system, the Mathew&#xD;
      scale. The studies were performed preoperatively, on the third or fourth postoperative day,&#xD;
      and at one month following surgery. Hematologic data were measured for fibrinolytic&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
