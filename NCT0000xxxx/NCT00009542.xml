  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how kava-a widely used herbal remedy-may affect the body's&#xD;
      elimination of other medicines. Many people take kava to reduce anxiety or cause sedation.&#xD;
      Since this product is considered a food supplement and not a drug, it is not subject to the&#xD;
      rigorous pre-market testing required for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. As a&#xD;
      result, information has not been collected on possible interactions between kava and other&#xD;
      medications. This study will look at how kava affects the elimination of caffeine-a compound&#xD;
      commonly found in chocolate, coffee, tea and soft drinks-and dextromethorphan-an OTC cough&#xD;
      suppressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 30-day study.&#xD;
      Candidates will provide a medical history and undergo a physical examination and routine&#xD;
      blood tests. Women of childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will not drink alcoholic beverages or take any medications (except those&#xD;
      given in the study) for 2 weeks prior to the study and throughout its duration. In addition,&#xD;
      they will abstain from caffeine, grapefruit and grapefruit juice and charbroiled foods for at&#xD;
      least 72 hours before and throughout each study day that urine is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of the study, study subjects will take one dose each of caffeine and&#xD;
      dextromethorphan at 4:00 P.M.. They will empty their bladder before the dosing and then&#xD;
      collect all their urine after the dosing for the rest of the day and including the next&#xD;
      mornings first urine. They will bring the urine samples to the Clinical Center when the&#xD;
      collection is complete. This procedure will be repeated 1 week later (study day 8). After the&#xD;
      second urine collection is completed, subjects will take 200 milligrams of kava 3 times a day&#xD;
      for 21 days. On study day 29 (after 21 days of kava), subjects will repeat the&#xD;
      dextromethorphan and caffeine dosing and urine collection described above, while continuing&#xD;
      to take kava.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have an electroencephalograph (EEG) done before starting kava and again at the&#xD;
      end of kava (study day 30). For this procedure, several electrodes (metal cups attached to&#xD;
      wires) are secured to the scalp with a glue-like substance. A conductive gel fills the space&#xD;
      between the electrode and the scalp to ensure good contact. The electrodes will remain in&#xD;
      place for about 2 hours and then removed. The subject lies quietly on a bed during the EEG&#xD;
      recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will end with another physical examination and blood tests&#xD;
      following the second EEG and urine collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kava (piper methysticum) is a complementary or alternative medication used for purported&#xD;
      anxiolytic and sedative effects. Despite its widespread use there is no data regarding&#xD;
      potential for drug interactions or its effects on the electroencephalogram. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the effect of administration of kava for 3 weeks on the activity&#xD;
      of cytochrome p450, 1A2, 2D6, 3A4; NAT2, and XO. Additionally, the effect of kava on EEG&#xD;
      measured beta amplitude will be evaluated. Fifteen healthy volunteers will undergo enzyme&#xD;
      activity phenotyping by ingesting 2 mg/kg of caffeine and 30 mg of dextromethorphan followed&#xD;
      by an overnight urine collection. Following completion of two separate baseline evaluations,&#xD;
      separated by 1 week, subjects will then take 1 capsule containing 60 mg of kavalactones three&#xD;
      times daily for 3 weeks. Following 3 weeks of therapy subjects will undergo repeat enzyme&#xD;
      activity phenotyping as described previously. Enzyme activity following 3 weeks of kava will&#xD;
      be compared to pre-treatment values to characterize the magnitude of inhibition and/or&#xD;
      induction of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, NAT2, and XO activity. Additionally, subjects will have&#xD;
      EEG testing performed to evaluate the effect of kava on beta amplitude. EEG's will be&#xD;
      performed the day before the first baseline phenotyping procedure and then following three&#xD;
      weeks of kava (the day before the final phenotyping procedure). Beta amplitude following&#xD;
      three weeks of kava will be compared to pre-treatment values to evaluate the magnitude of&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effect. The results of this study will be used to facilitate the development&#xD;
      of protocols to evaluate the magnitude of interactions between clinically relevant&#xD;
      traditional medications and kava as well as studies to compare the pharmacologic effect of&#xD;
      kava to the effects of benzodiazepines.&#xD;
