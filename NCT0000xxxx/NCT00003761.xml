      This protocol is designed to evaluate the side effects of rV-DF3/MUC1 and to determine the&#xD;
      safest dose which should be used in the treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity associated with repeated vaccination with recombinant&#xD;
      vaccinia DF3/MUC1 vaccine (rV-DF3/MUC1) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. II.&#xD;
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose of rV-DF3/MUC1, based on cellular and humoral immunity,&#xD;
      in these patients. III. Determine whether vaccination with rV-DF3/MUC1 is associated with&#xD;
      antitumor activity in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive recombinant vaccinia&#xD;
      DF3/MUC1 vaccine (rV-DF3/MUC1) intradermally. Treatment repeats every month for 3 courses in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of at least 6 patients&#xD;
      receive escalating doses of rV-DF3/MUC1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest&#xD;
      dose level to be tested is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.&#xD;

    <description>- The starting dose for this Phase I study of rV-DF3/MUC1 will be 4.76 x 106 PFU.&#xD;
-- Dose escalation will proceed with cohorts of at least 6 patients as follows: Per vaccination&#xD;
Level 1 4.76 x 106 PFU&#xD;
Level 2 4.76 x 107 PFU&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             breast. Patients may have measurable disease, but it is not required. Patients may&#xD;
             have received any number of prior therapies for metastatic disease. Untreated patients&#xD;
             are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG = Performance Status of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a WBC &gt; 2000/mm 3 and a platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function documented by a serum creatinine &lt; 2.0&#xD;
             mg/d1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate liver function demonstrated by a serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0&#xD;
             mg/di, and a SGPT &lt; 4 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥3 weeks since chemotherapy (&gt; 6 weeks for nitosoureas or mitomycin C), hormonal&#xD;
             therapy or radiation therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be allergic to eggs.&#xD;
