  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (the highest&#xD;
      dose that can be given safely) of recombinant Interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in HIV-infected children.&#xD;
      This study also evaluates the effect of rIL-2 on the immune system of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2 is a substance naturally produced by the body's white blood cells that plays an&#xD;
      important role in helping the body fight infection. HIV-infected patients do not produce&#xD;
      enough IL-2, and it is hoped that the use of rIL-2 may improve immune system function in&#xD;
      these patients. First, it is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of this drug&#xD;
      in HIV-infected children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to study records, IL-2 has not been tested in HIV-infected children. Experience&#xD;
      with IL-2 in pediatric populations is extremely limited. Pahwa et al. gave 30,000 units/kg&#xD;
      daily IV to a child with severe combined immunodeficiency. This dose was well tolerated and&#xD;
      the patient improved clinically as well as immunologically. Part A is necessary to determine&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 in infected children. Part B will determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of the maximum tolerated dose in infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Children will receive rIL-2 intravenously for 5 days every 8 weeks for 3 cycles. The&#xD;
      study will enroll 4 patients in each of 3 dose levels. Dose escalation may occur if all 4&#xD;
      patients in a dose level tolerate therapy without evidence of Grade 3 (or higher) toxicity.&#xD;
      If 1 of 4 subjects in any dose level experiences at least Grade 3 toxicity, 2 additional&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in that dose level. If 1 of these 2 additional patients experiences&#xD;
      at least Grade 3 toxicity, dose escalation will not proceed. NOTE: Once Part A is completed&#xD;
      and the maximum tolerated dose is established, children who participated in Part A and&#xD;
      received less than the maximum tolerated dose will be offered additional therapy consisting&#xD;
      of 3 cycles of rIL-2 at the maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Children will receive rIL-2 intravenously at the maximum tolerated dose established&#xD;
      in part A. Treatment will be given for 5 days every 8 weeks for 3 cycles. [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      6/4/98: Children will receive rIL-2 intravenously at the lowest dose for 5 days every 8 weeks&#xD;
      for 6 cycles. Patients who received this dose in part A will also be offered this regimen.]&#xD;
