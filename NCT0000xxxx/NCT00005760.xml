      This study is for women who have already decided to undergo liposuction at Georgetown&#xD;
      University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. To take part in this study, a woman must first&#xD;
      meet with the plastic surgeons there, and be accepted by them to have liposuction. This study&#xD;
      will investigate whether large volume liposuction improves risk factors for heart disease in&#xD;
      overweight women with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or elevated&#xD;
      blood insulin levels. Large volume liposuction is the surgical removal of at least 10 pounds&#xD;
      (4.5 kg) of body fat, usually from the abdomen, hips or chest. Risk factors for heart disease&#xD;
      include high blood pressure and elevated levels of blood lipids (cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglycerides), blood glucose (sugar), and blood insulin. Subjects who participate in all&#xD;
      parts of this study will receive a total of $930.00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight women 18 years or older with high blood insulin levels, impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, or type 2 diabetes, who are planning to have large volume liposuction performed at&#xD;
      Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., may be eligible for this study. For&#xD;
      a subject to be accepted into this study, she must first meet with the plastic surgeons at&#xD;
      Georgetown University Medical Center, and they have to agree to perform large volume&#xD;
      liposuction. The decision that someone is suitable for liposuction is not under the control&#xD;
      of the NIH or of any NIH investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures at four separate times - before&#xD;
      undergoing liposuction, 4 weeks after surgery, 4 months after surgery and 1 year after&#xD;
      surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body measurements - taken with calipers to measure several skinfold thicknesses (the&#xD;
           width of a fat fold) and with a tape measure to measure the circumference of parts of&#xD;
           the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample and 6-hour urine collection - to test for pregnancy and to evaluate kidney&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose tolerance test - measures insulin sensitivity and how the body uses sugar, how&#xD;
           well insulin works, and insulin sensitivity. The procedure involves placement of two&#xD;
           catheters (thin, flexible tubes) through a needle into a vein in each arm. Sugar water&#xD;
           is infused into one catheter and 20 minutes into the test a small amount of insulin is&#xD;
           injected. Blood samples are drawn from the other catheter at frequent intervals for a&#xD;
           total of 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography - measure the heart's electrical activity&#xD;
           and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan - produces images for measuring body fat in&#xD;
           the abdomen. (not done at the 4-week visit). Takes about half an hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA X-ray - measures body fat, muscle and bone mineral content. Takes about half an hour&#xD;
           to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bod Pod - capsule-like device used to determine the proportion of body weight composed&#xD;
           of fat and non-fat tissue. Takes less than 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioelectric impedance analysis device - measures the proportions of body fat based on&#xD;
           electrical conduction of a small electric current. Takes 2-3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour blood pressure monitoring - a device attached to a blood pressure cuff strapped&#xD;
           to the arm measures blood pressure every 15 to 30 minutes continuously for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular reactivity tests - a blood pressure cuff is inflated for about 4 minutes before&#xD;
           deflating, providing information on the function of the small blood vessels in the skin,&#xD;
           as well as an idea of the function level of small blood vessels elsewhere in the body.&#xD;
           Takes half an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples - collected to evaluate kidney and liver function and to measure body&#xD;
           lipids, such as cholesterol, minerals, and other substances.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major predisposing factor for future Type 2 diabetes because it is often&#xD;
      associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance has&#xD;
      been suggested as the common link for other aspects of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome that&#xD;
      includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and macrovascular arterial disease. There are&#xD;
      racial disparities in the prevalence of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes: Compared with&#xD;
      non-Hispanic Caucasians, African American women have almost twice the prevalence of&#xD;
      overweight, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because data from predominantly Caucasian populations suggest that the quantity of truncal&#xD;
      (sometimes called upper body) adipose tissue, which includes the adipose tissue surrounding&#xD;
      the abdominal viscera, is far more important for risk stratification than that found in the&#xD;
      limbs or buttocks, which contain subcutaneous adipose tissue, it has been presumed that&#xD;
      attempts at treatment of obesity should concentrate on reducing visceral fat. However,&#xD;
      despite their greater risks for the complications of obesity, African Americans have less&#xD;
      visceral abdominal adipose tissue than Caucasians matched for body weight. Further, recent&#xD;
      metabolic studies suggest that upper body subcutaneous adipose tissue may play a significant&#xD;
      role, particularly for African Americans, in the comorbid metabolic conditions associated&#xD;
      with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of the large volume liposuction technique, selective removal of substantial&#xD;
      quantities of subcutaneous adipose tissue has become possible. It is unknown whether the&#xD;
      complications of obesity can be ameliorated by removal of subcutaneous adipose tissue, but&#xD;
      one preliminary study suggests that fasting hyperinsulinism can be improved by this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a pilot study of 10 patients (five Caucasians and five&#xD;
      African-Americans) who plan to undergo liposuction. We will investigate how large volume&#xD;
      liposuction affects the metabolic complications of obesity in overweight patients who have&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes. We will investigate the&#xD;
      effects of liposuction on various indices of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome by performing&#xD;
      studies of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism at four time points: before large volume&#xD;
      liposuction, 1 month after liposuction, 4 months after liposuction, and 1 year after&#xD;
      liposuction. At each visit we will study body composition, blood pressure, cardiac function,&#xD;
      dietary habits, insulin insensitivity, free fatty acids, and lipid profiles.&#xD;

        Obesity: Defined as subjects having a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2). Weight must&#xD;
        be less than 300 lb (136 kg) because of limits related to the DXA and CT scanners.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Volunteers with uncontrolled, significant or evolving psychiatric/psychological syndromes&#xD;
        which in the opinion of the investigators would place the patient at increased risk during&#xD;
        the course of the study or would impede competence and/or ability to complete the study are&#xD;
