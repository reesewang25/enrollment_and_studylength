      RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for p53 into a person's tumor may improve the body's ability to&#xD;
      fight cancer or make the cancer more sensitive to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients who&#xD;
      have recurrent head and neck cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the objective response rate of Ad5CMV-p53 in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Evaluate the duration of response, time to&#xD;
      disease progression, and overall survival of these patients after this treatment. III.&#xD;
      Evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5CMV-p53 in reducing cancer morbidity (pain assessment,&#xD;
      analgesic consumption, and Karnofsky performance status). IV. Assess the quality of life of&#xD;
      these patients receiving this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open label study. All patients receive direct intratumoral&#xD;
      injections of Ad5CMV-p53 on days 1, 2, and 3 of each 4-week treatment course. Patients are&#xD;
      treated for at least 2 courses barring local disease progression or unacceptable adverse&#xD;
      events; patients with responding or stable disease receive a maximum of 12 courses. Patients&#xD;
      are evaluated for safety 4 weeks from the completion of the last treatment. Quality of life&#xD;
      is assessed before, during, and after treatment. Patients are followed every 2 months for up&#xD;
      to 18 months or until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
