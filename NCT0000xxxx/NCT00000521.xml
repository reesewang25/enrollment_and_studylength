      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1970, children and adolescents with hypertension have been detected with increasing&#xD;
      frequency. Many of them were thought to have primary or essential hypertension and it&#xD;
      remained unclear how they should be managed. Additionally, since tracking of blood pressure&#xD;
      occurred even in early life, it was believed that youngsters with blood pressures&#xD;
      persistently in the upper deciles for age were at increased risk for later hypertension. No&#xD;
      clinical trials had been performed in this age group to examine the effects of&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic or drug therapy in lowering blood pressure. The trial was one of the first&#xD;
      attempts to examine the effects of a nutritional intervention on the rate of rise of blood&#xD;
      pressure in late childhood and early adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, partial-blind. After 19,542 fifth to eighth grade students were screened, 210&#xD;
      (105 boys and 105 girls) from the upper 15 percentiles of blood pressure distribution were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of three groups: low sodium diet (70 mmol sodium intake per day),&#xD;
      potassium chloride supplementation (normal diet plus 1 mmol/kg potassium chloride per day),&#xD;
      and placebo (normal diet plus placebo capsule). Capsules for the potassium chloride and&#xD;
      placebo groups were administered in a double blind protocol. Blood pressure was measured&#xD;
      every three months for three years. The effect of the intervention was determined by&#xD;
      comparing the rate of rise (slope) of blood pressure among the groups using a&#xD;
      random-coefficient growth curve model.&#xD;
