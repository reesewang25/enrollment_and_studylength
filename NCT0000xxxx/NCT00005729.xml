      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator originally applied for the grant in response to an NHLBI initiative on &quot;CVD&#xD;
      Nutrition Education for Low Literacy Skills&quot;. The initiative originated within the Prevention&#xD;
      and Demonstration Branch of the DECA, was approved by the September 1988 National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Advisory Council, and released in July 1990. However, the grant was not&#xD;
      awarded as part of the RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 1,800 students in 90 different classes were randomly assigned to the special&#xD;
      nutritional intervention or an attention-control condition where a certification course in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was taught. Specially trained ESL teachers actually led&#xD;
      the intervention classes, which were designed in accordance with the NHLBI and American Red&#xD;
      Cross guidelines, respectively. Specific educational content for the intervention group&#xD;
      included sources of dietary fat and cholesterol nutrients affecting blood pressure, basic&#xD;
      shopping skills, food preparation skills , and dealing with special occasions, i.e.,&#xD;
      potlucks. A booster session was held to monitor progress, provide reinforcement for success&#xD;
      or additional problem solving for difficulties, review materials, and plan maintenance.&#xD;
      Consistent with a Social Learning (Cognitive) Theory (SLT) framework, all sessions included&#xD;
      modeling*, role playing, corrective feedback and social reinforcement, homework, and&#xD;
      confidence building activities. With attention to the specific needs of this population which&#xD;
      was low in literacy (at least in English), the smallest amount of information necessary was&#xD;
      presented, each point was made as vividly as possible, participants restated and otherwise&#xD;
      demonstrated their mastery of the material, and frequent repetition was used. A substantial&#xD;
      period of formative research emphasized specific adaptations of existing material to make it&#xD;
      appropriate for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement occurred at baseline, at three months and at a six months follow-up. Measures&#xD;
      included blood pressure, total cholesterol, height/weight, waist and hip circumference,&#xD;
      24-hour dietary recall, SLT-based knowledge, attitude and behavior variables, the&#xD;
      Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) Life Skills Reading Test and Spanish&#xD;
      literacy through the Cloze technique. All self-report measurement except the CASAS was&#xD;
      conducted in English or Spanish, primarily through oral interview. SLT knowledge, attitude,&#xD;
      and behavioral measures of instructors in study and non-study classes were also assessed.&#xD;
