    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a synthetic hormone, CDB-2914, for&#xD;
      treating symptoms of menopause. It will compare the effects of estrogen and CDB-2914 with&#xD;
      those of estrogen and progesterone in postmenopausal women. The study will also evaluate&#xD;
      whether CDB-2914 affects adrenal gland function. CDB-2914 is chemically similar to cortisol,&#xD;
      a hormone that is produced by the adrenal glands and regulates the body's response to&#xD;
      stresses, such as infection or injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy women volunteers between the ages of 45 and 70 who have not had a menstrual period&#xD;
      for over a year, are not currently taking hormone replacement therapy, do not smoke and have&#xD;
      not had a hysterectomy may be eligible for this study. Candidates will provide a medical&#xD;
      history and have a physical examination, including a breast and pelvic exam. They will also&#xD;
      provide a blood sample, have a mammogram and pap smear, and be instructed in dietary sources&#xD;
      and/or supplements required to be sure they consume at least 1,000 mg. of calcium each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to take: a) estrogen plus CDB-2914, b) estrogen plus&#xD;
      progesterone, or c) estrogen plus a placebo (look-alike tablet with no active ingredient)&#xD;
      daily by mouth for 6 weeks. During the study period, they will keep a record of any symptoms,&#xD;
      vaginal bleeding, and other medicines they take. They will return to the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      weekly for blood tests and to fill out a questionnaire on mood, appetite, sleep patterns,&#xD;
      menopausal symptoms, and other quality of life issues. At the 6-week visit, participants&#xD;
      will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bring a 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a vaginal ultrasound to evaluate the effects of the medication on the thickness of&#xD;
           the endometrium (lining of the uterus)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bring all bottles of study medication for a pill count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss any unusual or troubling symptoms with the study nurse or physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final visit will be scheduled 1 to 3 weeks after the 6-week visit, when participants will&#xD;
      turn in their calendar of daily symptoms and return unused progesterone pills.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Doctors recommend hormone replacement therapy to postmenopausal women as treatment for&#xD;
      symptoms of estrogen-deficiency. However, many women do not take hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      because of side effects. In women with an intact uterus, estrogen must be given with&#xD;
      progesterone to prevent overgrowth of the lining of the uterus. Side effects from&#xD;
      progesterone may cause women to discontinue hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compounds that are similar to naturally occurring hormones have been synthesized and studied&#xD;
      for their ability to block or simulate the action of sex steroids such as estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone. The development of this class of compounds, called selective hormone receptor&#xD;
      modulators, may provide new treatments that are targeted to specific organs or tissues. One&#xD;
      example is the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene, which blocks estrogen action&#xD;
      at the uterus, and acts like estrogen at the bone. Raloxifene has been approved for use in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women as a form of hormone replacement therapy and a treatment for&#xD;
      osteoporosis. It provides many of estrogen's benefits without stimulating the uterine lining&#xD;
      and thus may be taken without a progestin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the selective progesterone receptor modulator CDB-2914, a man-made&#xD;
      hormone. Other progesterone receptor modulators have been shown to block estrogen's&#xD;
      stimulating effect on the uterus in monkeys. If CDB-2914 has this effect in menopausal women,&#xD;
      it may provide a new approach to hormone replacement therapy. In women studied at the NIH,&#xD;
      single doses of CDB-2914 slowed uterine development or induced menses, depending on when it&#xD;
      was given during the menstrual cycle. Like raloxifene, CDB-2914 has the potential for use in&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy, but to date the effects of its chronic administration have not&#xD;
      been studied. This study aims to evaluate the safety and the physiologic and endocrine&#xD;
      effects of chronic oral administration of CDB-2914 in postmenopausal women. All study&#xD;
      subjects will receive daily oral estrogen and either CDB-2914, progesterone or a placebo to&#xD;
      evaluate whether CDB-2914 blocks or enhances the usual effects of hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      on the uterine lining, lipid levels, clotting factors, bone turnover, hot flashes and quality&#xD;
      of life. Weekly blood measurements, quality of life questionnaires, pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations of the uterus and a single biopsy of the uterine lining will be&#xD;
      performed on all study subjects to assess these endpoints.&#xD;
