  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using extrinsic laryngeal muscle&#xD;
      stimulation to elevate the larynx in a manner similar to that which occurs during normal&#xD;
      swallowing. This research will also determine whether laryngeal elevation will open the upper&#xD;
      esophageal sphincter to assist with entry of the bolus into the esophagus. This protocol&#xD;
      includes studies in normal volunteers and patients with swallowing disorders. The outcome of&#xD;
      this study will be relevant to future use of neuromuscular stimulation for laryngeal&#xD;
      elevation in patients with pharyngeal dysphagia....&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if stimulation of the extrinsic laryngeal muscles will elevate the larynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if augmentation of laryngeal elevation using intra-muscular stimulation&#xD;
           will reduce the risk of aspiration in chronic pharyngeal dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether stimulation to induce laryngeal elevation assists with opening the&#xD;
           upper esophageal sphincter both at rest and during swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether laryngeal sensation is intact has bearing on the ability of&#xD;
           patients with chronic dysphagia to trigger the onset of stimulation in synchrony with&#xD;
           their own swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To contrast the effects of surface and intra-muscular stimulation on hyo-laryngeal&#xD;
           movement at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To contrast the benefits of surface and intra-muscular stimulation on the risk or&#xD;
           aspiration/penetration during swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Both normal volunteers and patients with severe chronic pharyngeal&#xD;
      dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Hooked wire electrodes and surface electrodes will be used to stimulate extrinsic&#xD;
      muscles either alone or in combination both at rest and during swallowing while using&#xD;
      videofluoroscopy to record hyo-laryngeal movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Kinematic analyses of hyo-laryngeal movements using image processing and&#xD;
      marking from video-recordings will quantify movement with stimulation, manometric pressure&#xD;
      recordings and cricopharyngeus electromyography will evaluate the effects of muscles&#xD;
      stimulation on the upper esophageal sphincter function and blinded ratings of the degree of&#xD;
      aspiration and penetration and clearance during swallowing will be conducted by&#xD;
      speech-language pathologists to compare the effects of intra-muscular and surface stimulation&#xD;
      on swallowing on risk of aspiration and penetration during swallowing.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR NORMAL VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The normal volunteers will be without cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, otolaryngological,&#xD;
        psychiatric or speech, swallowing and hearing problems as determined by medical history and&#xD;
        examination by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For volunteers undergoing either intra-muscular stimulation or submental surface&#xD;
        stiimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of Rheumatic fever, mitral valve prolapse, or cardiac arrhythmias as determined by&#xD;
        medical history, physical and EKG. A physician will auscultate for cardiac murmurs prior to&#xD;
        any study to exclude patients who might be at risk for endocarditis. Subjects will have an&#xD;
        EKG as part of the screening for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy will exclude women from participation because the study involves radiation&#xD;
        exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will also be excluded if they are taking psychiatric or neuroleptic medications&#xD;
        which would interfere with the interpretation of the neurophysiological studies or are&#xD;
        taking herbal medications that can affect coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a history of a psychiatric disorder, under the care of a psychiatrist, or on&#xD;
        medications for treatment of a psychiatric disorder will be excluded from study. Examples&#xD;
        of psychiatric disorders to be excluded are: somatoform disorders, conversion disorders,&#xD;
        current major depression, or a history of schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder. However, a&#xD;
        history of a previous episode of a minor reactive depression would not exclude a person&#xD;
        from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers who are pregnant, or have any active medical or psychiatric conditions&#xD;
        will not be included for submental surface stimulation, as these may be contraindications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For volunteers undergoing intra-muscular stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of allergies to lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be HIV negative. HIV testing for out of town participants may be done prior&#xD;
        to traveling to the NIH. This is required because there is no potential benefit for normal&#xD;
        volunteers from participation in the study. Because multiple needle insertions are required&#xD;
        and the hooked wire electrodes remain in place for 1-2 hours increasing a risk of&#xD;
        contamination, persons who are immuno-compromised would be put at undue risk with no&#xD;
        opportunity for benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        None of the normal volunteers will have a reduction in the range of vocal fold movement&#xD;
        during the nasoendoscopy that might suggest laryngeal paralysis or paresis, joint&#xD;
        abnormality or neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caution will be exercised in patients with suspected or diagnosed heart problems or&#xD;
        suspected or diagnosed with epilepsy at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PHARYNGEAL DYSPHAGIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No peripheral laryngeal nerve injury that results in a lack of glottic closure for&#xD;
        swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No peripheral nerve injury to the muscles that will be stimulated for hyo-laryngeal&#xD;
        elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No laryngeal trauma that results in a lack of glottic closure for swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intact cognition and hearing (30 dB HL in speech range); IQ no less than 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current dependence on alternate means of nutrition and hydration (PEG, PEJ, PPN/TPN);&#xD;
        however, minimal PO is not cause for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have stable vital signs before coming to the NIH for study. To determine if a patient has&#xD;
        stable vital signs prior to admission and a physician has provided approval for&#xD;
        participation, the following information will be required depending upon the location of&#xD;
        the patient prior to admission. For patients in a nursing home setting, vital signs will be&#xD;
        needed 3 days prior to admission and a written form signed by the physician releasing the&#xD;
        patient. For patients not in a nursing home a physician's letter of referral written in the&#xD;
        past year documenting that the patient is medically stable will be required and a telephone&#xD;
        contact with the family or others involved in the patient's care that the patient is stable&#xD;
        before coming to the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least 6 months post onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater than or equal to 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of pharyngeal dysphagia placing the patient at risk for aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants may have other health problems such as diabetes mellitus, arteriosclerotic&#xD;
        coronary vascular disease and a history of smoking. These will not be cause for automatic&#xD;
        exclusion, but will be examined on an individual basis by the otolaryngologist in&#xD;
        determining the potential risk and benefit to the individual participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will have restricted per oral intake. Prior history of tracheostomy or current&#xD;
        tracheostomy is not a cause for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of progressive neurodigestive disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of swallowing difficulties prior to most recent or previous CVA's.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dementia, obtundation, somnolence, and agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        More than 90 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A tracheostomy that fixes the laryngeal position interfering with the possibility of&#xD;
        elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Moderate to severe oral phase swallowing dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pharyngeal structural abnormalities on videofluoroscopy including mass and diverticulum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Esophageal motility not within normal range of function appropriate for the patient's age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient on a regular diet without difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A MMSE score less than or equal to 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are pregnant, have a cardiac demand pacemaker, dementia, exhibit non-stop&#xD;
        vocalization, significant reflux due to use of a feeding tube, or drug toxicity will not be&#xD;
        included for VitalStim, as these are contraindications for use of the device. Caution will&#xD;
        be exercised in selection of patients with suspected or diagnosed heart problems or&#xD;
        suspected or diagnosed with epilepsy at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
