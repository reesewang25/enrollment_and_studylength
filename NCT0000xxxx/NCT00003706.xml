      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Chemotherapy drugs may have different effects in patients with&#xD;
      different degrees of kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of LY231514 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and varying degrees of kidney function.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LY231514 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of renal&#xD;
      function. II. Determine the recommended dose for LY231514 in this patient population. III.&#xD;
      Examine the effects of renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of LY231514 in this patient&#xD;
      population. IV. Examine the relationship between impaired renal function, drug exposure, and&#xD;
      drug effects in these patients. V. Gather data for development of a LY231514 dosing nomogram&#xD;
      based on renal function. VI. Collect preliminary data regarding antitumor effects of LY231514&#xD;
      in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      renal function. Group 1 consists of patients with normal renal function, and groups 2, 3, and&#xD;
      4 consist of patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment. All patients receive&#xD;
      LY231514 IV over 10 minutes every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with escalating&#xD;
      doses of LY231514 within each treatment group. If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in&#xD;
      1 of 3 patients at a given dose level, then 3 additional patients are studied. The maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose level at which less than 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      DLT. Patients are followed until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
