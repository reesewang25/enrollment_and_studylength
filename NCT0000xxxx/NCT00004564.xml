  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if the action of the drug called clopidogrel,&#xD;
      that you will start taking, will be decreased by another drug called atorvastatin, that you&#xD;
      will also start taking. Clopidogrel is an oral antiplatelet agent that has been shown to&#xD;
      prevent strokes and heart attacks. Atorvastatin is a cholesterol lowering agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty adults 18-75 years of age requiring cholesterol-lowering agent and antiplatelet agent&#xD;
      therapy will be recruited for this study during their cardiology clinic visitation. In one&#xD;
      group, antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel) regimen will be administered first, then followed by&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering medication (atorvastatin). In the second group, atorvastatin will be&#xD;
      administered first, followed by clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new test called the erythromycin breath test will be administered to you three times during&#xD;
      the study to measure how your liver will metabolize these drugs. Blood samples will also be&#xD;
      obtained to assess platelet function. The criteria for exclusion are patient refusal or&#xD;
      inability to give written consent, patients with allergic reaction to erythromycin, patients&#xD;
      with known bleeding problems, liver disease, significant lung disease kidney disease and&#xD;
      pregnancy. Patients with psychiatric impairment and documented history of substance abuse&#xD;
      will also be excluded from the study.&#xD;
