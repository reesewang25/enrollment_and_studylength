  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers would like to learn more about the low levels of bone mineral&#xD;
      density seen in approximately half of women in their forties diagnosed as currently having or&#xD;
      previously had depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bones are always undergoing a process of building (formation) and breakdown (resorption).&#xD;
      This process is referred to as bone remodeling. When more bone is formed than resorbed, the&#xD;
      density (level of calcium) in bone increases and the bones become stronger. However, if more&#xD;
      bone is resorbed than formed the density of bone decreases and the bones become weak. This&#xD;
      condition is called osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown if women with depression have decreased bone mineral density as a result of too&#xD;
      much breakdown of bone or not enough building. It is important to know the cause of low bone&#xD;
      mineral density because it will influence the way a patient is treated. Medications like&#xD;
      bisphosphonates are used when there is too much bone breakdown. Growth hormone replacement&#xD;
      can be given in cases where there is not enough bone production. Presently, bone biopsy and a&#xD;
      procedure known as histomorphometry can determine what processes are going on in bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have decided to use a sample of bone (biopsy) from part of the hip bone (iliac&#xD;
      crest). In addition, researchers will collect a sample of bone marrow (the soft tissue found&#xD;
      in the center of bones) to tell them more about the biochemical, cellular, and molecular&#xD;
      processes that may be contributing to the problem of decreased bone density in depressed&#xD;
      premenopausal women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have recently found that premenopausal women with past or current depression show&#xD;
      clinically significant decrements in bone mineral density in the hip and spine, rendering&#xD;
      more than 40% at present risk for osteoporotic fracture. Recent pharmacologic advances&#xD;
      provide the opportunity to ameliorate or reverse this clinically significant loss of bone&#xD;
      mineral density. Available agents such as bisphosphonates or growth hormone are each&#xD;
      preferentially effective in the contexts of increased and decreased bone turnover,&#xD;
      respectively. It is currently not known whether the decrease in bone mineral density in&#xD;
      depression is associated with increased or decreased bone turnover because the many endocrine&#xD;
      changes associated with depression of possible relevance to decreased bone mineral density&#xD;
      have disparate effects on bone turnover dynamics. At present, the only definitive way to&#xD;
      determine the status of bone turnover in humans is via bone biopsy and histomorphometric&#xD;
      evaluation. In addition, bone marrow routinely obtained during standard bone biopsy would&#xD;
      provide the opportunity to culture osteoblast and osteoclast progenitor cells to determine&#xD;
      possible abnormalities in differentiation and function as a means of exploring the cellular&#xD;
      and molecular mechanisms of decreased bone mineral density in depression. In light of the&#xD;
      high incidence of depression in women, decreased bone mineral density in patients with past&#xD;
      or current depression has considerable public health implications.&#xD;

        Female patients with primary affective disorder (major depression n=17).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls must not have psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with past or current depression will be studied if bone mineral density in any&#xD;
        site in either hip or spine was assessed by DEXA scan to be equal to or greater than 1 1/2&#xD;
        standard deviation below peak bone density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with psychiatric illness can either be drug free or receiving any FDA approved&#xD;
        medication for the treatment of depression, with the exception of valproic acid and&#xD;
        carbamazepine, which are known to interfere with intestinal calcium absorption (and hence,&#xD;
        can influence bone mineral density), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which can interact&#xD;
        adversely with fentanyl in the event that it would be given for relief of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        During the course of the entire study all subjects must abstain from tobacco and alcohol&#xD;
        and will be instructed to inform the physicians conducting the research about their use of&#xD;
        prescription or non-prescription medication, including birth control pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have any serious medical illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have current or past, prolonged steroid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not be on anticoagulant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not be allergic to or have shown adverse reactions to tetracyline, benzodiazepines,&#xD;
        fentanyl, or lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have used aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in the past&#xD;
        week.&#xD;
