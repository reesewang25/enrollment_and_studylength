  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To obtain a pharmacokinetic profile of oral ZDV and to determine whether the oral&#xD;
      administration of Zidovudine (ZDV) during labor and delivery will provide a similar profile&#xD;
      to that obtained with the use of IV ZDV in ACTG 082. To evaluate the tolerance of oral ZDV in&#xD;
      this population, defined as the ability to take oral doses and lack of vomiting within 30&#xD;
      minutes of receiving oral study doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The worldwide use of constant intrapartum ZDV infusions to prevent transmission is not&#xD;
      practical or feasible. Approximately 18% of the women in the ACTG 076 trial missed their IV&#xD;
      ZDV infusions, even at experienced ACTG sites. There is an urgent need to establish a more&#xD;
      practical method of delivering ZDV during labor and delivery that, at minimum, will&#xD;
      approximate the rate of ZDV administration utilized in ACTG 082. In the future, this would&#xD;
      enable women to start an intensive ZDV regimen during early labor, even prior to reaching the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

      enable women to start an intensive ZDV regimen during early labor, even prior to reaching the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Women in active labor receive 3 doses of oral ZDV 3 hours apart followed by PK&#xD;
      sampling. After PK sampling post 3rd oral dose, or at 8 cm dilation (whichever comes first),&#xD;
      women receive IV ZDV until delivery. The cord blood will be analyzed for serum ZDV PK levels&#xD;
      and the infant's infection status will be determined. If the dose of ZDV is adequate to&#xD;
      achieve targeted maternal serum drug levels in Cohort 1 and if oral dosing is tolerated in&#xD;
      this cohort, Cohort 2 will begin enrollment. [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/03/01: Cohort 1 has been&#xD;
      completed and only Cohort 2 is open for enrollment.] Cohort 2: [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/03/01:&#xD;
      Women in active labor receive initial loading dose of oral ZDV, then another dose of oral ZDV&#xD;
      3 hours later, both doses followed by PK sampling. After PK sampling post second oral dose,&#xD;
      or at 8 cm dilation (whichever comes first), woman receives IV ZDV until delivery. The cord&#xD;
      blood will not be analyzed for serum ZDV PK levels and the infant's infection status will be&#xD;
      determined.]&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        A woman may be eligible for this study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She is HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She is at least 34 weeks pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She has a history of at least 4 weeks of continuous oral ZDV during her current&#xD;
             pregnancy and tolerated it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She has given consent for her newborn to participate in this study. (The father must&#xD;
             also give consent if he is available after reasonable attempts to contact him. A woman&#xD;
             under 18 needs the consent of a parent or legal guardian for her and her infant to&#xD;
             participate.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        A woman will not be eligible for this study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She is taking part in another study of HIV treatment during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Her infant has a life-threatening illness indicated in an ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Her infant does not appear to be growing normally in the womb.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She has a cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She has abnormal blood test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She has severe nausea, vomiting, or other problems of the stomach and intestines at&#xD;
             the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  She has an active opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection or other serious infection at&#xD;
             the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study staff cannot find a usable vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study doctor feels that she cannot take drugs by mouth.&#xD;
