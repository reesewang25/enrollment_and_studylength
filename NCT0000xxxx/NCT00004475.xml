  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish linkage in families with hereditary pancreatitis&#xD;
      (HP) to the cationic trypsinogen gene or other, as yet unknown, HP gene(s).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Pancreatitis (HP) is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas which is usually&#xD;
      recurrent in nature and occurs in blood-related persons over two or more generations. It is&#xD;
      an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance by variable expression. Symptoms are&#xD;
      usually present during childhood and it is the second most common cause of chronic or&#xD;
      recurrent pancreatitis in children. HP is a primary disorder and can therefore be&#xD;
      differentiated from other inherited disorders that cause secondary pancreatitis. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to establish linkage in families with HP between the phenotype and a&#xD;
      chromosomal locus (loci) which contains the responsible gene. Affected families are recruited&#xD;
      to donate a blood sample through referral from their primary physician or self-referral. The&#xD;
      potential significance lies in the identification of the genetic defect causing HP and&#xD;
      understanding the pathophysiologic mechanism of the disease. Typically families with HP have&#xD;
      a high incidence of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and identification of the cause of this&#xD;
      disease may provide critical insights into the cause of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected from patients and family members. DNA is extracted from the blood&#xD;
      and used for genotypic analysis and linkage analysis. Patients do not necessarily receive the&#xD;
      results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence the type or duration of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
