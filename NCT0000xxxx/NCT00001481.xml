      Determine whether postpartum depression is triggered by the abrupt withdrawal of estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appearance of mood and behavioral symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period has&#xD;
      been extensively reported. While there has been much speculation about possible biologically&#xD;
      based etiologies for postpartum disorders (PPD), none has ever been confirmed. Preliminary&#xD;
      results from two related studies (protocols 90-M-0088, 92-M-0174) provide evidence that women&#xD;
      with menstrual cycle related mood disorder, but not controls, experience mood disturbances&#xD;
      during exogenous replacement of physiologic levels of gonadal steroids. The present protocol&#xD;
      is designed to create a &quot;scaled-down&quot; hormonal milieu of pregnancy and the puerperium in&#xD;
      order to determine whether women who have had a previous episode of postpartum major&#xD;
      effective episode will experience differential mood and behavioral effects compared with&#xD;
      controls and to determine whether it is the abrupt withdrawal of gonadal steroids or the&#xD;
      prolonged exposure to gonadal steroids that is associated with mood symptoms.&#xD;
      Supraphysiologic plasma levels of gonadal steroids will be established, maintained, and then&#xD;
      rapidly reduced, simulating the hormonal events that occur during pregnancy and parturition.&#xD;
      This will be accomplished by administering estradiol and progesterone to women who are&#xD;
      pretreated with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (Lupron). After eight weeks,&#xD;
      administration of gonadal steroids will be stopped in one group of patients and controls, and&#xD;
      a sudden decline in the plasma hormone levels will be precipitated. Another group will be&#xD;
      maintained on supraphysiologic levels of estrogen and progesterone for an additional month.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will include mood, behavioral and hormonal parameters (a separate protocol&#xD;
      done in collaboration with NICHD).&#xD;
