      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells combined with melanoma antigens&#xD;
      may make the body build an immune response to tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a&#xD;
      person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Combining vaccine therapy with&#xD;
      interleukin-2 may be an effective treatment for stage III or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without&#xD;
      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be&#xD;
      surgically removed.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      autologous dendritic cells transduced with adenoviruses encoding the MART-1 and gp100&#xD;
      melanoma antigens with or without interleukin-2 in patients with stage III or IV melanoma.&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the cellular response and efficacy of these regimens in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are sequentially assigned to one of three&#xD;
      dose levels. Patients receive modified autologous dendritic cells subcutaneously on day 1&#xD;
      with or without interleukin-2 IV on days 4-19. Treatment continues every 21 days for a total&#xD;
      of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6&#xD;
      patients receive escalating doses of modified dendritic cells with or without interleukin-2&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each regimen is reached. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      dose below that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.&#xD;
