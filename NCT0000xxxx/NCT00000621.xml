      To conduct feasibility studies on the use of retinoids in the treatment of emphysema.&#xD;
      Specific objectives are to identify optimal patient populations, retinoids, doses, dosing&#xD;
      schedules, routes of administration, and outcome measures preparatory to conducting a larger,&#xD;
      controlled, clinical trial on the efficacy of retinoid therapy in the management of&#xD;
      emphysema.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and&#xD;
      emphysema, affects more than 16 million Americans, is the fourth leading cause of death in&#xD;
      the USA, and costs the nation billions in direct and indirect health care costs. Though only&#xD;
      about two million of the 16 million people with COPD have emphysema, emphysema is more&#xD;
      disabling, accounting for approximately half of the 114 million days of restricted activity&#xD;
      and half of the 53 million days of disability attributed to COPD per year. Emphysema is&#xD;
      characterized by destruction of the air space walls, leading anatomically to abnormal,&#xD;
      persistent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, and without&#xD;
      obvious fibrosis. The clinical result is continuous dyspnea due to hyperinflation of the&#xD;
      lung, over distention of the chest wall, disadvantaged respiratory muscles, and hypoxia, even&#xD;
      at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options in emphysema are limited and primarily aimed at symptomatic relief of the&#xD;
      dyspnea by maximizing the depleted reserves of the patient. In the late stages, care is&#xD;
      supportive, in the form of oxygen therapy, bronchodilator, nutritional supplementation and&#xD;
      exercise rehabilitation. Exercise rehabilitation has been shown to improve the quality of&#xD;
      life, but only oxygen therapy has been shown to affect survival. For patients less than 60&#xD;
      years old, lung transplantation may be possible, but scarcity of donor lungs and expense&#xD;
      greatly limits this option and the efficacy has not been studied. Lung volume reduction&#xD;
      surgery is currently under investigation for its effect on symptoms and survival. For the few&#xD;
      patients with hereditary alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, the recent report of the NHLBI&#xD;
      supported Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Registry Study Group cautions that although those&#xD;
      with moderate airflow obstruction may benefit from augmentation therapy, more studies were&#xD;
      needed to draw firm conclusions and to answer questions about dose and dosing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent laboratory data have shown that all-trans-retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A,&#xD;
      can regenerate alveoli in adult rats with elastase induced emphysema (Massaro, GD and Massaro&#xD;
      D. Retinoic Acid Treatment Abrogates Elastase-induced Pulmonary Emphysema in Rats. Nature Med&#xD;
      3:675-677, 1997). Based upon the findings that prior to septation, rats have fibroblasts rich&#xD;
      in vitamin A storage granules, high concentrations of cellular retinol binding protein, and&#xD;
      lung nuclear retinoic acid binding receptors, all of which diminish after septation and the&#xD;
      fact that retinoic acid increases the number of alveoli in rats, the investigators reasoned&#xD;
      that retinoic acid plays a key role in septation. Tracheal instillation of elastase into&#xD;
      adult rats resulted in an increase in lung volume, a decrease in surface area, and large&#xD;
      alveoli as in human emphysema. Intra peritoneal injection of all-trans retinoic acid in the&#xD;
      elastase-treated rats for 12 days prior to sacrifice reduced the lung volume and increased&#xD;
      the surface area to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the elastase-treated rats, all trans-retinoic acid has been found to induce&#xD;
      formation of alveoli in normal rats, in neonatal rats treated with dexamethasone, which&#xD;
      prevents septation, in adult tight skin mice, and in fetal mouse lung in culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings led to interest in the medical community whether adult emphysema patients&#xD;
      might get symptomatic relief from treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid. In September 1998,&#xD;
      the NHLBI convened a workshop, entitled &quot;Clinical Trial Feasibility: All-trans-Retinoic Acid&#xD;
      for the Treatment of Emphysema&quot;, to discuss the feasibility of a clinical trial to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of retinoic acid in the treatment of emphysema. The workshop participants agreed&#xD;
      that the laboratory findings were exciting, but that a proof of principle study was needed to&#xD;
      demonstrate whether the laboratory findings could be applied to humans with emphysema. Since&#xD;
      there was adequate information about the dose range and toxicity of retinoids in humans,&#xD;
      adequate methods for assessing the extent of emphysema, and adequate methods to assess the&#xD;
      biological activity and distribution of retinoids in the human lung, the workshop&#xD;
      participants thought studies in emphysema patients were possible and appropriate. Several&#xD;
      possible populations and retinoids, especially the retinoic acids, were discussed as&#xD;
      appropriate for a clinical trial. However, the participants did not think that there was&#xD;
      sufficient information available to recommend a single trial design and recommended the&#xD;
      conduct of multiple small trials, allowing flexibility in the choice of population, retinoid,&#xD;
      doses, and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core study is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial enrolling a total of 300 non-smoking persons with emphysema at 5 participating clinical&#xD;
      centers. Study participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three retinoid&#xD;
      treatment arms. Within each study arm, participants were randomized to active treatment or to&#xD;
      a matched placebo in a 3:1 ratio. After six months of follow-up, the three month crossover&#xD;
      period began. Participants initially assigned to active treatment began taking the matched&#xD;
      placebo, and participants originally assigned placebo began taking the active treatment.&#xD;
      Retinoid treatment arms were all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA trademark, Roche Laboratories,&#xD;
      Inc.) at two different doses and 13-cis retinoic acid (cRA, Roche Laboratories, Inc.), each&#xD;
      with matched placebo. Several single-center substudies were also performed.&#xD;
