      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of ovarian cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#xD;
      arzoxifene hydrochloride may fight ovarian or peritoneal cancer by blocking the use of&#xD;
      estrogen by the tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well arzoxifene hydrochloride works in treating&#xD;
      women with metastatic refractory ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate response rate to arzoxifene hydrochloride in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      refractory ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the time to&#xD;
      progressive disease, time to treatment failure, response duration, and survival of these&#xD;
      patients. III. Assess the safety of this treatment in these patients. IV. Measure changes in&#xD;
      serum estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone binding&#xD;
      globulin during this treatment in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral arzoxifene hydrochloride daily at a fixed dose. Treatment&#xD;
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor. NCI did not&#xD;
      update the record when the trial completed. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to&#xD;
      Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record with the trial completion&#xD;
      date. This trial is not an applicable trial under Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act&#xD;
      of 2007 (FDAAA).&#xD;
