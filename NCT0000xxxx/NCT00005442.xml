      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this investigation helped to shed substantial light on the controversial&#xD;
      relationship between triglycerides and coronary heart disease, a topic of great importance to&#xD;
      preventive cardiology. Additionally, important methodological information was obtained in the&#xD;
      study of interactions and precision of variables in epidemiologic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were three components to the study: 1) an analysis of several existing cardiovascular&#xD;
      databases for evidence of a significant association between coronary heart disease and&#xD;
      specific lipid interactions involving triglycerides; 2) an analysis of these databases to&#xD;
      investigate the role of measurement precision on the association between elevated&#xD;
      triglyceride levels and coronary heart disease; and 3) a survey of both expert lipidologists&#xD;
      and community clinicians to examine current practices related to screening for and treatment&#xD;
      of elevated triglyceride levels for the purpose of reducing coronary heart disease risk. Five&#xD;
      databases were used in the first two components of this study. These data sets included those&#xD;
      of the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence and Mortality Follow-up Studies; the Lipid Research&#xD;
      Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial; the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial; the&#xD;
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Type II Coronary Intervention Study; and the Coronary Drug&#xD;
      Project. For the first component, detailed statistical analyses of all databases were&#xD;
      performed, specifically examining the role of lipid interactions involving triglycerides and&#xD;
      their association with coronary heart disease. For the second component, more precise&#xD;
      estimates of each subject's lipid levels were recalculated using the multiple lipid&#xD;
      measurements already available in each database. Each dataset was then analyzed for evidence&#xD;
      of an independent relationship between triglycerides and coronary heart disease and to&#xD;
      validate the theoretical findings suggesting that measurement imprecision may explain the&#xD;
      difficulty of detecting an independent triglyceride-coronary heart disease association. The&#xD;
      public health implications of the current state of knowledge surrounding triglycerides were&#xD;
      assessed with survey research techniques in the third component.&#xD;
