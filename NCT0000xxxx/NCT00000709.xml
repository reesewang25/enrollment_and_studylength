  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide accurate and complete neurologic assessment of the course of the AIDS dementia&#xD;
      complex in patients treated with zidovudine (AZT). The study will determine how frequently&#xD;
      patients improve, how long improvement is sustained, and the magnitude and functional&#xD;
      significance of improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with AIDS frequently suffer central nervous system (CNS) problems that are&#xD;
      characterized by cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits, in a disorder known as AIDS&#xD;
      dementia complex. Clinical experience suggests that its course is often progressive, going&#xD;
      from initial symptoms to moderate or severe dementia within several months. Accumulating&#xD;
      evidence now suggests that direct brain infection by the HIV virus is the likely cause of the&#xD;
      AIDS dementia complex. Case reports suggest that therapy with AZT, which has been shown to be&#xD;
      a strong inhibitor of HIV replication in vitro, may alleviate the AIDS dementia complex. This&#xD;
      study will help define the natural history of the AIDS dementia complex in treated patients.&#xD;

      dementia complex. Clinical experience suggests that its course is often progressive, going&#xD;

      study will help define the natural history of the AIDS dementia complex in treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive AZT for 24 weeks. Patients are seen weekly for the first 4 weeks, every&#xD;
      other week for the next 8 weeks, and then every 4 weeks until the completion of the study for&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluation. This evaluation includes lumbar puncture, and either&#xD;
      computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
