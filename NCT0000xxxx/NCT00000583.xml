      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although most carriers of HBsAg are asymptomatic, a substantial proportion eventually develop&#xD;
      chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. There is also overwhelming evidence that the&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus is the single most important causative factor of hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
      Thus, mass immunization programs against HBV infection may ultimately affect not only the&#xD;
      incidence of acute hepatitis B and the pool of chronic carriers but may also reduce the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Krugman and his co-workers laid the groundwork for active immunization against hepatitis B in&#xD;
      1970 to 1973. They discovered that a 1:10 dilution of hepatitis B infective serum lost its&#xD;
      infectivity when boiled for one minute but retained its antigenicity and prevented hepatitis&#xD;
      B in 70 percent of vaccinated subjects. Hilleman and his colleagues at the Merck Institute of&#xD;
      Therapeutic Research developed a more sophisticated vaccine consisting of highly purified,&#xD;
      formalin-inactivated HBsAg particles derived from the plasma of chronic carriers of the&#xD;
      antigen. By 1978, data were sufficient to permit testing in a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first subject was inoculated in November 1978, and by October 1979, recruitment had&#xD;
      ended. In May 1980, all trial events were reviewed and classified by an expert panel. In June&#xD;
      1980 the code of vaccine and placebo allocation was broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double blind, fixed-sample. A total of 549 subjects were allocated to the vaccine&#xD;
      group in which they were treated with highly purified formalin-inactivated virus subunits&#xD;
      derived from the plasma of chronic carriers of hepatitis B. A total of 534 were allocated to&#xD;
      the placebo group. Both groups received injections at 0, 1 month, and 6 months unless&#xD;
      evidence of infection developed before the series was completed.&#xD;
