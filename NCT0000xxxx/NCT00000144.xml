  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) has often been used instead of&#xD;
      surgery as the treatment of choice in cases of open-angle glaucoma that could not be&#xD;
      controlled by drugs. ALT treatment consists of tiny laser burns evenly spaced around the&#xD;
      trabecular meshwork. It sometimes has been found to be effective in controlling glaucoma,&#xD;
      although many eyes still require some medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT), a randomized, controlled clinical trial, was conducted to&#xD;
      determine whether ALT is effective in patients with newly diagnosed, primary, open-angle&#xD;
      glaucoma. Each of the 271 patients in the trial received argon laser treatment in one eye and&#xD;
      standard topical medication in the other eye. The eye to be started on medicine and the eye&#xD;
      that would get the laser treatment were randomly selected. The Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup&#xD;
      Study was a followup study of 203 of the 271 patients who enrolled in the Glaucoma Laser&#xD;
      Trial. By the close of the Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup Study, median duration of followup&#xD;
      since diagnosis of primary, open-angle glaucoma was 7 years (maximum, 9 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The argon laser treatment was done in two sessions 1 month apart, with one-half of the&#xD;
      trabecular meshwork treated with 45 to 55 laser burns in each session. Patients were seen for&#xD;
      a followup visit 3 months after the first laser treatment and every 3 months thereafter for a&#xD;
      period of at least 2 years. At each visit, examination of the eyes included a check of&#xD;
      intraocular pressure and visual acuity. Visual field examinations were performed 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months after randomization and annually thereafter. Disc stereo photographs were taken 6 and&#xD;
      12 months after randomization and annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of these examinations determined whether treatment should be changed. If the&#xD;
      pressure in either eye had not been reduced to the desired level, the physician changed the&#xD;
      medication in the eye treated with drops or started the use of drops in the laser-treated eye&#xD;
      according to a standardized procedure being used in the trial. If intraocular pressure was&#xD;
      still not successfully reduced, surgery or further laser treatment may have been required.&#xD;
