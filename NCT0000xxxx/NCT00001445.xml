      This is a single dose, phase I study to evaluate the safety/tolerance and the immunogenicity&#xD;
      of HIV-1 Immunogen, gp120-depleted inactivated HIV-1 preparation in Incomplete Freund's&#xD;
      Adjuvant (IFA), in children with HIV-1 infection. A total of 32 children with HIV-1 infection&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. Arm A of the study will enroll children who have no or&#xD;
      moderate immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by CDC classification and&#xD;
      who have no history of and do not require antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      given for less than 7 weeks (up to 6 weeks and 6 days) prior to entry will be considered as&#xD;
      &quot;no history&quot; of treatment (treatment naive). Arm B will enroll children who have no or&#xD;
      moderate immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by CDC classification and&#xD;
      who are on or have received antiretroviral treatment for more than 7 weeks. In order to&#xD;
      assess the age-associated impact on the immune response rate, we plan to continue to attempt&#xD;
      to enroll infants younger than 24 months of age. Children in each arm will receive 10 units&#xD;
      of HIV-1 Immunogen intramuscularly at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiretroviral treatment will commence once patients meet the criteria for an initiation of&#xD;
      the treatment as defined in the protocol. All antiretroviral agents that are currently&#xD;
      approved by FDA for clinical indications in HIV-1-infected children (pediatric labeling) are&#xD;
      permitted in the protocol. If the child has been receiving a single agent other than ddI, or&#xD;
      has been on investigational antiretroviral agents, his/her antiretroviral therapy will have&#xD;
      to be changed to an optimal combination regimen of the approved agents at least 6 weeks prior&#xD;
      to the enrollment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Children between the ages of 3 months and 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of HIV-1 infection as defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&#xD;
        Definition. Children and adolescents with vertically, transfusion or sexually acquired&#xD;
        HIV-1 infection are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Availability of a parent or guardian to provide Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ARM A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children and adolescents with vertically, transfusion or sexually acquired HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No or moderate immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by the CDC&#xD;
        Classification System, Immune Categories 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of or indication for antiretroviral intervention at time of enrollment or not&#xD;
        receiving antiretroviral treatment because: (a) the patient has elected to decline&#xD;
        treatment or (b) in the opinion of the patient's health care provider, antiretroviral&#xD;
        treatment is not currently recommended because of the patient's inability to adhere to&#xD;
        therapy, promoting the development of viral resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children younger than 24 months of age must not have had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels greater&#xD;
        than 8 X 10(4) copies/ml previously and at the time of initial evaluation, confirmed at&#xD;
        least at two different time points 2 to 4 weeks apart, showing no sign of increase&#xD;
        (increment less than 0.5 log(10). If the child has had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels greater than&#xD;
        8 X 10(4) copies/ml at some point prior to the initial evaluation, he/she will have to be&#xD;
        placed on antiretroviral treatment and must meet all the criteria for Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ARM B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children and adolescents with vertically, transfusion, or sexually acquired HIV-1&#xD;
        infection, who are on or have received antiretroviral treatment of longer than 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No or moderate immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by CDC&#xD;
        Classification System, Immune Categories 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children younger than 24 months or age, who meet all the inclusion criteria for army B must&#xD;
        have plasma HIV-1 RNA levels less than 5 X 10(4) copies/ml while receiving optimal&#xD;
        antiretroviral therapy, confirmed at least two different time points 2 to 4 weeks apart,&#xD;
        showing no sign of increase (increment less than 0.5 log(10). If the child has been&#xD;
        previously treated with antiretroviral drugs for more than 7 weeks (therefore not eligible&#xD;
        for arm A) and is currently off drugs, he/she will have to be placed on optimal&#xD;
        antiretroviral agents and will have to maintain viral RNA levels below 5 X 10(4) copies/ml&#xD;
        prior to the entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each child enrolled in arm B has to be on constant regimen of antiretroviral treatment for&#xD;
        at least 6 weeks-prior to the first inoculation. Children in immune categories 1 and 2 at&#xD;
        the time of study entry will be allowed to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not critically ill or clinically unstable or no presence of active infection requiring&#xD;
        on-going (or induction) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No evidence of severe immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by CDC&#xD;
        classification system, Immune Category 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For children younger than 24 months of age, no plasma HIV-1 RNA levels greater than or&#xD;
        equal to 5 x 10(4) copies/ml despite appropriate antiretroviral treatment, confirmed at&#xD;
        least at two different time points 2 to 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No use of tube feeding or intravenous hyperalimentation itself will be allowed as long as&#xD;
        it is a stable regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No administration of chemotherapeutic agents, or use of immunomodulating agents such as&#xD;
        corticosteroids, interferons, G-CSF, EPO, growth hormone (GH) or IVIG within one month of&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No abnormalities of laboratory findings within one month of enrollment including the&#xD;
        following: SGPT or SGOT greater than 5 times the normal value; Total bilirubin greater than&#xD;
        3 times normal; BUN or creatinine greater than 2 times normal; Total WBC greater than&#xD;
        150/mm(3) or ANC greater than 750/mm(3); Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dl (transfusions are&#xD;
        allowed); Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not pregnant or not planning to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No active substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able to comply with the study requirements for scheduled evaluations such as periodic&#xD;
        clinic visits or blood sampling.&#xD;
