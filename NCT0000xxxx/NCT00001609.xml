  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to discover the genes responsible for the development of&#xD;
      hereditary cataracts in families. A cataract is clouding of the lens of the eye that&#xD;
      obstructs the passage of light and may impair vision. Information from this study may provide&#xD;
      a better understanding of why hereditary cataracts form and perhaps lead to the development&#xD;
      of a test that can predict who will likely be affected and to what degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients or family members of patients with inherited cataracts who participate in this study&#xD;
      will be asked questions about their family history, especially concerning eye disease or&#xD;
      cataracts, and a family tree will be drawn. They will undergo a complete eye examination,&#xD;
      including photographs to document the clarity or opacity of the lens. In addition, a small&#xD;
      blood sample will be drawn for use in gene mapping studies of inherited cataract.&#xD;

      Although the etiology of some secondary cataracts is becoming better understood and certain&#xD;
      animal models have the promise to elucidate the relationships between lens crystallin and&#xD;
      hereditary cataract, little is known about the causes of congenital cataracts in humans. Even&#xD;
      the classification of different types of cataracts is cumbersome and imperfect. A better&#xD;
      understanding of cataractogenesis will come through an understanding of the molecular&#xD;
      components of the lens of the eye and the ways in which lesions of these components are&#xD;
      manifested structurally and functionally as opacity of the lens. It is well known that&#xD;
      cataracts exhibit marked genetic heterogeneity. In mice and humans, hereditary cataracts have&#xD;
      been shown to result from lesions at many distinct loci and those cataracts corresponding to&#xD;
      one locus can be morphologically heterogeneous, implying that environmental factors may&#xD;
      modify the phenotype of the cataract which a molecular lesion causes. Nonetheless, molecular&#xD;
      biological characterization of cataracts in the mouse and guinea pig has suggested that&#xD;
      alterations in lens crystallins can cause hereditary cataracts making them reasonable&#xD;
      candidate genes for causing hereditary cataracts in humans. In addition, it is apparent that&#xD;
      hereditary lesions which mimic or contribute additively to environmental stresses known to&#xD;
      cause cataracts might be candidate genes for causing hereditary cataracts. This knowledge&#xD;
      increases the feasibility of genetic linkage studies and provides a rationale basis on which&#xD;
      to begin the molecular analysis of naturally occurring hereditary cataracts. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      the purpose of this protocol to concentrate upon hereditary cataracts.&#xD;
