    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who have&#xD;
      previously treated, locally advanced, or metastatic cancer of the urothelium. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to&#xD;
      them without harming normal cells.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with trastuzumab&#xD;
      (Herceptin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine overall and&#xD;
      progression-free survival of this patient population treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a loading dose of trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of&#xD;
      week 1. For all subsequent doses, patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes weekly.&#xD;
      Treatment may continue for more than 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
