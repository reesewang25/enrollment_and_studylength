  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study provides a mechanism for evaluating patients for possible participation in NIDCR&#xD;
      clinical research studies. NIDCR studies involve three major areas-pain, neurosensory&#xD;
      mechanisms, and pain-relieving drugs-all of which have specific requirements and patient&#xD;
      characteristics. No treatment is offered under this protocol; it is intended to facilitate&#xD;
      patient recruitment into NIDCR studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unusual or unknown conditions that have or have not been diagnosed may be&#xD;
      eligible for this screening study. Specific medical criteria for enrollment vary with the&#xD;
      particular protocol for which the individual is being screened. Medical and dental histories&#xD;
      will be obtained and participants will have a dental examination. Diagnostic procedures will&#xD;
      be done in accord with standard medical and dental practice and may include X-rays, blood&#xD;
      tests, and routine urinalysis, as appropriate. Participants found eligible for an active&#xD;
      study may enroll in that study. Those who are not eligible for a current study may be&#xD;
      re-evaluated for future studies within a year if they wish. After 1 year, participants for&#xD;
      whom no appropriate studies are identified will be referred back to their primary doctor or&#xD;
      referring physician or dentist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to screen individuals with either third molars (&quot;wisdom teeth&quot;) in&#xD;
      need of removal, or with chronic orofacial pain as potential research subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual will be thoroughly evaluated during the screening process, including past&#xD;
      medical history and an appropriate physical examination. Other routine diagnostic procedures&#xD;
      and tests may also be completed in order to help determine a subject's eligibility. These&#xD;
      tests and procedures are of minimal risks and will be described in more detail in section&#xD;
      III: &quot;Study Procedures&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the screening process is completed and eligibility determined, the subjects will be&#xD;
      informed of their options to participate in one or more of the current NIDCR research&#xD;
      studies. If no appropriate protocol is identified, recommendations for other treatment&#xD;
      options may be given to the individual, their primary doctor, or referring physician/dentist.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Varies with the particular protocol for which a patient is being screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with unusual or unknown conditions that require the establishment of a diagnosis,&#xD;
        or those with an established diagnosis may be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects source for this study will be from referrals by medical and dental practitioners&#xD;
        in the private sector, clinics, hospitals, dental-medical institutions, Commissioned&#xD;
        Officers Dental Clinic, and the Occupational Medical Services at the National Institutes of&#xD;
