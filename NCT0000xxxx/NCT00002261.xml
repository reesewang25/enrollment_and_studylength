  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the physiological and immunological responses in healthy HIV seronegative adult&#xD;
      volunteers vaccinated with a) the HIVAC-1e (vaccinia-HIV) vaccine expressing the envelope&#xD;
      glycoproteins of HIV and b) the Wyeth smallpox vaccine. The parameters to be studied will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The course of physiological responses to vaccination, including (a) lesion development,&#xD;
           progression, and resolution; (b) physiological changes such as temperature, malaise,&#xD;
           itching at the site, etc. and (c) any observable AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The appearance, identity, quantity, and duration of humoral antibodies against HIV and&#xD;
           vaccinia virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The appearance, identity, quantity, and duration of cell-mediated immunity against HIV&#xD;
           and vaccinia virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The adequacy of a procedure using a special dressing to contain viral shedding from the&#xD;
           vaccination site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The safety, humoral and cellular immune responses of a booster injection of the&#xD;
           recombinant subunit gp160 vaccine (MicroGeneSys) in HIVAC-1e recipients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All drugs, medications, and therapy which, by virtue of direct pharmacologic action or&#xD;
             possible drug interaction, could influence the intended effects of the study vaccine&#xD;
             or mask its side effects may be concomitantly administered only by prescription by the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator and must be documented on the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any drug, even aspirin, which is administered after vaccination and during the follow&#xD;
             up periods must be documented on the patient's CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to meet any criteria listed under Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Development of active eczema or other skin condition which would increase the risk of&#xD;
             secondary vaccinia lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appearance of serologic or clinical evidence of HIV infection prior to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence of clinically active viral infections such as Mononucleosis,&#xD;
             Epstein-Barr Virus, or cytomegalovirus which may affect immunocompetence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active and overt parasitic, mycobacterial, or pyogenic infections that affect tests&#xD;
             designated in Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All drugs, medications and therapy not prescribed by the Principal Investigator, and&#xD;
             not documented on the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any drug, even aspirin, which is administered after vaccination and during the follow&#xD;
             up periods which is not documented on the patient's CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to meet any criteria listed under Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appearance of serologic or clinical evidence of HIV infection prior to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence of clinically active viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active and overt parasitic, mycobacterial, or pyogenic infections that affect tests&#xD;
             designated in Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk Behavior:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who do not agree to behave sexually in a manner that will minimize the risk of HIV&#xD;
        infection for the duration of the study are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be HIV seronegative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have excellent general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be unable to bear children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have no immediate household contacts, sex partners, intimate contacts.&#xD;

             inclusion criteria. They may be recruited from low risk behavior populations; from&#xD;
             laboratory and hospital employees providing service to the study who would normally&#xD;
             require Smallpox vaccination; and may be heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must agree to behave sexually in a manner that will minimize the risk of HIV&#xD;
        infection for the duration of the study.&#xD;
