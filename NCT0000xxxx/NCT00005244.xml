      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continued number of observations relating the Type A behavior pattern to coronary heart&#xD;
      disease underscores the importance of developing a careful theoretical basis that may account&#xD;
      for the virulent components of a coronary-prone personality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARDIA or Coronary Heart Disease Risk Development in Young Adults is a prospective,&#xD;
      epidemiological study of coronary heart disease risk factors in cohorts of Black and white&#xD;
      men and women, 18 to 30 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each of the baseline tape-recorded Type A/B structured interviews administered in&#xD;
      CARDIA, eighteen questions were scored for self-references, perceived pressure, anger&#xD;
      experience, and anger expression. The anger measures were related to other measures of&#xD;
      anger-in and hostility in order to establish their validity. The interrelationships of these&#xD;
      factors were assessed separately for each of the socioeconomic status (SES) categories. A&#xD;
      major focus of the analyses was to describe SES differences in how pressure was perceived and&#xD;
      how anger was experienced and expressed. The study also assessed how these factors were&#xD;
      related to data already collected on psychosocial risk factors and primary risk factors&#xD;
      including blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and cigarette smoking.&#xD;
