      AMENDED: 04-12-91 Population of patients changed FROM those who are intolerant of systemic&#xD;
      therapy with NON-sight-threatening CMV retinitis TO those AIDS patients intolerant of&#xD;
      systemic therapy with CMV retinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: 8/8/90. Changes made in neutrophils count from &lt; 500 to &lt; 750 cells/mm3.&#xD;
      Nonrandomized eyes will not be used for the primary efficacy evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIGINAL DESIGN: To determine the effectiveness and safety of ganciclovir (DHPG) therapy in&#xD;
      AIDS patients suffering from active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the retina of the eye&#xD;
      (retinitis) when the drug is administered directly into the fluid-filled vitreous cavity of&#xD;
      the eye by injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV retinitis is the most frequently seen opportunistic infection of the eye in AIDS&#xD;
      patients, and left untreated can lead to severe visual loss and blindness. While systemic&#xD;
      administration of DHPG has been shown to be an effective treatment for CMV retinitis, the&#xD;
      chronic administration required may be complicated by decreased blood cell counts&#xD;
      (granulocytopenia) which may require discontinuation of treatment. While withholding&#xD;
      treatment may allow recovery from the granulocytopenia, interruption of therapy may result in&#xD;
      reactivation of the retinitis. Injection of DHPG into the vitreous cavity of the eye may be&#xD;
      of benefit to severely neutropenic patients with CMV retinitis.&#xD;

      CMV retinitis is the most frequently seen opportunistic infection of the eye in AIDS&#xD;
      patients, and left untreated can lead to severe visual loss and blindness. While systemic&#xD;
      administration of DHPG has been shown to be an effective treatment for CMV retinitis, the&#xD;
      chronic administration required may be complicated by decreased blood cell counts&#xD;
      (granulocytopenia) which may require discontinuation of treatment. While withholding&#xD;
      treatment may allow recovery from the granulocytopenia, interruption of therapy may result in&#xD;
      reactivation of the retinitis. Injection of DHPG into the vitreous cavity of the eye may be&#xD;
      of benefit to severely neutropenic patients with CMV retinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have active CMV retinitis in one or both eyes, despite prior systemic therapy.&#xD;
      Following medical evaluation, the decision is made whether to treat the eye(s) immediately or&#xD;
      to watch the eye(s) carefully for advancement of the retinitis. Eyes with sight-threatening&#xD;
      lesions or eyes without functional vision are treated immediately and eyes without&#xD;
      sight-threatening lesions are randomly chosen for either immediate or deferred therapy. DHPG&#xD;
      is given by injection with a very fine needle twice a week for the first 3 weeks and once a&#xD;
      week for the remaining 24 weeks.&#xD;
