  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of the drugs Gemcitabine and Herceptin,&#xD;
      given in conjunction with radiation therapy, for treating patients with cancer of the&#xD;
      pancreas. Gemcitabine is standard therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. It damages tumor&#xD;
      cells and may enhance the effects of radiation therapy. Herceptin is a genetically engineered&#xD;
      antibody that has prevented some tumors from growing in patients with breast cancer. Because&#xD;
      breast and pancreatic cancer cells share an characteristic related to how Herceptin works&#xD;
      (similar HER-2/neu receptor proteins), it is thought that this drug may also inhibit growth&#xD;
      of tumors of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pancreatic cancer may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a physical examination, chest X-ray, blood tests, electrocardiogram, and computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. They will also have a minor surgical&#xD;
      procedure called a laparoscopy to evaluate the extent of their cancer. This procedure, done&#xD;
      under general anesthesia, requires an overnight hospital stay. A small incision (about 1&#xD;
      inch) is made in the abdomen and a thin, flexible tube with a light and special fibers at the&#xD;
      end is inserted into the opening. This device, called a laparoscope, allows the surgeon to&#xD;
      see inside the abdominal cavity to evaluate the tumor and also to remove a small piece of&#xD;
      tumor tissue for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients accepted into the study will be assigned to one of two treatment groups, according&#xD;
      to whether or not their tumor can be removed with surgery. Patients will be asked to complete&#xD;
      a Quality of Life Evaluation before treatment begins and again at each follow-up visit. This&#xD;
      15-minute questionnaire assesses patients' feelings, their ability to carry out usual&#xD;
      activities, and the effects of therapy on their general health and well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both treatment groups will be given the same chemotherapy, on an outpatient basis&#xD;
      unless special circumstances require hospitalization. Gemcitabine is infused over 30 to 60&#xD;
      minutes through an intravenous catheter (IV)-a thin plastic tube inserted into an arm vein.&#xD;
      Herceptin is then given over 30 to 90 minutes through the same IV line. Radiation therapy to&#xD;
      the abdomen will start the same day, after the drugs have been administered, and will&#xD;
      continue for the next 4 days. This treatment cycle-chemotherapy plus 5 days of radiation&#xD;
      therapy-will be repeated each week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 6 weeks after the last treatment, the patient's tumor will be evaluated with a blood&#xD;
      test and CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to determine if it can be removed with&#xD;
      surgery. If so, the procedure will be done under general anesthesia and will require a 7- to&#xD;
      10-day hospital stay. If the tumor cannot be removed with surgery, another biopsy will be&#xD;
      taken to evaluate the tumor's response to the chemotherapy and radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive additional chemotherapy beginning 6 weeks after surgery (for&#xD;
      patients whose tumors were removed) or 6 weeks after radiation therapy (for patients whose&#xD;
      tumors could not be removed). Gemcitabine and Herceptin will be given IV once a week for 3&#xD;
      weeks followed by a week of rest. This 4-week treatment cycle will be repeated up to six&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment ends, patients will be evaluated with CT scans or X-rays and blood tests&#xD;
      every 3 to 4 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter to evaluate disease&#xD;
      status.&#xD;

      This is a phase II study of gemcitabine and Herceptin given weekly as a bolus infusion&#xD;
      administered concurrently with radiotherapy in patients with regionally confined resectable&#xD;
      or unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that overexpress HER2. Patients will be&#xD;
      treated with external beam radiation in a standard manner over 6 weeks prior to surgical&#xD;
      exploration. Gemcitabine and Herceptin will be administered on the first day of irradiation&#xD;
      and weekly during the course of radiotherapy. Patients will be assessed for resectability&#xD;
      after treatment and may undergo a pancreatic resection. Patients will then be treated with&#xD;
      once weekly gemcitabine and herceptin for three weeks followed by 1 week of rest for up to 6&#xD;
      months. Patients will be assessed clinically for toxicity, tumor response, progression-free&#xD;
      survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
