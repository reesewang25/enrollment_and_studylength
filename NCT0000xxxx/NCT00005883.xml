      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the&#xD;
      development or recurrence of cancer. Phenethyl isothiocyanate may be effective in preventing&#xD;
      lung cancer in smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial of phenethyl isothiocyanate in preventing lung cancer in people who&#xD;
      smoke.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral phenethyl isothiocyanate in&#xD;
      smokers. II. Measure the steady state pharmacokinetics of phenethyl isothiocyanate required&#xD;
      to maintain a steady state of this substance during the hours of&#xD;
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) exposure in these patients. III. Obtain&#xD;
      preliminary data on the perturbation of NNK metabolism by phenethyl isothiocyanate in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients complete a questionnaire containing a smoking and dietary log to assess&#xD;
      cigarette and cruciferous vegetable consumption. Patients receive phenethyl isothiocyanate&#xD;
      orally 4 times a day for 30 days. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of&#xD;
      phenethyl isothiocyanate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is&#xD;
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities. Patients are followed on days 35, 36, and 43.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-27 patients will be accrued for this study over 4-6 months.&#xD;
