      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery may shrink the tumor so&#xD;
      that it can be removed during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or&#xD;
      without surgery in treating patients who have recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare survival and progression free survival in patients with ovarian epithelial&#xD;
           cancer after receiving treatment with chemotherapy with or without secondary&#xD;
           cytoreductive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of these treatment regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the complications related to surgical treatment in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the quality of life in these patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage&#xD;
      at initial diagnosis (early stage I-IIa vs advanced stage IIb-IV), length of interval from&#xD;
      end of prior first line chemotherapy (1-2 years vs more than 2 years), response to first 3&#xD;
      courses of second line induction chemotherapy in this study (no change vs partial remission&#xD;
      vs complete remission), number of measurable tumor lesions (1 vs more than 1), largest tumor&#xD;
      size of recurrence (less than 5 cm vs 5 cm or more), and participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive second line induction chemotherapy with either 3 courses of a 3-4 week&#xD;
      regimen or 6 courses of a weekly regimen of platinum based (cisplatin or carboplatin)&#xD;
      therapy. Patients with no change, partial remission, or complete remission are randomized to&#xD;
      one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery within 14 days of randomization.&#xD;
           Within 8 weeks after the last preoperative chemotherapy course, patients continue&#xD;
           platinum based chemotherapy every 3-4 weeks for at least 3 additional courses in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients continue platinum based chemotherapy for at least 3 additional courses&#xD;
           as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline; before the 4th or 6th course of chemotherapy or 1&#xD;
      week before surgery; after the 6th course of chemotherapy in the chemotherapy only arm OR&#xD;
      before the 4th or 6th course of chemotherapy in the surgery arm; 2 months after chemotherapy&#xD;
      or after the 6th course of chemotherapy in the surgery arm; and then every 6 months for up to&#xD;
      5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years or&#xD;
      until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 700 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.&#xD;
