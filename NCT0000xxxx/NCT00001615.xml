  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in&#xD;
      patients over the age of 60. The major cause of vision loss in this disease is due to the&#xD;
      development of choroidal neovascular membrane formation (CNVM). Several clinical trials have&#xD;
      proven that eyes with &quot;well-defined&quot; CNVM or lesions that can be readily demarcated with&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography can be successfully treated with laser photocoagulation. However, up&#xD;
      to 87% of eyes present with &quot;ill-defined&quot; CNVM or lesions that cannot be well demarcated on&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography and are not amenable to laser photocoagulation. No beneficial&#xD;
      treatment for this form of choroidal neovascularization has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathologic study has demonstrated the presence of inflammatory and reparative responses&#xD;
      in the retina of patients with ill-defined choroidal neovascularization. Since&#xD;
      corticosteroids have been shown to downregulate many of the cellular factors involved in both&#xD;
      inflammation and repair, the present study is designed to assess the ability of&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection around the eye to prevent severe vision loss associated with&#xD;
      &quot;ill-defined&quot; choroidal neovascularization in the setting of age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration. The study will be organized as a randomized open label control clinical trial&#xD;
      involving 2 phases. Phase 1 involving 40 patients will establish the feasibility and safety&#xD;
      of this treatment modality. Phase 2 will place emphasis on efficacy of the study.&#xD;
