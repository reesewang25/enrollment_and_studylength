      AMENDED: To provide ddC for patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who have failed treatment&#xD;
      with, are intolerant to or are ineligible to receive zidovudine (AZT) and to demonstrate that&#xD;
      ddC monotherapy is safe, and tolerable in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Original design: To provide zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) for patients with AIDS or&#xD;
      advanced AIDS-related complex (ARC) who have failed treatment with or are intolerant to&#xD;
      zidovudine (AZT) and who are also intolerant to dideoxyinosine (ddI); to demonstrate that ddC&#xD;
      monotherapy is safe and tolerable in the treatment of patients who previously experienced&#xD;
      either treatment failure, hematologic intolerance or myositis with AZT treatment and&#xD;
      pancreatitis or other toxicities (except peripheral neuropathy with ddI).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The first 50 patients enrolled into the study will be with investigators having prior ddC&#xD;
      experience, specifically AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), or non-ACTG investigators who are&#xD;
      listed in ddC protocols NIAID ACTG 012, 112, 047, 050, 106 (N3447), 114 (N3300), 119 (N3492),&#xD;
      N3226, or investigators at any ACTG center or ACTG satellite centers with knowledge of ddC&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all 50 patients have been entered and 25 have completed four weeks of treatment the&#xD;
      study will be dependent upon receipt of completed case forms up to week #4 of treatment for&#xD;
      the 25 patients who have been reviewed and evaluated for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 51-200 may then be entered by any physician licensed in his or her state who has&#xD;
      experience with AIDS patients and agrees to follow the patients as specified in the protocol.&#xD;
      After all 200 have been entered and week #16 case report forms are returned to the ddC&#xD;
      Coordinating Center and reviewed for safety for 100 of the 200 patients, the protocol would&#xD;
      be open without limit on numbers of patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recommended:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aerosolized Pentamidine or other prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia&#xD;
             (PCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs or treatments that could cause other serious additive toxicity when&#xD;
             coadministered with study medication will be allowed for treatment of an acute&#xD;
             intercurrent illness or opportunistic infection at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isoniazid, if there is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy at entry and the patient&#xD;
             is taking pyridoxine = or &gt; 50 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metronidazole, only with a study drug interruption; neurological exam should be&#xD;
             performed before and after treatment with metronidazole and ddC restarted only if&#xD;
             there are no signs, symptoms or neurological findings suggestive of peripheral&#xD;
             neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is recommended that patients requiring amphotericin, pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine,&#xD;
             intravenous trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole, ganciclovir, intravenous pentamidine,&#xD;
             intravenous acyclovir or acyclovir = or &gt; 1000 mg/day orally or other bone marrow or&#xD;
             renal toxic drugs have an interruption of ddC until they are stable for two weeks on a&#xD;
             maintenance dose of the above medications and only then can ddC be restarted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on amphotericin, pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim /&#xD;
             sulfamethoxazole, ganciclovir, intravenous acyclovir or acyclovir = or &gt; 1000 mg/day&#xD;
             orally or other bone marrow or renal toxic drugs may not tolerate concomitant ddC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If these drugs are given concomitantly with ddC, patients should have frequent&#xD;
             (weekly) laboratory assessments, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs that are nephrotoxic or have the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy might&#xD;
             be expected to cause increased toxicity when co-administered with ddC.&#xD;
