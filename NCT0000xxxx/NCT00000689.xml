  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the toxicity and effectiveness of adding sargramostim (recombinant&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor; GM-CSF) to a standard chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      combination (methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone) known as mBACOD in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients who are&#xD;
      infected with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of patients with AIDS-associated lymphoma is achieving inferior results when&#xD;
      compared with outcomes for non-AIDS patients. Treatment with mBACOD has been promising, but&#xD;
      the toxicity is very high. Patients treated with mBACOD have very low white blood cell&#xD;
      counts. GM-CSF has increased the number of white blood cells in animal studies and&#xD;
      preliminary human studies. It is hoped that including GM-CSF among the drugs given to&#xD;
      lymphoma patients will prevent or lessen the decrease in white blood cells caused by mBACOD.&#xD;

      Treatment of patients with AIDS-associated lymphoma is achieving inferior results when&#xD;
      compared with outcomes for non-AIDS patients. Treatment with mBACOD has been promising, but&#xD;
      the toxicity is very high. Patients treated with mBACOD have very low white blood cell&#xD;
      counts. GM-CSF has increased the number of white blood cells in animal studies and&#xD;
      preliminary human studies. It is hoped that including GM-CSF among the drugs given to&#xD;
      lymphoma patients will prevent or lessen the decrease in white blood cells caused by mBACOD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the study receive chemotherapy in 21-day cycles. The length of therapy,&#xD;
      2 - 8 months, depends on how the tumor responds to treatment. Four medicines are given on day&#xD;
      1 of each cycle by vein (IV) (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, vincristine). Dosages&#xD;
      of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are increased in later groups of patients if toxicity in&#xD;
      the first group is tolerable. A fifth medicine (dexamethasone) is given by mouth (PO) on days&#xD;
      1 - 5 of each cycle and the sixth medicine (methotrexate) is given IV on day 15 of each&#xD;
      cycle. Leucovorin is given after methotrexate to prevent methotrexate side effects. GM-CSF&#xD;
      treatment is started on day 3 and continued for 11 days. To prevent the spread of the tumor,&#xD;
      a spinal tap is done on 4 occasions to inject cytosine arabinoside directly into the spinal&#xD;
      fluid. If tumor cells are present in the spinal fluid, the patient also takes cytosine&#xD;
      arabinoside by spinal tap 3 x/week until the tumor cells disappear and then at monthly&#xD;
      intervals for 1 year. Patients with tumor cells in the spinal fluid are also given radiation&#xD;
      treatment to the head.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive HIV antibody by ELISA with Western blot confirmation, or positive HIV culture&#xD;
             or serum p24 antigen capture assay, or prior diagnosis of AIDS by the CDC surveillance&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathological diagnosis of large cell (cleaved or non-cleaved), immunoblastic, or small&#xD;
             non-cleaved lymphoma, stage I, II, III, or IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If displaying systemic (&quot;B&quot;) symptoms, evaluation for concurrent opportunistic&#xD;
             infections as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Buffy coat for Mycobacterium intracellulare-avium (MAI) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
             cultures; serum cryptococcal antigen; some measure of pulmonary function to exclude&#xD;
             Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia including chest x-ray and either gallium scan, blood&#xD;
             gases, or DLCO; stool culture and special stains for Salmonella, Isospora belli,&#xD;
             cryptosporidium, CMV, and MAI in patients with diarrhea; computerized tomography (CT)&#xD;
             scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain, or lumbar puncture for India ink,&#xD;
             acid-fast bacilli smear, cryptococcal antigen, or fungal/mycobacterial culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bone marrow involvement is permitted if the patient meets the hematologic criteria above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis or who are&#xD;
        diagnosed during treatment will receive cranial radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - The total dose of 2400 rads will be delivered at a rate of 200 rads/day to the mid plane&#xD;
        employing parallel opposing, lateral whole brain fields. The lower border of the field will&#xD;
        encompass C2 to cover the meninges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be treated 5 days/week, Monday through Friday, until the total&#xD;
             prescribed dose has been completed.&#xD;
