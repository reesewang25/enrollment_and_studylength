      The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy of intrathecal mafosfamide, a preactivated&#xD;
      derivative of cyclophosphamide against meningeal malignancies refractory to conventional&#xD;
      therapy (radiation therapy and chemotherapy). The maximally tolerated dose for intrathecal&#xD;
      mafosfamide will be established in a limited dosage escalation schedule. The CSF&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of intrathecal mafosfamide will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mafosfamide will be administered intrathecally on a bi-weekly basis for four weeks, followed&#xD;
      by twice monthly administration for four months and then monthly IT administration. A minimum&#xD;
      of 9 patients will be studied in each disease category (leukemias, lymphomas, and other&#xD;
      malignancies refractory to conventional therapy).&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients over 3 years of age with meningeal malignancies that are progressive or&#xD;
        refractory to conventional therapy will be eligible for this study. Patients with meningeal&#xD;
        malignancies secondary to an underlying solid tumor are eligible at initial diagnosis if&#xD;
        there is no conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis: Patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or other solid tumor who also have overt&#xD;
        meningeal involvement by their tumor. The definition of meningeal disease on this protocol&#xD;
        includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Leukemia/Lymphoma - CSF cell count greater than or equal to 5/mm(3) AND evidence of blast&#xD;
        cells on cytospin preparation or by cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Solid tumors - Presence of tumor cells on cytospin preparation or cytology OR presence of&#xD;
        measurable meningeal disease on CT or MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks and an ECOG performance status of&#xD;
        2 or better. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a&#xD;
        wheelchair will be considered ambulatory for the purposes of the performance score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients and/or their parents must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware&#xD;
        of the investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior intrathecal&#xD;
        chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy, prior to entering this study and must be&#xD;
        without significant systemic illness (e.g. infection). Patients must not have received any&#xD;
        CNS therapy within 1 week prior to starting treatment on this study or craniospinal&#xD;
        irradiation within 8 weeks prior to starting treatment on this study. Patients must not&#xD;
        have received intrathecal chemotherapy within 1 week (2 weeks if prior DTC101).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have clinically significant abnormalities with regard to liver function,&#xD;
        renal function or metabolic parameters (electrolytes, calcium and phosphorus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        A Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) must be offered to all patients greater than or equal to&#xD;
        18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients receiving other therapy (either intrathecal or systematic) designed specifically&#xD;
        to treat their meningeal malignancy are not eligible for this study. However, patients&#xD;
        receiving concomitant chemotherapy to control systemic or bulk CNS disease will be&#xD;
        eligible, provided the systemic chemotherapy is not a phase I agent, an agent which&#xD;
        significantly penetrates the CNS (e.g., high dose methotrexate, (greater than 1 gm/m(2)),&#xD;
        thiotepa, high dose cytarabine, (greater than 2 gm/m(2) per day), 5-fluorouracil,&#xD;
        intravenous 6-mercaptopurine or topotecan), or an agent known to have serious unpredictable&#xD;
        CNS side effects. Careful documentation of systemic drugs being administered concurrently&#xD;
        is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with clinical evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus or compartmentalization of the&#xD;
        CSF flow as documented by a radioisotope Indium(111) or Technitium(99) - DTPA flow study&#xD;
        are not eligible for this protocol. If a CSF flow block or compartmentalization is&#xD;
        demonstrated, focal radiotherapy to the site of the block to restore flow and a repeat CSF&#xD;
        flow study showing clearing of the blockage is required for the patient to be eligible for&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have leukemia or lymphoma and a concomitant bone marrow relapse are not&#xD;
        eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing age must not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received any other systemic investigational agent within 14 days prior&#xD;
        to, or during, study treatment. The 14 day period should be extended if the patient&#xD;
        received any investigational agent which is known to have delayed toxicities after 14 days.&#xD;
        Patients must not have received any other intrathecal investigational agent within 7 days&#xD;
        prior to, or during, study treatment. The 7 day period should be extended if the patient&#xD;
        received any investigational agent which is known to have delayed toxicities after 7 days&#xD;
        or a prolonged half-life.&#xD;
