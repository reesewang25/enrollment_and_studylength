      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug Leflunomide to treat&#xD;
      uveitis-an inflammation of the eye caused by an immune system abnormality. Leflunomide&#xD;
      suppresses immune system activity and has been shown to control autoimmune diseases, such as&#xD;
      arthritis (joint inflammation), in animals. It has also improved symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, and the Food and Drug Administration has approved it for treating&#xD;
      patients with this disease. Eye and joint inflammation may have similar causes, and medicines&#xD;
      for arthritis often help patients with eye inflammation. This study will examine whether&#xD;
      Leflunomide can help patients with uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with uveitis who are not responding well to steroid treatment and patients who have&#xD;
      side effects from other medicines used to treat uveitis (such as cyclosporine,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate or azathioprine) or have refused treatment because of possible&#xD;
      side effects of these medicines may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history, physical examination, blood test and eye examination. The eye exam&#xD;
      includes a check of vision and eye pressure, examination of the back of the eye (retina) with&#xD;
      an ophthalmoscope and the front of the eye with a microscope. They will also undergo a&#xD;
      procedure called fluorescein angiography to look at the blood vessels of the eye. A dye&#xD;
      called sodium fluorescein is injected into the bloodstream through a vein. After the dye&#xD;
      reaches the blood vessels of the eye, photographs are taken of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be divided into two groups. One group will take 100 milligrams of&#xD;
      Leflunomide once a day for 3 days and then 20 milligrams once a day for 6 months. The other&#xD;
      group will take a placebo-a pill that looks like the Leflunomide pill but does not contain&#xD;
      the medicine. All patients in both groups will also take prednisone. Patients will have&#xD;
      follow-up examinations at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 (6 months) of the study. Each&#xD;
      follow-up visit will include a repeat of the screening exams and an evaluation of side&#xD;
      effects or discomfort from the medicine. Those who do well and want to continue their&#xD;
      assigned treatment after 6 months can continue that treatment for another 6 months and will&#xD;
      have follow-up exams at months 9 and 12.&#xD;

      Although corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy for intraocular inflammation, many&#xD;
      patients are intolerant or resistant to corticosteroid therapy. In these patients, other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents have been employed to control potentially sight-threatening uveitis.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, ideal therapy for these patients remains elusive, and there is a need for new&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents with varying modes of action and side effect profiles. Leflunomide,&#xD;
      an isoxazole derivative, has profound immunosuppressive activity. Leflunomide inhibits&#xD;
      autoimmune disease in animal models and has been used to treat patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA). We propose a randomized masked pilot trial of leflunomide versus placebo for&#xD;
      the treatment of uveitis. Sixteen patients 16 years of age or older with active intermediate,&#xD;
      posterior, or panuveitis will be randomly assigned to receive prednisone and leflunomide or&#xD;
      prednisone and placebo. Patients will then have the prednisone tapered according to a&#xD;
      standardized schedule. The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of leflunomide versus placebo. The primary safety endpoint is the frequency of any&#xD;
      of the following: abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash, hypertension, and alopecia. In&#xD;
      addition, weight loss distributions and change in liver function tests will be described. The&#xD;
      primary efficacy endpoint is any one or more of the following (1) a decrease of 10 or more&#xD;
      letters in visual acuity from the baseline score for any reason, or (2) inability to taper&#xD;
      prednisone to 10 mg qd by week 16 post randomization, or (3) inability to maintain the&#xD;
      prednisone taper through Month 6 or Month 12, or (4) the addition of systemic therapy to&#xD;
      treat ocular inflammatory disease. Secondary outcomes will include change in vitreous haze&#xD;
      and presence or absence of cystoid macular edema.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of current intermediate or posterior uveitis, or panuveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current evidence of active intraocular inflammation based on the presence of vitreous haze,&#xD;
        active retinal lesions, retinal vasculitis, or cystoid macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        16 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Visual acuity of 73 letters or fewer (Snellen equivalent: 20/40 or worse) in at least one&#xD;
        eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The ability to understand and sign an informed consent form which must be obtained prior to&#xD;
        randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of intermediate uveitis requires the presence of vitritis and either&#xD;
        peripheral retinal vascular disease, cellular debris in the inferior vitreous (vitreous&#xD;
        snowballs), exudate on the pars plana, or peripheral retinal infiltrates. The diagnosis of&#xD;
        posterior uveitis requires the presence of infiltrative retinal lesions involving the&#xD;
        posterior pole of the eye, usually with vitritis and often times with cystoid macular&#xD;
        edema. The amount of cystoid macular edema will be graded by a standard protocol using&#xD;
        Fluorescein Angiogram. The diagnosis of pan-uveitis requires the finding of active anterior&#xD;
        segment inflammation, vitritis, and infiltrative retinal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ocular or systemic disease requiring greater than 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or greater than&#xD;
        80 mg qd if patients weigh more than 80 kg, or requiring other systemic immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Periocular injections of corticosteroids within the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intolerance or contraindications to corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female who is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient refuses to use contraception during the study and 24 months after termination of&#xD;
        active study therapy or undergo a cholestyramine washout regimen or an activated charcoal&#xD;
        regimen under the care of a physician following termination of study therapy, if&#xD;
        child-bearing or fathering potential exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Behcet's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of Latanoprost within 2 weeks prior to enrollment, or current or likely need for&#xD;
        Latanoprost during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hypersensitivity to fluorescein dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindications to use of steroids at dose and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        SGOT (AST) or SGPT(ALT) greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allergic or hypersensitivity to leflunomide or any excipients.&#xD;
