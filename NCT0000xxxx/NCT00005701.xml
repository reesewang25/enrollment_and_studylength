      To conduct a series of five inter-related studies on acute cardiac ischemia (ACI) in women.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute cardiac ischemia (ACI), including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina&#xD;
      pectoris, is the leading cause of death in women in the US. Despite growing interest in&#xD;
      ischemic (coronary) cardiac disease in women, little research has focused on women in the&#xD;
      most common site of ACI initial evaluation and care: the emergency department (ED). Improving&#xD;
      medical care quality and outcomes for ACI in women will require an understanding of gender's&#xD;
      influence on initial ED presentation, diagnosis, triage, treatment, and outcomes.The detail&#xD;
      of prospectively-collected data and number of patients available for this project with the&#xD;
      resulting large statistical power (while savings the cost of the $1.8 million ACI-TIPI Trial&#xD;
      data collection effort) and the experience of the CCHSR in over a decade of related studies&#xD;
      of factors influencing the triage, treatment, and outcome of ED patients with ACI, provide&#xD;
      this project with substantial promise of new and useful results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five studies included. STUDY I: Were women's emergency department (ED) presentations of&#xD;
      ACI different from men's? STUDY II: Were there differences between women and men in the ED&#xD;
      diagnosis and triage of patients with chest pain and other symptoms suggestive of ACI? STUDY&#xD;
      III: Were there differences between women and men in the use of non-invasive and invasive&#xD;
      treatments among patients presenting to the ED with ACI? STUDY IV: Were there significant&#xD;
      differences between women and men in medical outcomes during the acute event and within 30&#xD;
      days following ED presentation with ACI? STUDY V: Had differences between women and men in&#xD;
      their ED presentation, diagnosis, and/or triage for chest pain or other symptoms compatible&#xD;
      with ACI changed over the past 10-15 years? In studying the impact of gender, these studies&#xD;
      also included analyses for primary and interaction effects related to patient&#xD;
      sociodemographic features, ED presenting clinical features, physician type and training,&#xD;
      hospital type and ED setting, health insurance type, and include adjustments for patients'&#xD;
      probabilities of having ACI as well as their likelihood of acute cardiac mortality.&#xD;
