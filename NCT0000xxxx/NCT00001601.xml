  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with diseases of the mouth or systemic&#xD;
      diseases that involve the mouth. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather,&#xD;
      patients will receive current standard of care treatments. The purposes of the study are: 1)&#xD;
      to allow NIDCR's Gene Therapy and Therapeutics Branch staff to gain more knowledge about oral&#xD;
      soft tissue diseases and possibly identify new avenues of research in this area; and 2) to&#xD;
      establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are developed.&#xD;
      (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision will be&#xD;
      voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of any age with oral diseases or systemic diseases involving the mouth may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Women of childbearing potential and women who are pregnant or&#xD;
      breastfeeding will only have tests and procedures and receive medications that pose no&#xD;
      greater than a minimal risk to the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a comprehensive dental and medical examination, including a physical&#xD;
      examination of the head and neck. Additional tests and procedures that may be required for&#xD;
      diagnosis and to guide treatment include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests - for routine laboratory studies, assessment of kidney and liver&#xD;
           function, and detection of viruses, fungi, bacteria or parasites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram - to record the electrical activity of the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies - to examine tissue under the microscope. The method and number of biopsies&#xD;
           depends on the individual's specific condition and the tissue to be removed. For all&#xD;
           biopsies a local anesthetic (lidocaine with or without epinephrine) is injected at the&#xD;
           biopsy site. A punch biopsy uses a small sharp cookie-cutter instrument to remove a&#xD;
           small (about 1/10- to 1/5-inch) piece of skin. An excisional biopsy uses a small&#xD;
           surgical knife or scalpel to remove a piece of tissue, usually requiring some stitches&#xD;
           to close the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic imaging - X-rays, photographs, or other tests as needed for diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments include tablets, injections and topically applied medications. All preparations&#xD;
      are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are commercially available. Patient&#xD;
      follow-up may vary from one visit to intermittent visits over a number of years, depending on&#xD;
      the patient's condition.&#xD;

      The function of this protocol is to support the training of residents in Oral Medicine in the&#xD;
      management of oral soft tissue diseases. Patients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated&#xD;
      and treated according to available standard procedures and therapeutic modalities. Samples of&#xD;
      blood and oral tissues will be studied by routine and specialized investigative methods to&#xD;
      establish the diagnoses, responses to treatment, and/or disease progression.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of any age, both genders, and all racial/ethnic groups with oral diseases or&#xD;
        systemic diseases with oral manifestations that will help the branch fulfill the objectives&#xD;
        listed in Section 1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential, or who are pregnant or lactating, will only undergo tests&#xD;
        and procedures, and/or receive medications for which data exists proving minimal risk to&#xD;
        the fetus and/or child. Only diagnosis without radiographs will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        A written referral is needed from the patient's physician or dentist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with significant cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnancy or lactation, if this status precludes proposed diagnostic procedures or&#xD;
        therapies because of unknown, untoward effects on mother and/or child.&#xD;
