  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how beginning or changing anti-HIV medications affects&#xD;
      the body composition (weight, height, growth, body fat, and muscle mass, or fat and muscle&#xD;
      distribution) of HIV-infected children. This study also looks at how changes in body&#xD;
      composition relate to changes in viral load (level of HIV in the blood), CD4 cell counts,&#xD;
      height, and weight in HIV-infected children. This study also compares changes in body&#xD;
      composition to levels of cytokines (proteins in the body that affect some immune cells) in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children who are beginning or changing anti-HIV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though studies have been done on adults, little is known about the effects of HIV infection&#xD;
      and anti-HIV drugs on body composition in children. One theory is that changes in body&#xD;
      composition can predict the failure of anti-HIV treatment. If this is true, body composition&#xD;
      measurements can be as useful as CD4+ cell counts in determining drug effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite accumulating data in adults, little information is available regarding the effects of&#xD;
      HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy on body composition in children. Preliminary&#xD;
      information indicates that lean body mass is lost in preference to fat mass in HIV-infected&#xD;
      children, supporting the theory that failure to thrive in HIV infection is often cytokine&#xD;
      mediated. It can be hypothesized that changes in body composition (lean body mass) may&#xD;
      predict changes in weight growth velocity and may give an early clinical indication of&#xD;
      treatment failure. If so, body composition measurement may yield an additional outcome&#xD;
      measure for clinical trials, equivalent in utility to other laboratory measures of treatment&#xD;
      response, e.g., persistent CD4+ cell count changes. Additionally, if body composition changes&#xD;
      are highly correlated with responses in viral load, body composition may prove to be a more&#xD;
      affordable measure of antiretroviral effectiveness in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a nonrandomized, observational study. Children are recruited to each of 4 age&#xD;
      strata:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum A: 1 month to 18 months. Stratum B: greater than 18 months to 3 years. Stratum C:&#xD;
      greater than 3 years to 8 years. Stratum D: greater than 8 years to less than 13 years.&#xD;
      Children beginning or changing antiretroviral therapy and fulfilling the study specifications&#xD;
      may be enrolled in the study. Children have 5 outpatient clinic visits, at entry and at 12,&#xD;
      24, 36, and 48 weeks, for anthropometry, body composition by bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      analysis, cytokine levels, viral load, CD4+ cell count, and markers of lipid and glucose&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are 1 month to 12 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-1 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not begun puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are beginning or changing anti-HIV therapy and:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) have never used anti-HIV drugs and are starting any anti-HIV therapy; or (2) have&#xD;
             never used protease inhibitors (PIs) and are starting a PI-containing therapy; or (3)&#xD;
             have used PIs in the past and are changing anti-HIV treatment and have never used at&#xD;
             least 2 of the drugs in the new therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use metal artificial body parts or electrical devices that have been inserted into the&#xD;
             body (such as a pacemaker).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had an arm or leg removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a physical disability that would prevent an accurate measurement of body height&#xD;
             or length.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have diabetes and need insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have or have had a serious illness or fever in the 14 days before entering study&#xD;
             (except an upper respiratory infection without a fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have used steroids (corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, or megestrol acetate),&#xD;
             interleukin, interferon, thalidomide, or GH within 180 days before entering study.&#xD;
             Glucocorticoids are allowed as long as treatment did not occur during the 14 days&#xD;
             before entering study and total treatment in the 180 days before entering study was&#xD;
             not more than 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have used anti-HIV medication, if they are beginning any anti-HIV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have used PIs, if they are beginning a PI-containing regimen. (Prior use of PIs is&#xD;
             allowed if child is changing anti-HIV treatment and he/she has never used at least 2&#xD;
             of the drugs in the new therapy.)&#xD;
