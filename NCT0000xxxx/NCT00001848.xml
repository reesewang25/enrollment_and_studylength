  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women with lower abdominal pain have endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in&#xD;
      which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is found outside of the uterus. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      endometriosis is usually made at surgery. The treatment of endometriosis includes medical and&#xD;
      surgical approaches alone or in combination. The hormone estrogen stimulates the growth of&#xD;
      the endometrium and may also stimulate the growth of endometriosis. Medical therapies that&#xD;
      act to decrease the level of estrogen can reduce the amount of endometriosis and pain. When&#xD;
      therapies are discontinued, symptoms often return. In addition, medical treatment for&#xD;
      endometriosis is expensive and is often associated with weak bones (osteoporosis) and hot&#xD;
      flashes as a result of low levels of estrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment is removal or destruction of the endometriosis tissue. Studies show the&#xD;
      pain from endometriosis is relieved longer with tissue removal than with destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was developed to see if surgery followed by daily doses of Raloxifene (Evista) is&#xD;
      effective in reducing pain, for a longer time than surgery in combination with a placebo&#xD;
      (inactive &quot;sugar pill&quot;) treatment. Raloxifene acts like estrogens in some tissues and not&#xD;
      like estrogens in others. Postmenopausal women receiving Raloxifene for the prevention of&#xD;
      osteoporosis had an increase in bone density and an improvement of their blood lipids (fat&#xD;
      content in the blood). However, unlike estrogen, Raloxifene does not promote the growth of&#xD;
      breast tissue or the uterus. If Raloxifene blocks estrogen action in the lining of the uterus&#xD;
      (endometrium) of reproductive age women, as it does in post-menopausal women, it may also&#xD;
      limit the growth of endometriosis and prevent the return of pain.&#xD;

      Many women with pelvic pain have endometriosis, a condition in which tissue from the uterine&#xD;
      lining (endometrium) is also outside the uterus. Endometriosis pain often returns after&#xD;
      medical treatment is stopped. Surgical therapies have had varied success in reducing pain,&#xD;
      with laparoscopic excision of implants one of the most effective methods. Raloxifene (Evista&#xD;
      (Trademark), Lilly), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in&#xD;
      preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women. This compound has effects that are both similar&#xD;
      to and different from those of the hormone estrogen. Unlike estrogen, raloxifene does not&#xD;
      stimulate growth of the uterus or breast tissue in post-menopausal women. If raloxifene&#xD;
      blocks estrogen action in the lining of the uterus (or endometrium) of reproductive age&#xD;
      women, as it does in postmenopausal women, it may also limit growth of endometriosis and&#xD;
      prevent the return of pain. This phase II randomized placebo-controlled study evaluates&#xD;
      whether surgery followed by daily administration of raloxifene for six months reduces pain&#xD;
      for a longer time than surgery alone.&#xD;
