      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for the effects of social support on&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Both hypotheses operate through effects on risk&#xD;
      factors for coronary heart disease, specifically arterial blood pressure and serum lipids.&#xD;
      The stress- buffering hypothesis states that social support functions as a social resource&#xD;
      for individuals exposed to social stressors; those persons with more support are less&#xD;
      vulnerable to the risk-enhancing effects of stressors. The health behavior hypothesis states&#xD;
      that persons with more support engage in more positive health behaviors, such as avoiding&#xD;
      tobacco; moderate alcohol use; exercise; and, a prudent diet. A major limitation in research&#xD;
      to evaluate these alternative hypotheses has been the failure to conceptualize and measure&#xD;
      social support in a way appropriate to detect its effects in varying social and cultural&#xD;
      contexts. This is a major issue in research in sub-cultural communities that are also high&#xD;
      risk communities, such as African-Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional survey of social stressors, social supports, health behaviors, and arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure and serum lipids was conducted in a Black community in the rural South to&#xD;
      evaluate the relative strengths of the stress-buffering versus the health behavior&#xD;
      hypothesis. Social support was measured using a culturally appropriate technique which was&#xD;
      sensitive both to the distinction between kin and nonkin social support, and the modification&#xD;
      of the effects of that support by generational status. Multiple regression analysis and path&#xD;
      analysis were used to evaluate the alternative hypotheses.&#xD;
