      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia are rare but serious blood diseases that can be caused by&#xD;
      drugs and other environmental factors. In 1980, there were only limited quantitative&#xD;
      estimates of the risk between various exposures, particularly drugs, and the two dyscrasias.&#xD;
      The data were collected in the IAAAS, a multicenter population-based case-control study&#xD;
      conducted from 1980 to 1986 in eight regions. The study was funded by a pharmaceutical&#xD;
      company to investigate a single hypothesis, but information was obtained on all drugs and on&#xD;
      other factors, enabling a general investigation of the dyscrasias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was for retrospective data analysis only. Standard case-control methods were used.&#xD;
      In most instances, multivariate analysis was used to control confounding, especially by&#xD;
      simultaneous use of other causal drugs. Adverse effects and the relative safety of drugs in&#xD;
      relation to the two dyscrasias were documented. Because the IAAAS was population-based,&#xD;
      incidence rates were provided directly, and excess risks were estimated for associated drugs.&#xD;
      Such quantitative measures of association were generally unavailable. Among the drugs that&#xD;
      were analyzed were various categories such as psychotropics, antihistamines, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular drugs, and individual drugs such as allopurinol. Factors other than drugs were&#xD;
      also evaluated, including exposure to radiation and chemicals such as benzene and&#xD;
      insecticides, history of viral infection, and history of allergy and other conditions.&#xD;
