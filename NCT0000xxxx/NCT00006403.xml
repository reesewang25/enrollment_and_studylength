      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that inflammation plays a major role in the&#xD;
      development of coronary artery disease. High sensitivity C-reactive protein assays have been&#xD;
      shown to be independent risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. Measurements of&#xD;
      C-reactive protein also adds to the predictive value of lipid levels in determining the risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease. Levels of inflammatory markers may also correlate with response to&#xD;
      commonly used lipid lowering agents. The exact role of inflammation in coronary artery&#xD;
      disease is not clear; however, it has been suggested that inflammation may be a marker of&#xD;
      subclinical cardiovascular disease, or may indicate the presence of vulnerable plaque. In&#xD;
      addition to being a possible causative agent in the development of atherogenesis, it has been&#xD;
      postulated that inflammatory markers may reflect events that predict the development of&#xD;
      myocardial events. The fact that agents such as aspirin and pravastatin, which are known to&#xD;
      have anti-inflammatory effects, are effective agents in the prevention of atherosclerosis&#xD;
      suggests the possibility that prevention of inflammation may play an important role in&#xD;
      reduction of risk for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study assessed inflammatory markers in 3,765 men and women of the Framingham Study. The&#xD;
      markers included inflammatory (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, soluble intercellular adhesion&#xD;
      molecule-1, endothelin-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and&#xD;
      oxidative stress markers (8-epi-PGF 2alpha, thromboxane B2). The relation between CVD risk&#xD;
      factors and systemic markers of vascular inflammation was determined. The relations between&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, endothelial dysfunction, and subclinical disease were analyzed. Markers&#xD;
      of inflammation were related to prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease events&#xD;
      adjusting for standard risk factors. The central hypothesis was that inflammatory markers&#xD;
      were independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease events with endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      operating in the causal pathway.&#xD;
