      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a problem of significant public health concern both in this and other western&#xD;
      countries. One reason is that it is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, most notably&#xD;
      hypertension. For example, in the Framingham study it was found that relative body weight,&#xD;
      weight change during observation, and skin fold thickness were related to existing blood&#xD;
      pressure levels and to the subsequent rate of development of hypertension. Additionally, for&#xD;
      previously normotensive individuals, the risk of developing hypertension was proportional to&#xD;
      the degree of overweight. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type II diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      On the other hand, some overweight individuals are physically healthy but suffer from the&#xD;
      psychosocial consequences of their condition so that losing weight would be desirable for&#xD;
      them as well as for individuals more at risk for physical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like essential hypertension, obesity is not only a chronic condition for many individuals but&#xD;
      it is also a heterogeneous condition with many underlying causes and interacting factors. It&#xD;
      is generally difficult to treat because it is a chronic problem, success comes slowly, and&#xD;
      physicians in practice generally understand the condition rather poorly and do not manage it&#xD;
      well. Results from studies of caloric restriction, behavior modification and medication have&#xD;
      often been disappointing both to the subjects and their physicians. In practice, dropout&#xD;
      rates from exercise programs, as well as various dietary self-help programs have been&#xD;
      relatively high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, in clinical trials dropout rates have often been quite high. Compounding the&#xD;
      problem of weight management has been a rather universal negative bias on the part of&#xD;
      physicians to prescribing anorexiant medications. It was previously generally held that these&#xD;
      agents were either only effective in the short term or not at all. Additionally, there has&#xD;
      always been concern about the potential adverse effects of anorexiants as well as their&#xD;
      potential for abuse. Physicians who used appetite suppressants often prescribed them for only&#xD;
      four to six weeks which was inappropriate in the management of a chronic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several relatively short term clinical trials (e.g., 16 weeks), it has been shown that&#xD;
      appetite control medications such as fenfluramine and phentermine were more effective than&#xD;
      placebo in inducing weight loss. It has been less clear from the trials performed heretofore&#xD;
      how effective anorectic medications were when used as an adjunct to behavior modification and&#xD;
      diet. This aspect was addressed in the first two years of the clinical trial under&#xD;
      consideration here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second controversial issue concerned the duration of efficacy of anorexiant agents.&#xD;
      Originally it was felt that tolerance developed, hence the recommendations for short courses&#xD;
      of treatment. A few long-term double-blind studies using anorexiants have since demonstrated&#xD;
      that they exert beneficial effects for up to 24 weeks, as evidenced by weight loss and&#xD;
      maintenance of weight loss. This was an important finding given, as noted earlier, the&#xD;
      chronicity of the problem of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The so-called stimulant anorexiants, like phentermine, are believed to act via central&#xD;
      catecholamine mechanisms. Side-effects include nervousness, insomnia, increased motor&#xD;
      activity and cardiovascular disturbances such as tachycardia and elevation of blood pressure.&#xD;
      The latter effects led physicians to feel that their use in obese hypertensive patients was&#xD;
      very limited. Fenfluramine, although chemically related to the stimulant anorexiants, appears&#xD;
      to act via serotonergic mechanisms. It reportedly causes sedation, occasionally diarrhea and&#xD;
      few cardiovascular effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind, fixed sample. After a six-week single-blind placebo controlled diet and&#xD;
      behavior modification period, participants entered a parallel-group comparison of&#xD;
      fenfluramine plus phentermine versus placebo. In the third and fourth years of the study,&#xD;
      patients were randomly assigned to either continuous therapy or intermittent therapy. The&#xD;
      intermittent therapy group received the medication for three months from April through June&#xD;
      and during the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's day.&#xD;
