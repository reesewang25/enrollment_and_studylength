  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To relate distribution of adipose tissue measured by a then new imaging technique, Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) to extracranial carotid atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease risk&#xD;
      factors, and to more conventional measures of fat distribution such as body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      and waist/hip ratio. The primary hypothesis was that patients with extracranial carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (cases) had more intra-abdominal fat and a higher ratio of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      fat to total or subcutaneous fat than age-sex-race matched controls.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was ancillary to an NIH funded population-based project, the Atherosclerosis Risk&#xD;
      in Communities Study (ARIC) that is ongoing in Forsyth County, North Carolina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using MRI, the investigators sought to demonstrate strong relationships between&#xD;
      intra-abdominal fat and a number of cardiovascular disease risk factors, including history of&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, family history of cardiovascular disease, plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of triglyceride, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL2 cholesterol,&#xD;
      apo A1, Apo B, postprandial lipid response to a fat rich meal, glucose, insulin, sex hormone&#xD;
      binding globulin, and total and free testosterone. Certain other risk factors were less&#xD;
      certain to show a relation to intra-abdominal fat as measured by MRI, including various&#xD;
      hemostatic factors, as well as certain dietary factors such as consumption of alcohol,&#xD;
      dietary fat, and cholesterol, but this research afforded an opportunity to explore these&#xD;
      relationships. Finally, the investigators proposed to relate intra-abdominal fat to more&#xD;
      conventional measures of fat distribution (waist/hip ratio, subscapular skinfold thickness,&#xD;
      etc.) in an attempt to identify strong correlates of intra-abdominal fat that could be more&#xD;
      easily measured.&#xD;
