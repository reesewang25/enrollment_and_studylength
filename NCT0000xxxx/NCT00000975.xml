      To evaluate the feasibility of itraconazole as (1) primary therapy in histoplasmosis and (2)&#xD;
      maintenance therapy after completion of primary therapy. To evaluate the effect of therapy of&#xD;
      CNS histoplasmosis. To determine if resistance to drug occurs in patients who fail therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Although the&#xD;
      clinical response to amphotericin B treatment in the AIDS patients is generally good,&#xD;
      administration difficulties and toxicity detract from its usefulness. Oral treatment with&#xD;
      ketoconazole overcomes these limitations of amphotericin B, but does not appear to be&#xD;
      effective for primary treatment in patients with AIDS. Itraconazole is a triazole compound in&#xD;
      which preclinical studies have demonstrated activity against Histoplasmosis capsulatum.&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have also shown that itraconazole appears effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      histoplasmosis. The frequency of adverse reactions to itraconazole has been low in several&#xD;
      studies. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in up to 20 percent of patients with&#xD;
      histoplasmosis, and appears to have a poor response to amphotericin B treatment. Itraconazole&#xD;
      has been used successfully in a small number of patients with cryptococcal meningitis,&#xD;
      supporting a study of its use in CNS histoplasmosis.&#xD;

      supporting a study of its use in CNS histoplasmosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 30 patients with AIDS and an initial episode of disseminated histoplasmosis are&#xD;
      selected for this study. Up to 5 patients will have a diagnosis of CNS histoplasmosis.&#xD;
      Therapy with all other systemic antifungal agents must be halted before study entry. Patients&#xD;
      receive itraconazole for 3 days followed by daily oral doses for a total of 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients who are doing well clinically, without evidence of clinical failure or dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity, are permitted to continue maintenance therapy to prevent relapse at a reduced dose&#xD;
      for an additional 12 months. Patients who are being treated for CNS histoplasmosis will&#xD;
      continue to receive itraconazole.&#xD;
