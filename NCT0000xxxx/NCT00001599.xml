  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of thalidomide in treating Sjogren's&#xD;
      syndrome. In this autoimmune disease, the immune system attacks the body's tear glands and&#xD;
      salivary glands, causing dry mouth and dry eyes. Thalidomide has shown promise in treating&#xD;
      other autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with Sjogren's syndrome who have dry eyes and dry mouth may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Women of childbearing potential will not be considered for participation because of severe&#xD;
      birth defects associated with thalidomide. Also, since Sjogren's syndrome affects many fewer&#xD;
      men than women, men are excluded from this pilot study because they would be too few in&#xD;
      number to assess as a separate group. Candidates will be screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and pregnancy&#xD;
      test. Tests will also be done to measure the conduction of electrical impulses along the&#xD;
      nerves and to evaluate dryness of the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to take either thalidomide or a placebo (look-alike&#xD;
      pill with no active ingredient). The thalidomide dosage will be increased gradually from a&#xD;
      starting dose of 50 Mg. up to 300 Mg., depending on side effects. Women of childbearing age&#xD;
      who have had a tubal ligation or longstanding infertility will have a pregnancy test every 2&#xD;
      or 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the clinic at the first study visit and again at weeks 4, 8 and 12&#xD;
      for some or all of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient assessment of dry mouth (rated on a scale from &quot;worst ever&quot; to &quot;best ever&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient assessment of dry eyes (rated on a scale from &quot;worst ever&quot; to &quot;best ever&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient health questionnaire and disease assessment rating&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rose-Bengal or other dye tests for dryness - examination of the eyes under a bright&#xD;
           light following administration of drops containing a dye&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schirmer's I test for dryness - placement of a thin rectangular strip of filter paper in&#xD;
           the eye following administration of anesthetic drops&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cell counts and levels of various immune substances in the&#xD;
           blood, and to evaluate liver and kidney function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests to evaluate kidney function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve conduction tests - measurement of the speed with which nerves conduct electrical&#xD;
           impulses. Two nerves in the arm and one nerve in the leg will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be contacted by telephone every week to report any side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women. SS&#xD;
      is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands leading to&#xD;
      secretory function loss, and the symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth. After bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation, most patients with chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) develop symptoms&#xD;
      of oral dryness and salivary gland lymphocytic infiltrates indistinguishable from SS.&#xD;
      Thalidomide has not been studied as a treatment for Sjogren's syndrome, but pilot studies&#xD;
      suggest that it may be beneficial in the treatment of a number of autoimmune diseases&#xD;
      including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and various skin disorders, as&#xD;
      well as in the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease. Major adverse effects of&#xD;
      thalidomide include teratogenicity, neuropathy and sedation. The study is a 12 week&#xD;
      randomized, double-blinded, pilot clinical trial designed to screen for potential efficacy&#xD;
      and to evaluate the safety and potential adverse effects of 300 mg thalidomide daily compared&#xD;
      with placebo in 28 patients with primary SS (PSS).&#xD;
