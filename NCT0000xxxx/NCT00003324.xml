      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells in a single high&#xD;
      dose. Combining radiation therapy with surgery may be a more effective treatment for brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without&#xD;
      surgery in treating patients who have brain metastases.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop prognostic factors for patients with brain metastases treated by focal treatment&#xD;
           without concurrent whole brain irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether focal treatment without whole brain radiotherapy produces good&#xD;
           long-term outcome in patients with four or less cerebral metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess survival, physical and cognitive functioning, and quality of life of patients&#xD;
           treated on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Quality of life is assessed using the FACT-BR scale, physical function is assessed&#xD;
      using the FIM scale, and cognition is assessed using two brief pencil and paper tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive focal therapy for cerebral metastases by any combination of (1) surgery plus&#xD;
      fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to surgical bed, or (2) single fraction stereotactic&#xD;
      radiotherapy by linear accelerator with or without a radiation sensitizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 2 and 10 weeks, then every 3 months for 18 months, then every 6&#xD;
      months for 3 years, then annually. Quality of life is assessed at each followup visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering intracerebral relapse are offered further focal therapy if they have no&#xD;
      more than 3 metastases, no more than 6 lesions over consecutive scans, and continue to have&#xD;
      life expectancy of at least 3 months and Karnofsky performance status of 60-100%. Otherwise,&#xD;
      relapsed patients are offered whole brain radiotherapy or supportive treatment with steroids,&#xD;
      and may also receive stereotactic boost to the new lesions. Patients who have received prior&#xD;
      whole brain irradiation will be offered entry into other protocols if eligible or supportive&#xD;
      treatment with steroids. Patients are followed as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 60 patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
