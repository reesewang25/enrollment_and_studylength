      To examine the natural history of mortality due to coronary heart disease in post-myocardial&#xD;
      infarction patients from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) and the Aspirin&#xD;
      Myocardial Infarction Study (AMIS).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In January 1990, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute issued a Program Announcement&#xD;
      establishing a Small Grants Program to provide limited support to extend analyses of research&#xD;
      data generated by clinical trials, population research, and demonstration and education&#xD;
      studies. This study used data collected in two completed clinical trials, the BHAT and AMIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints included all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality such as sudden death,&#xD;
      recurrent and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and incident congestive heart failure.&#xD;
      Univariate and multivariate analyses of baseline data variables from BHAT were conducted to&#xD;
      determine which were predictive of study endpoints. Baseline variables included&#xD;
      sociodemograhic characteristics, medical history, medication use, physical examination finds,&#xD;
      and electrocardiographic characteristics. Baseline characteristics found to be predictive of&#xD;
      study endpoints in the BHAT placebo group were examined in the AMIS placebo group. Long- and&#xD;
      short-term prognoses for patients suffering a transmural myocardial infarction were compared&#xD;
      for those suffering a subendocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
