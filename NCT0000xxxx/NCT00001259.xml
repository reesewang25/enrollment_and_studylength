  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of estrogen and progesterone on mood, the stress response,&#xD;
      and brain function and behavior in women with premenstrual syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously this study has demonstrated leuprolide acetate (Lupron (Registered Trademark)) to&#xD;
      be an effective treatment for PMS. The current purpose of this study is to evaluate how low&#xD;
      levels of estrogen and progesterone (that occur during treatment with leuprolide acetate)&#xD;
      compare to menstrual cycle levels of estrogen and progesterone (given during individual&#xD;
      months of hormone add-back) on a variety of physiologic measures (brain imaging, stress&#xD;
      testing, etc.) in women with PMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PMS is a condition characterized by changes in mood and behavior that occur during the second&#xD;
      phase of the normal menstrual cycle (luteal phase). This study will investigate possible&#xD;
      hormonal causes of PMS by temporarily stopping the menstrual cycle with leuprolide acetate&#xD;
      and then giving, in sequence, the menstrual cycle hormones progesterone and estrogen. The&#xD;
      results of these hormonal studies will be compared between women with PMS and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers without PMS (see also protocol 92-M-0174).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, participants will undergo a physical examination. Blood, urine, and pregnancy&#xD;
      tests will be performed. Cognitive functioning and stress response will be evaluated during&#xD;
      the study along with brain imaging and genetic studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to accompany Clinical Protocol # 81-M-0126, The Phenomenology and&#xD;
      Biophysiology of Menstrually-Related Mood and Behavioral Disorders. Its original purposes&#xD;
      were as follows: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)&#xD;
      agonist depot leuprolide acetate (Lupron) in the treatment of menstrually-related mood&#xD;
      disorders (MRMD) by determining whether mood and behavioral symptoms are eliminated when the&#xD;
      cyclic secretion of both gonadotropic hormones and gonadal steroids is suppressed, and 2) to&#xD;
      determine the possible relevance of gonadal steroids to affective state by sequentially&#xD;
      replacing estradiol and progesterone during continued GnRH suppression in those patients&#xD;
      whose premenstrual symptoms remit following administration of the GnRH agonist. We observed&#xD;
      that GnRH agonist induced ovarian suppression was an effective treatment compared to placebo&#xD;
      in women with MRMD. Additionally, women with MRMD but not asymptomatic controls&#xD;
      (participating in companion protocol 92-M-0174) experienced a recurrence of mood and&#xD;
      behavioral symptoms when either estradiol or progesterone (but not placebo) was added back.&#xD;
      These data suggest that women with MRMD have a differential sensitivity to the mood&#xD;
      destabilizing effects of gonadal steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having established that women with MRMD show a differential behavioral response to estrogen&#xD;
      and progesterone, we now hope to identify the underlying mechanisms and physiologic&#xD;
      concomitants of the differential behavioral sensitivity by performing studies (described in&#xD;
      companion protocols) under the three hormonal conditions created by this protocol, and&#xD;
      comparing results obtained with those seen in normal controls (Protocol #92-M-0174). Planned&#xD;
      studies include the following: cognitive testing, brain imaging (3D PET, FMRI, MRS) and&#xD;
      genetic studies including induced pluripotent cells.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects of this study will be women who meet the criteria for MRMD as described in&#xD;
        Protocol No. 81-M-0126, 'The Phenomenology and Biophysiology of Menstrually-related Mood&#xD;
        and Behavioral Disorders.' In brief, these criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. history within the last two years of at least six months with menstrually-related mood&#xD;
             or behavioral disturbances of at least moderate severity--i.e., disturbances that are&#xD;
             distinct in appearance and associated with a notable degree of subjective distress;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. symptoms should have a sudden onset and offset;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. age 18-50;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. not pregnant and in good medical health;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. medication free.&#xD;
&#xD;
             All patients participating in this protocol will have already participated in Protocol&#xD;
             No. 81-M-0126 and will have a prospectively confirmed and predictable relationship&#xD;
             between their mood disorder and the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, i.e., a&#xD;
             30% change in severity of symptom self rating scales, relative to the range of the&#xD;
             scale employed, during the seven days premenstrually compared with the seven days&#xD;
             post-menstrually in two out of three months of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia will be administered to all&#xD;
             patients prior to study entry. Any patient with a current axis I psychiatric diagnosis&#xD;
             will be excluded from participating in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior to treatment, a complete physical and neurological examination will have been&#xD;
             performed and the following routine laboratory data obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. Blood&#xD;
&#xD;
             Complete blood count; thyroid function tests; cortisol; renal function tests, such as&#xD;
             BUN and creatinine; electrolytes; glucose; liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
             B. Urine&#xD;
&#xD;
             Routine urinalysis; urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             GnRH agonist will not be administered to any subject with significant clinical or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormalities. The blood tests and urinalysis will be repeated 2 weeks&#xD;
             after GnRH agonist administration to rule out any evidence of acute renal, hepatic or&#xD;
             hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Results of Pap smear performed within one year of the onset of treatment will be&#xD;
             obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
             The following conditions will constitute contraindications to treatment with hormonal&#xD;
             therapy and will preclude a subject's participation in this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  current Axis I psychiatric diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history consistent with endometriosis,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of malignant melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  cholecystitis or pancreatitis,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any woman meeting the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop Criteria (STRAW) for&#xD;
                  the perimenopause. Specifically, we will exclude any woman with an elevated&#xD;
                  plasma FSH level (&gt;= 14 IU/L) and with menstrual cycle variability of &gt; 7 days&#xD;
                  different from their normal cycle length.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects taking birth control pills will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects taking diuretics, prostaglandin inhibitors, or pyridoxine (putative&#xD;
                  treatments for MRMD) will similarly be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients taking psychotropic agents (e.g., lithium carbonate, tricyclic&#xD;
                  antidepressants).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All subjects will be required to use non-hormonal forms of birth control (e.g.,&#xD;
                  barrier methods) to avoid pregnancy during this study.&#xD;
