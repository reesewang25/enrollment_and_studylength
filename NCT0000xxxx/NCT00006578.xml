  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the amount of stem cells (cells that can develop into&#xD;
      many kinds of cells) in the blood before anti-HIV drugs are taken can predict if the immune&#xD;
      system will become stronger after anti-HIV drugs are given and if anti-HIV drugs can restore&#xD;
      stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infection has been shown to cause stem cells not to function well. Granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which causes stem cells to go from the bone marrow&#xD;
      (tissues in the bones where blood cells are formed) into the bloodstream, could possibly help&#xD;
      boost immunity after anti-HIV treatment. This study examines the effects of G-CSF in helping&#xD;
      the immune system become stronger after beginning anti-HIV treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In HIV infection, a progressive decline and/or dysfunction of several cell types is seen. It&#xD;
      is thought that stem cell dysfunction or destruction may contribute to the hematologic and&#xD;
      immunologic perturbations characteristic of HIV infection and may possibly limit the extent&#xD;
      of immunologic recovery following HAART. This study proposes to investigate whether stem cell&#xD;
      function and reserves are important in determining the extent of immune reconstitution&#xD;
      following HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to CD4 count. On Day 0, patients receive a 7-day cycle of&#xD;
      subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Blood samples are collected&#xD;
      regularly, and on Day 14 patients undergo real-time HIV-1 RNA determinations. On Day 28, or&#xD;
      sooner if HIV RNA is at least 1 log above baseline on Day 14, HAART consisting of daily&#xD;
      receipt of abacavir, lamivudine, amprenavir, and ritonavir is initiated and continues until&#xD;
      Week 76. Patients who achieve viral suppression (below 400 copies/ml of plasma HIV-1 RNA) by&#xD;
      Week 26 are eligible to receive a second 7-day cycle of G-CSF at Week 28 and, if viral&#xD;
      suppression continues through Week 50, a third cycle of G-CSF at Week 52. Patients are&#xD;
      followed every 8 weeks for changes in viral load. Additionally, patients are monitored at&#xD;
      regular intervals for surrogate markers of immunologic recovery and, during each cycle of&#xD;
      G-CSF, for measurements of stem cell mobilization. Patients may also volunteer for A5085s&#xD;
      (Bone Marrow Aspirate Substudy) at participating sites.&#xD;
