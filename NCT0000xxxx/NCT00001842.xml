      This study will examine the feasibility of giving cell growth stimulants to granulocyte&#xD;
      donors the same day of donation rather than the day before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who donate granulocytes (infection-fighting white blood cells) for transfusion to&#xD;
      patients with severe white cell deficiencies are often given a steroid called dexamethasone&#xD;
      and a growth factor called G-CSF the day before donation. These drugs stimulate white cell&#xD;
      production, allowing many more cells to be collected than would otherwise be possible. A&#xD;
      single dose of G-CSF given to healthy people increases their white cells counts by four to&#xD;
      five times the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be preferable, however, to give G-CSF the same day of donation, if possible.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will measure white cell counts in healthy people at various intervals&#xD;
      after being injected with G-CSF alone and G-CSF with dexamethasone. The study will compare&#xD;
      the following: granulocyte counts at seven different intervals after injection of the drug or&#xD;
      drugs; the effects of G-CSF injected through a vein or under the skin; and the effects of&#xD;
      giving G-CSF alone or with dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo four procedures, each four weeks apart as follows: donate a&#xD;
      small blood sample; receive an injection of G-CSF under the skin or into a vein; and take&#xD;
      either two dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small blood samples will then be drawn 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the drugs are given.&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about how they feel before the drugs are given and at the&#xD;
      various intervals after taking the drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to increase the white&#xD;
      blood cell count in granulocyte donors prior to donation is becoming an increasingly common&#xD;
      practice. G-CSF is given subcutaneously to the donor on the day prior to donation, generally&#xD;
      12 to 24 hours before the start of apheresis. It would be advantageous to be able to give&#xD;
      G-CSF and collect granulocytes on the same day. However, the single most important factor in&#xD;
      optimizing granulocyte collection is the donor's pre-collection granulocyte count. Therefore,&#xD;
      any decrease in count would result in a less cellular component. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess granulocyte counts in healthy subjects during an 8-hour period after a single 5&#xD;
      microgram/kg intravenous dose of G-CSF with or without dexamethasone. Sixteen subjects will&#xD;
      be studied. Each donor will be studied four separate times. The four mobilization protocols&#xD;
      to be studied are G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg given intravenously, G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg&#xD;
      subcutaneously, G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg intravenously plus dexamethasone 8 mg orally, and G-CSF&#xD;
      5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously plus dexamethasone 8 mg orally. The order of the route of&#xD;
      administration will be assigned randomly. White blood cell counts, neutrophil counts and&#xD;
      donor symptoms will be measured before G-CSF administration and at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24&#xD;
      hours after administration. The neutrophil counts measured within the first 8 hours after&#xD;
      G-CSF will be compared with counts measured 24 hours after G-CSF.&#xD;
