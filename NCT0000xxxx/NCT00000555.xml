  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether hormonal replacement therapy and/or antioxidant treatment would stabilize&#xD;
      or inhibit progression, and induce regression of coronary plaques. The mechanisms by which&#xD;
      these treatments modified atherosclerosis in women were also explored.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for&#xD;
      over 500,000 deaths each year. Although the onset of coronary artery disease is delayed in&#xD;
      women, it is the single most important cause of death in women over the entire life span.&#xD;
      Indeed, because more women than men survive to old age, mortality due to coronary artery&#xD;
      disease for all ages combined is as great in women as in men. Furthermore, once they present&#xD;
      with clinical evidence of coronary artery disease, women have a prognosis as poor as, or even&#xD;
      worse, than that for men. In part, this may be due to late recognition of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease in women, less intensive treatment of women, or a more adverse risk profile in women&#xD;
      who develop coronary artery disease. The report of a recent Working Group on Angiographic&#xD;
      Trials of Atherosclerosis Prevention notes that, compared to males, females who develop&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, have various different characteristics which may affect the vascular&#xD;
      response to lipid-altering interventions. These differences led the report to question&#xD;
      whether the mechanisms and clinical benefits of lipid-altering agents may be different in men&#xD;
      and women. It further noted that angiographic trials conducted to date have been based&#xD;
      primarily upon the cholesterol-lowering treatments of diet or drugs and suggested that other&#xD;
      approaches based upon the lipid hypothesis could profitably be tested and should be given the&#xD;
      highest priority at this time; specifically recommended were trials of hormone replacement&#xD;
      and antioxidant therapy in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized into a 2 x 2 factorial trial of hormone replacement therapy and&#xD;
      antioxidant therapy. Women were randomized into four treatment groups: both active hormone&#xD;
      replacement and antioxidant; active hormone replacement therapy and antioxidant placebo;&#xD;
      active antioxidant therapy and hormone replacement placebo; double placebo plus usual care.&#xD;
      Hormone replacement therapy consisted of estrogen plus a progestin (PremPro) for all&#xD;
      gynecologically intact women, and unopposed estrogen (Premarin) for women with&#xD;
      hysterectomies. Antioxidants consisted of a combination of vitamin E and vitamin C.&#xD;
      Angiographic change was a primary endpoint of this trial. The study was double-blind to the&#xD;
      extent permitted by the interventions; however, it was fully-blinded with respect to outcome&#xD;
      variables. Recruitment ended in August 1999. The mean duration of follow-up was approximately&#xD;
      three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NHLBI awarded R01HL68397 in April 2001 as an ancillary study to WAVE. The study entitled&#xD;
      &quot;Modifying Oxidative Damage in WAVE&quot; has its on site on this database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
