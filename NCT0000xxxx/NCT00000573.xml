      To determine if enteral nutrition support (ENS) restores normal body weight and improves&#xD;
      muscle strength, exercise performance, sensation of dyspnea, and quality of life in&#xD;
      malnourished patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major health problem and a leading cause for&#xD;
      hospital admission in the United States. A severe form of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease that is accompanied by weight loss is commonly referred to as pulmonary cachexia.&#xD;
      Studies in the 1960s demonstrated associations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      patients between weight loss, low FEV1, and early mortality. This observation was&#xD;
      strengthened by a retrospective analysis of the Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing&#xD;
      Trial data that suggested malnutrition was an independent predictor of outcome in men with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The underlying basis relating malnutrition to adverse&#xD;
      outcome in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was unknown, although there was a large body&#xD;
      of information indicating that pulmonary cachexia was associated with respiratory muscle&#xD;
      atrophy, myofibrillar substrate depletion, and impaired skeletal and respiratory muscle&#xD;
      function. The primary question was whether the nutrition-related functional deficits observed&#xD;
      in underweight patients could be reversed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three years of the study supported a pilot project of oral nutrition therapy in&#xD;
      malnourished chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects underwent intubation during the initial testing interval and subsequently&#xD;
      underwent dietary counseling and oral nutritional supplement during a two-month stabilization&#xD;
      phase. Subjects who demonstrated adequate weight gain defined as achievement of more than 90&#xD;
      percent of ideal body weight or who were unable to tolerate intubation were eliminated from&#xD;
      further investigation. Eligible subjects were randomized to either ENS or to dietary&#xD;
      counseling only. Subjects randomized to ENS received enteral supplementation with Osmolite&#xD;
      delivered by continuous infusion pump. Feedings were continuous or nocturnal for sixteen&#xD;
      weeks in order to deliver a caloric intake of 1.7 times the resting energy value. Following&#xD;
      the intervention phase, all subjects were maintained on dietary counseling on a monthly basis&#xD;
      with oral nutritional supplements. Outcome variables were measured before and after the&#xD;
      stabilization phase, at eight and sixteen weeks during the intervention phase, and at eight&#xD;
      and sixteen weeks during the post-intervention phase. The primary outcome variable was muscle&#xD;
      strength and its effect on exercise performance, dyspnea, and quality of life. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome variables included morbidity and mortality. The grant was extended through November&#xD;
      1995 for data analysis.&#xD;
