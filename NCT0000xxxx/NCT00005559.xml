      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once considered to be a rare disorder, hemochromatosis is now recognized to be one of the&#xD;
      most common autosomal recessive disorders in white populations. Substantial morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality may result from untreated hemochromatosis; thus, early detection and treatment are&#xD;
      essential. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the College of American&#xD;
      Pathologists now recommend regular screening for hereditary hemochromatosis. Transferrin&#xD;
      saturation is regarded as the best single screening test for the detection of individuals at&#xD;
      risk for the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical mixture modeling was used to develop guidelines for hemochromatosis screening&#xD;
      regimes and to determine the frequency of the gene for hemochromatosis. The research was&#xD;
      designed to provide a statistical foundation for the analysis of population transferrin&#xD;
      saturations to assist in development of optimal screening regimens for hemochromatosis. To&#xD;
      determine potential screening thresholds, probability methods were applied to data from the&#xD;
      third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a cross-sectional&#xD;
      probability sample weighted to represent the U.S. population. Statistical mixture modeling&#xD;
      was used to determine potential transferrin saturation screening thresholds to identify&#xD;
      individuals for repeat testing and possible further evaluation. The actual sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of these screening thresholds was then assessed using data from a separate&#xD;
      demonstration project, &quot;Cost effective Hemochromatosis Survey in Primary Care&quot;, designed to&#xD;
      identify individuals with hemochromatosis. In addition, the gene frequency for&#xD;
      hemochromatosis for whites and ethnic subgroups was also determined by analysis of&#xD;
      transferrin saturation data from NHANES III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two specific aims, as follow: (1) to develop guidelines for the use of&#xD;
      transferrin saturation and related tests in detection of individuals at risk for&#xD;
      hemochromatosis, and (2) to determine the frequency of the gene for hemochromatosis in the&#xD;
      United States by statistical mixture modeling of population transferrin saturation data from&#xD;
      NHANES III. Providing the statistical foundation for the analysis of transferrin saturations&#xD;
      should facilitate development of optimal, cost-effective screening regimens for&#xD;
      identification of individuals requiring further evaluation for hemochromatosis.&#xD;
