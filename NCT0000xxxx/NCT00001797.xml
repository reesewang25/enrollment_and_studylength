  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have documented an essential role for interleukin-10 (IL-10) in preventing&#xD;
      prolonged and exaggerated immune responses to antigens and irritants. Psoriasis, a relatively&#xD;
      common disease, is characterized by T cell-mediated inflammation in affected skin. In this&#xD;
      study, the safety, tolerance, immunologic effects, and clinical activity of subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      recombinant human (rh) IL-10 will be evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.&#xD;
      There will be 2 groups of patients, randomized to receive either 20 ug/kg rhIL-10 SC 3 times&#xD;
      weekly (20 patients) or SC placebo (10 patients). This double-blind phase will continue for a&#xD;
      total of 12 weeks and the principal evaluation will be the comparison between baseline and 12&#xD;
      week Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores. Patients will come for an initial screening&#xD;
      visit at day 0, and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12, with follow-up visits at weeks 16 and 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be offered rhIL-10 at 12 weeks (following the blinded portion of the study&#xD;
      protocol). Patients initially receiving active medication who wish to continue rhIL-10&#xD;
      therapy will be kept on the drug. This open-label portion of the study will continue for an&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks. Patients continuing with active drug will be evaluated at weeks 14, 16,&#xD;
      20, and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin disease activity and toxicity will be assessed and recorded throughout the study. In&#xD;
      addition, research studies will include functional assays to assess cytokine secretion and&#xD;
      immunologic function of peripheral blood cells and immunohistochemical characterization of&#xD;
      the inflammatory cells in skin.&#xD;

        equal to 28% or platelet counts less than 100,000/ml], neurologic, renal, or pulmonary&#xD;
        disease).&#xD;
