  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that isometric strengthening helps people with osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
      Isometric strengthening is muscle-strengthening exercise without movement, in which a person&#xD;
      applies a force against a resistant object--for example, pushing against a brick wall. This&#xD;
      study will test the effectiveness of a portable isometric exercise device for home use that&#xD;
      guides a person through an exercise program using various forms of feedback. We will look at&#xD;
      whether people exercising with the device achieve better outcomes (results) in pain,&#xD;
      stiffness, strength, and functional measures compared to people who do not use the device or&#xD;
      people exercising according to printed material from arthritis organizations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that isometric strengthening is beneficial in managing&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee. This type of exercise can decrease joint-related pain and&#xD;
      stiffness while increasing strength and functional measures. However, individuals rarely&#xD;
      adhere to isometric exercise for any lengthy period of time because there has not been a way&#xD;
      to measure applied force and performance over time in the home setting. In addition, this&#xD;
      type of exercise has often been described as &quot;boring.&quot; We believe that being able to monitor&#xD;
      one's progress is essential in maintaining adherence to an isometric exercise program. This&#xD;
      study will examine the effectiveness of a portable isometric exercise device for home use&#xD;
      that guides the user through an exercise protocol by means of various forms of feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that individuals exercising with the device will achieve better outcomes in&#xD;
      pain, stiffness, strength, and functional measures than a control group or a group exercising&#xD;
      according to printed material from arthritis advocacy groups. We will randomly assign study&#xD;
      participants meeting eligibility criteria to the exercise device group, exercise according to&#xD;
      printed material group, or control group. We will conduct measures in all groups during a&#xD;
      clinic visit at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. As subjects in the exercise device group&#xD;
      strengthen their leg muscles, a physical therapist will likely need to adjust upward the&#xD;
      target force for different leg positions during every clinic visit, 2 weeks apart.&#xD;
