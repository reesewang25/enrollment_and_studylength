      To determine the relative risk in a defined population of angiographically demonstrated&#xD;
      coronary artery disease due to genetic polymorphisms at the four apolipoprotein genomic&#xD;
      regions.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of coronary heart disease is&#xD;
      strongly influenced by plasma lipid levels, especially HDL and LDL cholesterol, and their&#xD;
      specific apolipoprotein constituents. Genetic studies have established significant&#xD;
      heritability of these lipid components, and have also identified relatively rare major genes&#xD;
      that result in extreme lipid values and increased risk of coronary heart disease. Geneticists&#xD;
      have identified a number of segregating polymorphisms at the four major apolipoprotein&#xD;
      genomic regions, using a combination of protein and DNA assays. However, in 1988 when the&#xD;
      study was initiated, the relationship between these polymorphisms and risk of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease had not yet been properly defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had a case-control design. Cases were consecutively selected from the pool of&#xD;
      eligible Latter Day Saints Hospital patients referred for coronary angiogram. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria included residing in the Wasatch County or Southern Idaho counties, being healthy at&#xD;
      the time of angiogram and having greater than 60 percent occlusion. Approximately 80-100&#xD;
      controls were retrospectively selected from the clinic records of the past four years.&#xD;
      Fasting lipid profiles were defined for cases and controls in terms of total cholesterol,&#xD;
      total triglycerides, HDL levels, LDL levels, VLDL levels, density gradient distribution of&#xD;
      HDL-LDL subfractions, and levels of apo A-1, apo B, and apo E. The distribution of genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms at the four major apolipoprotein genomic regions was determined by typing all&#xD;
      cases and controls for isoforms of apo E and apo AIV and a wide variety of DNA polymorphisms.&#xD;
      Approximately 800 first degree relatives of cases and controls were also typed for DNA&#xD;
      polymorphisms. Data were collected on risk factors including smoking, alcohol use, obesity,&#xD;
      physical activity, and diet. Clinical data included medical and family history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and medication status. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to&#xD;
      define the relative risk of coronary disease associated with segregating polymorphisms, and&#xD;
      DNA haplotypes at these loci in conjunction with lipid profiles and risk factors. Analyses&#xD;
      were also conducted on the extent to which the genetic segregation at these apolipoprotein&#xD;
      genomic regions influenced the distribution of lipid profiles and whether the distribution of&#xD;
      risk factors was influenced by the interaction of environmental risk factors such as smoking&#xD;
      and genotypes at these regions.&#xD;
