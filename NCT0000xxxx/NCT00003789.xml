    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of hyperthermic isolated limb&#xD;
      perfusion of melphalan with or without tumor necrosis factor in treating patients who have&#xD;
      locally advanced melanoma of the arm or leg. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to&#xD;
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Heating melphalan to several&#xD;
      degrees above body temperature and infusing it only to the area around the tumor may kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combining melphalan with tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      is more effective than melphalan alone in treating melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with melphalan with or without tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor, in terms of response proportion for lesions in the perfusion field, in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced extremity melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the local recurrence-free survival, improvement in regional symptoms related to&#xD;
      tumor, and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor&#xD;
      burden (high vs low), prior reperfusion (melphalan vs other), regional nodal site (yes vs&#xD;
      no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated perfusions of the lower limb by either the&#xD;
      external iliac vessels or the common femoral vessels. Patients undergo perfusions of the&#xD;
      upper extremity by the axillary artery and vein using an infraclavicular/axillary incision.&#xD;
      Melphalan is introduced into the perfusion by slow injection over 5 minutes and allowed to&#xD;
      remain for a total of 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated perfusions as in arm I. Tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      is administered by slow injection into the arterial line and allowed to remain for a total of&#xD;
      90 minutes. Melphalan is introduced into the perfusion as in arm I and allowed to remain for&#xD;
      a total of 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed within 6 weeks, at 3, 6, and 12 months, every 6 months for 4 years, and&#xD;
      then annually thereafter.&#xD;
