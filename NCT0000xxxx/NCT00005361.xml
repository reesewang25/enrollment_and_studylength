      To measure lung function and respiratory symptom status in a large cohort of healthy,&#xD;
      non-smoking 18-22 year old subjects, and relate these measurements to past histories of&#xD;
      passive smoke and air pollution exposures.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the natural history of human lung function growth and decline has been studied&#xD;
      intensively over the past 30 years, relatively few data have been collected during the period&#xD;
      in which peak volumetric function is achieved, i.e., around the age of 20. As a result, very&#xD;
      little is known about the factors, both demographic and environmental, which influence&#xD;
      maximal attained lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal study collected information on the history of respiratory illness,&#xD;
      residential history, parental smoking, socio-economic status and home characteristics via an&#xD;
      initial questionnaire administered to cadets enrolling at West Point. A sequence of four&#xD;
      annual measurements of lung function (by spirometry), and prior-year respiratory health&#xD;
      status and activity patterns was obtained in the spring of each year. Pollution exposures&#xD;
      were estimated by matching residential histories with historical pollution data stored at the&#xD;
      Environmental Protection Agency. Data on meteorological variables (temperature, relative&#xD;
      humidity, wind speed) and altitude were obtained for each residential location. The four&#xD;
      annual lung function measurements provided precise estimates of individual mean levels of&#xD;
      FVC, FEV1, FEF25-75, PEFR, and flow rates at 50 percent and 75 percent of expired FVC.&#xD;
      Subject-specific lung function level was analyzed in relation to history of parental smoking&#xD;
      and prior exposure to air pollution using analysis of variance methods, controlling for&#xD;
      potential confounding variables. In addition to testing these hypotheses regarding the&#xD;
      respiratory effects of passive smoking and air pollution exposure, the study also explored&#xD;
      the effects of these exposures on the change in lung function between the ages of 18 and 22&#xD;
      and on respiratory illness and symptom experience while at West Point. Finally, the study&#xD;
      established a cohort which could be followed in future years.&#xD;
