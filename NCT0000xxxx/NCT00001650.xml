  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how quickly white blood cells called CD4 lymphocytes reproduce and&#xD;
      how long they live in people infected with HIV. It will do this using bromodeoxyuridine&#xD;
      (BrDU), a compound that is structurally similar to thymidine, one of the building blocks of&#xD;
      DNA. BrDU gets incorporated into DNA instead of thymidine, but it can only get into cells&#xD;
      that are replicating. Therefore, measuring the proportion of cells with BrDU indicates how&#xD;
      many cells are replicating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (EKG) and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given an infusion of BrDU through a catheter (thin plastic tube) placed&#xD;
      in an arm vein. Blood will be drawn up to 4 times in the first 24 hours after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional samples will then be collected as often as daily for the first week, twice a week&#xD;
      for the next 3 weeks and then weekly to monthly for up to 1 year. Some patients may undergo a&#xD;
      tissue biopsy (removal of a small tissue sample from a lymph node, tonsil or colon) or&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scans of the thymus (a small gland between the lungs that&#xD;
      manufactures lymphocytes. Some patients will have a second infusion in order to examine&#xD;
      changes in the rate of CD4 replication over time or following potent antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed in the clinic periodically for the first year and then will be seen&#xD;
      in the clinic or contacted by telephone once a year for 4 more years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study may provide a better understanding of how HIV causes disease and&#xD;
      how therapy affects the immune system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding the rate of lymphocyte replication and destruction in HIV infected patients, as&#xD;
      well as the effects of therapy on lymphocyte replication should lead to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms behind the immunodeficiency induced by HIV. To examine this&#xD;
      directly, up to 85 HIV-infected patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will receive&#xD;
      up to two 30 minute infusions (at least one month apart) of bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU; 200&#xD;
      mg/m(2)), an analogue of thymidine. BrDU is incorporated into DNA and can be measured using&#xD;
      an anti-BrDU monoclonal antibody. It can be measured in subpopulations of cells to determine&#xD;
      the rate of replication of those cells. All participants in this study will be reimbursed for&#xD;
      the inconvenience and discomfort associated with study participation.&#xD;
