  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A layer of cells called the endothelium line the walls of blood vessels. These cells produce&#xD;
      substances that control the tone of blood vessels and thus control blood flow through the&#xD;
      vessel. One of the substances produced involved in the control of blood vessel function is&#xD;
      nitric oxide. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in the relaxation of blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have been interested in the function of the endothelium in patients with high&#xD;
      blood pressure (essential hypertension) and patients with high cholesterol&#xD;
      (hypercholesterolemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After conducting studies on the endothelium and nitric oxide, researchers have found that the&#xD;
      endothelium is indeed functioning abnormally in patients with high blood pressure and high&#xD;
      cholesterol. In addition, researchers have determined that the dysfunction is a result of&#xD;
      abnormalities in the nitric oxide (NO) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers plan to investigate the relationship between blood vessel responses&#xD;
      in real-life settings versus laboratory settings in normal volunteers, patients with high&#xD;
      blood pressure, and patients with high cholesterol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last ten years, we have been interested in the investigation of endothelial function&#xD;
      in patients with essential hypertension and patients with hypercholesterolemia. We have&#xD;
      performed intra-arterial infusion of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent drugs&#xD;
      into the brachial artery with noninvasive measurement of the response of the forearm&#xD;
      vasculature by means of strain gauge plethysmography. Those studies have allowed us to: a)&#xD;
      demonstrate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with essential hypertension&#xD;
      and in patients with hypercholesterolemia; and b) identify an abnormality in the&#xD;
      endothelium-derived nitric oxide system that is responsible for endothelial dysfunction in&#xD;
      these patients. Further studies to more precisely determine the intracellular processes that&#xD;
      mediate this abnormality in endothelial function in these patients are limited by the&#xD;
      inherent shortcomings of the in vivo technique. An alternative possibility is the study of&#xD;
      human small vessels in vitro; however, the relationship between in vivo and in vitro vascular&#xD;
      responses to endothelium-dependent and -independent agonists has not been established. In the&#xD;
      present study, we propose to investigate this relationship in normal volunteers, patients&#xD;
      with essential hypertension, and patients with hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Patients (men and nonpregnant women) with systemic hypertension, patients with&#xD;
        hypercholesterolemia, and normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All blood pressure recordings must be consistently elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No renovascular hypertension or other etiologies for elevated blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No definite evidence of accelerated or malignant hypertension (diastolic pressures above&#xD;
        115 mmHg, with associated encephalopathic changes, papilledema, progressive renal failure,&#xD;
        or congestive heart failure), or serious intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in whom withdrawal of antihypertensive medications is considered hazardous are&#xD;
        ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in whom the blood pressure remains at normal levels 2 weeks after withdrawal of&#xD;
        antihypertensive treatment will be closely monitored until they become hypertensive, at&#xD;
        which time they will undergo the study. Patients in whom blood pressure does not increase&#xD;
        after 2 months of discontinuation of therapy will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with coexistent hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers who are not taking any kind of medication are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coagulopathy, or any other disease&#xD;
        predisposing to vasculitis or Raynaud's phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of keloid formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must be capable of giving informed consent for all procedures.&#xD;
