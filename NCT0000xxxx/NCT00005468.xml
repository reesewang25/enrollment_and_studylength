      To investigate the variability of lipids and specifically the effects of stress on serum&#xD;
      triglyceride levels, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL in a 2.5 year epidemiological study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While researchers had documented some of the behavioral contributors to fluctuation in&#xD;
      individuals' lipid levels (e.g., nutrition patterns, smoking, exercise), little attention had&#xD;
      been given to psychosocial stress. Early reports utilizing accountants, race car drivers, and&#xD;
      air traffic controllers provided some uncontrolled data associating stress with cholesterol&#xD;
      increases. Yet, no empirical research on stress that concomitantly examined other related&#xD;
      influences was available. This paucity of data was probably due to lack of objective measures&#xD;
      of stress and difficulty in measuring lipid subfractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of their pilot study, and their research observations, the investigators&#xD;
      predicted significant positive associations between stress level and triglycerides. A total&#xD;
      of 228 public accountants (148 men and 80 women to provide comparable power between the&#xD;
      sexes) were recruited from the greater Birmingham, Alabama area. Participants were evaluated&#xD;
      monthly for 18 months, across three stressful and non-stressful work intervals (i.e., tax&#xD;
      seasons). The investigators also collected data (during this same time frame) to closely&#xD;
      monitor the following variables that affect lipids: dietary intake (including alcohol,&#xD;
      caffeine, total calories, total fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol), smoking, and&#xD;
      physical activity, and oral contraceptive use, pregnancy status and menstrual stage among the&#xD;
      women. Additionally, a substudy presented a unique opportunity for them to investigate the&#xD;
      relation between stress and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the formation of foam cells.&#xD;
