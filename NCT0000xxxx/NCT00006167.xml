      There are no guidelines for appropriate nutritional management of weight loss or wasting in&#xD;
      HIV infection. Some treatments may increase weight, but without improving muscle mass or&#xD;
      quality of life. In this clinical trial AIDS patients with wasting are randomized to one of&#xD;
      three nutritional strategies and studied over a 12-week period: 1) optimal oral nutrition&#xD;
      with counseling and protein and calorie supplementation, and a placebo pill; 2) optimal oral&#xD;
      nutrition with the oral androgen, oxandrolone at 20 mg daily; and 3) optimal oral nutrition&#xD;
      with progressive resistance training (PRT). In all participants, dietary intervention is&#xD;
      maximized by weekly personalized counseling to address individual issues and concerns. Two&#xD;
      primary outcomes are assessed: thigh muscle mass and quality of life. Our findings can be&#xD;
      used to develop guidelines for standards of nutritional care among AIDS patient with the&#xD;
      wasting syndrome.&#xD;
