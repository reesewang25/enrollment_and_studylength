  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the nervous system. The exact cause of MS is unknown,&#xD;
      but it is believed to be an autoimmune condition. Autoimmune conditions are diseases that&#xD;
      cause the body's immune system and natural defenses to attack healthy cells. In the case of&#xD;
      MS, the immune system begins attacking myelin, the cells that make up the sheath covering&#xD;
      nerves. Without myelin, nerves are unable to transmit signals effectively and symptoms occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is directed toward a better understanding of the cause of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
      Researchers will evaluate patients with a tentative diagnosis of MS or other neurological&#xD;
      diseases possibly caused by a immunological reaction. Patients will undergo a series of three&#xD;
      MRIs, taken once a month for three months and submit blood samples for immunological studies.&#xD;

      The Neuroimmunology Branch (NIB) conducts research into the cause of immunologically mediated&#xD;
      diseases of the nervous system such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The studies in the NIB range&#xD;
      for studies of the natural history of MS to trials of new experimental therapies. In order to&#xD;
      recruit patients into the various NIB research studies, patients with a tentative diagnosis&#xD;
      are initially seen by the NIB to assess the accuracy of the diagnosis and to assess the level&#xD;
      of disease activity occurring in the patient. Patients seen under the NIB screening protocol&#xD;
      are evaluated in clinic with a complete neurological examination. Blood studies necessary to&#xD;
      eliminate the possibility of many other causes of disease that may resemble MS are performed.&#xD;
      Spinal fluid examination may be preformed if uncertainty exists with respect to the&#xD;
      diagnosis. Finally, patients will have at least one MRI preformed to assess the consistency&#xD;
      with MRI findings expected in MS. Most patients will have a series of three MRIs done&#xD;
      approximately one month apart in order to assess the frequency of new contrast enhancing&#xD;
      lesions occurring in the patient. The level of disease on MRI is important both from the&#xD;
      standpoint of diagnosis as well as determining if the patient may be eligible for any other&#xD;
      NIB protocols. To assess the patient's eligibility for other NIB studies, the NIB may&#xD;
      periodically follow patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain or in whom the level of&#xD;
      disease activity is not clear for the initial evaluation.&#xD;
