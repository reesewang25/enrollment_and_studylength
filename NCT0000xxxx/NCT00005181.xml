      To correlate dietary factors and changes in pressor substances, including aldosterone and&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure increases with age, and over time, reaches proportions consistent with&#xD;
      clinically defined hypertension in some individuals. The age-dependent increase in blood&#xD;
      pressure starts in mid-childhood and accelerates during puberty and in the post-pubertal&#xD;
      period. Thus, mechanisms for the development of hypertension are likely present at an early&#xD;
      age. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored the 'Workshop on Juvenile&#xD;
      Hypertension' in May 1983. The Workshop conclusions were that although a great deal had been&#xD;
      accomplished in the past decade, research in juvenile hypertension had slowed and little&#xD;
      effort was evident in some important areas of the field. They noted especially the paucity of&#xD;
      effort in research relating to mechanisms of blood pressure regulation and elevation, to&#xD;
      clinical management of the hypertensive state, and to identification of the prehypertensive&#xD;
      state. Based on the recommendations of the Workshop, this study was initiated in response to&#xD;
      a Request for Applications on 'Juvenile Hypertension and the Prehypertensive State' released&#xD;
      by the NHLBI in October 1984.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Production of aldosterone and norepinephrine is examined in a mixed-longitudinal study design&#xD;
      in white and Black boys and girls beginning at ages 6 to 12 and extending to age 17. Levels&#xD;
      of these pressor systems are determined in the basal state from measurements made in urine&#xD;
      samples collected overnight. To enhance the likelihood that school children would comply with&#xD;
      the multiple observations required for this longitudinal study, measurements are deliberately&#xD;
      restricted to non-invasive ones. Specifically, aldosterone and norepinephrine excretion&#xD;
      measured in sleep urine are obtained at six month intervals in addition to blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, weight, height, and skin-fold thickness. Family history of hypertension and&#xD;
      parental blood pressures are used as covariates in analysis of data in children. A second&#xD;
      part of the study concerns the observation that blood pressure increases at a faster rate&#xD;
      during adrenarche, a period of increasing adrenal androgen production, and during puberty.&#xD;
      Androgen production during periods of adrenal and gonadal maturation may contribute to the&#xD;
      increase in blood pressure. The relationship of androgen to blood pressure is examined by&#xD;
      distinguishing blood pressure responses to androgen production from effects of androgens on&#xD;
      physical growth, thus exploring the concept that androgens interact directly with pressor&#xD;
      systems to raise blood pressure. Androgen production during the adrenarche is determined by&#xD;
      measurement of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate excretion, and during puberty by measurement of&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone excretion in sleep urine samples. Studies continue on the relationship&#xD;
      between aldosterone excretion rate, dietary potassium intake, and blood pressure. A&#xD;
      cross-over study is conducted to examine the effect of potassium supplementation on&#xD;
      aldosterone production. Segregation analysis of the 'low-aldosterone'phenotype is performed&#xD;
      on family members of children with low-aldosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 1996 to continue the longitudinal study of children (a biracial&#xD;
      population, ages 6-16 years) for whom influences of hormones on blood pressure are being&#xD;
      examined. Twice yearly the children have had blood pressure and anthropometrics measured, and&#xD;
      overnight urine samples collected for measurement of aldosterone, adrenal androgens (AA),&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH), sodium, potassium, and creatinine. Rates of growth and the changes&#xD;
      in blood pressure with age have been well characterized for this population. From the&#xD;
      original observations, several differences were observed between racial groups; specifically,&#xD;
      Black children were found to consume less potassium, produce about 40 percent less&#xD;
      aldosterone and have higher blood pressures than white children. It was observed that&#xD;
      children with positive families histories of hypertension were more likely to have lower&#xD;
      aldosterone-excretion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the proposed continuation of longitudinal studies, the hypothesis is tested that&#xD;
      children with low-aldosterone levels are predisposed to higher blood pressures. Although&#xD;
      Black children had lower potassium intakes, cross-sectional data indicated that only part of&#xD;
      the racial difference in aldosterone production was secondary to a lower intake of potassium&#xD;
      (potassium is a known stimulus of aldosterone production). Subjects with known&#xD;
      low-aldosterone production (Blacks and whites) have diets supplemented with potassium to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that Blacks with low-aldosterone production have a reduced responsiveness to&#xD;
      potassium when compared to white children with low-aldosterone. Families of children with&#xD;
      potassium-resistant low-aldosterone production are screened for evidence of low-aldosterone&#xD;
      production, and segregation analyses is performed to establish the mode of inheritance of the&#xD;
      'low-aldosterone' phenotype. In cross-sectional studies, AA-excretion rates were positively&#xD;
      related to blood pressure in subjects greater than or equal to 10 years of age, suggesting an&#xD;
      important role for the adrenarche in determining blood pressure levels in young people. In&#xD;
      future longitudinal studies the role of AA as well as gonadal hormones will be studied as&#xD;
      more children reach adolescence (the current mean age of the cohort is 12.7 yr). In addition,&#xD;
      to better distinguish the individual influences of adrenarche, gonadarche, and increases in&#xD;
      body size on blood pressure, a series of patients where these phenomenon are dissociated will&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in FY 2002 to identify new mechanisms for hypertension using a strategy&#xD;
      which identifies the sodium transporters in kidney that account for why blacks retain more&#xD;
      sodium than whites. Three sites along the nephron will be studied based on compelling&#xD;
      evidence that they are linked to the increased sodium-retention in blacks.&#xD;
