  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the safety and tolerance of three different doses of recombinant human interleukin 2&#xD;
      (aldesleukin; IL-2), when it is given for five consecutive days to patients with AIDS or AIDS&#xD;
      related complex (ARC), who have also received zidovudine (AZT) for at least 6 weeks just&#xD;
      before beginning the IL-2 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZT is an antiviral drug, which has been shown to be beneficial in some patients with AIDS.&#xD;
      IL-2 is a substance found naturally in the body that boosts the body's immune response to&#xD;
      invading organisms and tumor cells. These two drugs, when administered together, may have a&#xD;
      mutually helpful effect in treating AIDS patients, but before this effect can be studied, it&#xD;
      is important to understand the proper dose and any side effects that may occur when these&#xD;
      drugs are used together. The study will show how much AZT and IL-2 patients can safely take&#xD;
      at the same time and how the two drugs will interact with each other.&#xD;

      AZT is an antiviral drug, which has been shown to be beneficial in some patients with AIDS.&#xD;
      IL-2 is a substance found naturally in the body that boosts the body's immune response to&#xD;
      invading organisms and tumor cells. These two drugs, when administered together, may have a&#xD;
      mutually helpful effect in treating AIDS patients, but before this effect can be studied, it&#xD;
      is important to understand the proper dose and any side effects that may occur when these&#xD;
      drugs are used together. The study will show how much AZT and IL-2 patients can safely take&#xD;
      at the same time and how the two drugs will interact with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: Note that the dose of AZT changed 900214 to reflect new dose recommendations.&#xD;
      Original design: Six weeks before beginning treatment with IL-2, patients are given AZT&#xD;
      daily. There are three patient groups, one for each dose level of IL-2. On the first day of&#xD;
      treatment with the two drugs together, patients are admitted to Presbyterian University&#xD;
      Hospital, where AZT is administered orally every 4 hours and IL-2 is given once a day as a&#xD;
      single injection under the skin. Clinical and laboratory safety data from the first two&#xD;
      patients enrolled in each treatment group will be analyzed prior to enrolling additional&#xD;
      patients in each group. All patients are expected to stay in the hospital for at least 5&#xD;
      days, and some may stay longer if serious side effects develop. AZT treatment will continue&#xD;
      after the patient leaves the hospital for an additional 10 weeks. Follow-up visits are&#xD;
      scheduled for days 6, 8, and 15 for safety, immunologic, and virologic evaluations.&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients are followed by telephone interview every other week and come into the&#xD;
      clinic if a change in health is reported. At weeks 10 and 20, patients are also evaluated in&#xD;
      a follow-up clinic visit.&#xD;
