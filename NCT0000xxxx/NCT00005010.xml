      The purpose of this study is to see how effective 2 drugs, irbesartan and pravastatin, are at&#xD;
      slowing kidney transplant failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many kidney transplant patients have some type of chronic rejection. Chronic rejection is a&#xD;
      disease that causes scarring and damage to the kidney. Over time, chronic rejection can lead&#xD;
      to kidney failure, making it necessary for patients to start dialysis and possibly receive&#xD;
      another kidney transplant. Doctors would like to see whether irbesartan and pravastatin can&#xD;
      slow this damage and prevent kidney failure in patients with signs of chronic rejection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal graft failure due to chronic rejection, also known as chronic allograft nephropathy, is&#xD;
      one of the leading causes for repeat renal transplantation. Chronic rejection is&#xD;
      characterized by progressive fibrosis and scarring. Renal biopsies of patients undergoing&#xD;
      chronic rejection show greater expression of profibrotic cytokines, including TGF-beta and&#xD;
      PDGF, than normal kidney tissue. Moreover, the cytokine activity of chronic rejection&#xD;
      resembles that of other fibrosing renal diseases. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors&#xD;
      (ACEinh) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to protect effectively against&#xD;
      other types of fibrotic disease. These drugs may protect against fibrosis and preserve renal&#xD;
      function in renal transplant patients with chronic rejection, in part by blocking activation&#xD;
      of TGF-beta and PDGF. This study evaluates the impact of irbesartan (an AII-RB which acts&#xD;
      similar to an ACEinh) and pravastatin on the clinical progression of chronic rejection and on&#xD;
      the expression of TGF-beta, PDGF, and connective tissue genes in the chronically rejecting&#xD;
      kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to intervention, patients undergo a transplant renal biopsy to: 1) confirm the presence&#xD;
      of chronic renal allograft nephropathy and 2) quantify baseline mRNA levels for TGF-beta,&#xD;
      PDGF, and selected cytokines and connective tissue components. Patients are randomized to 4&#xD;
      arms: Group 1 receives pravastatin placebo plus irbesartan placebo; Group 2 receives&#xD;
      pravastatin plus irbesartan placebo; Group 3 receives pravastatin placebo plus irbesartan;&#xD;
      and Group 4 receives pravastatin plus irbesartan. Pravastatin is administered at a dose of 20&#xD;
      mg/day. Irbesartan is initiated at 150 mg/day and is titred to 300 mg/day after 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated routinely for serum creatinine and potassium levels, blood pressure,&#xD;
      and other markers of kidney function. In addition, they are monitored for toxicities and&#xD;
      adverse events, particularly an early rise in serum creatinine or muscle enzyme changes. At&#xD;
      Month 6, or when serum creatinine has risen above 5.0 mg/dl if that is earlier, a repeat&#xD;
      transplant kidney biopsy is obtained to compare to baseline. Changes in chronic allograft&#xD;
      nephropathy and cytokine mRNA levels are evaluated to determine any correlation between&#xD;
      clinical effect and changes in activity of profibrotic pathways. Study endpoints are death or&#xD;
      renal failure manifested by initiation of dialysis or retransplantation.&#xD;
