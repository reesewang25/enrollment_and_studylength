  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a variety of tumors affecting the pituitary gland in childhood; some of these tumors&#xD;
      (eg craniopharyngioma) are included among the most common central nervous system tumors in&#xD;
      childhood. The gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors are largely not known;&#xD;
      their possible association with other developmental defects or inheritance pattern(s) has not&#xD;
      been investigated. The present study serves as a (i) screening/training, and, (ii) a research&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a screening and training study, this protocol allows our Institute to admit children with&#xD;
      tumors of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit to the pediatric endocrine clinics and wards of the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center for the purposes of&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i)&lt;TAB&gt;training our fellows and students in the identification of genetic defects associated&#xD;
      with pituitary tumor formation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii)&lt;TAB&gt;teaching our fellows and students the recognition, management and complications of&#xD;
      pituitary tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a research study, this protocol aims at&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i)&lt;TAB&gt;developing new clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of pituitary tumors;&#xD;
      as an example, two new studies have emerged within the context of this protocol: (a)&#xD;
      investigation of a new research magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tool and its usefulness in&#xD;
      the identification of pituitary tumors, and (b) investigation of the psychological effects of&#xD;
      cortisol secretion in pediatric patients with Cushing disease. Continuation of this protocol&#xD;
      will eventually lead to new, separate protocols that will address all aspects of diagnosis of&#xD;
      pituitary tumors and their therapy in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii)&lt;TAB&gt;Identifying the genetic components of pituitary oncogenesis; those will be&#xD;
      investigated by (a) studying the inheritance pattern of pituitary tumors in childhood and&#xD;
      their possible association with other conditions in the families of the patients, and (ii)&#xD;
      collecting tumor tissues and examining their molecular genetics. As with the clinical&#xD;
      studies, the present protocol may help generate ideas for future studies on the treatment and&#xD;
      clinical follow up of pediatric patients with tumors of the pituitary gland and, thus, lead&#xD;
      to the development of better therapeutic regimens for these neoplasms....&#xD;

      Study Description:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol aims to evaluate subjects with tumors of the hypothalamic pituitary unit to:&#xD;
      identify genetic components of pituitary and hypothalamic oncogenesis, to develop new&#xD;
      clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of pituitary tumors, and to investigate the&#xD;
      psychological effects of cortisol secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect peripheral blood DNA samples and tumor tissues and examine the molecular genetics&#xD;
      of the specimens, in an effort to elucidate developmental pathways leading to pituitary gland&#xD;
      oncogenesis and/or other defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To serve as a screening protocol for future studies on the treatment and clinical follow up&#xD;
      of our patients with pituitary tumors; it is our hope that the protocol will continue to be a&#xD;
      vehicle for the development of more related clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the cognitive, psychological, and patient-reported health status of mental and&#xD;
      social well-being and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency associated with Cushing syndrome in&#xD;
      children with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular genetic testing, whole exome sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-post treatment comparison of research variables related to pituitary/hypothalamic tumors&#xD;
      and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive, behavioral, psychological, and patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
