      This study is designed as a randomized, open trial of intermittent continuous infusions of&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 in HIV seropositive patients with a CD4 cell count between 200 and 500&#xD;
      cells/mm(3). The goal of the study is to determine the optimal duration of each infusion, and&#xD;
      the optimal interval between infusions. Thirty-six patients will be randomized to 3 groups:&#xD;
      Group A will be the control group with a regimen of five day infusions of IL-2 every eight&#xD;
      weeks; Group B will receive IL-2 infusions every eight weeks, however the duration of each&#xD;
      infusion will be determined by parameters reflecting T cell proliferation, with&#xD;
      discontinuation of each infusion at a point when the response appears to be maximized; Group&#xD;
      C will receive five day infusions of IL-2; however the interval between infusions will be&#xD;
      determined by the response seen to the prior infusion, with the goal of administering&#xD;
      infusions while the CD4 cell count remains above baseline from the prior infusion. The dose&#xD;
      of interleukin-2 to be used will be 9 MIU by continuous infusion daily. All patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated at the NIH at least every 4 weeks, and at that time safety labs and immune studies&#xD;
      will be performed. In addition, patients in Groups B and C will undergo a laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation weekly, at which time immune parameters, including CD4 number and percent,&#xD;
      spontaneous blast transformation, soluble IL-2 receptor levels, and viral parameters,&#xD;
      including branched DNA assay and p24 antigen, will be determined. The study duration will be&#xD;
      approximately one year.&#xD;

      including branched DNA assay and p24 antigen, will be determined. The study duration will be&#xD;
      approximately one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant modifications to the original protocol described above, have included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. altering the number of cycles Group B and Group C participants receive at increased&#xD;
           frequency or duration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. dropping Group B from the original randomization process;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. providing continuing administration of IL-2 after the first year of the protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. changing the target CD4+ count below which participants in extension will receive&#xD;
           additional cycle(s) of IL-2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. increasing the blood volume to be drawn at each visit to accommodate additional storage&#xD;
           of plasma and serum;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. administering corticosteroids for up to 5 days during IL-2 administration to patients&#xD;
           who fail to respond to IL-2 after at least one year of administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. providing for participants to receive intravenous IL-2 on an outpatient basis without&#xD;
           the assistance of a caregiver;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. administering individualized IL-2 regimens for all patients after the first year of&#xD;
           participation. It also provided for a revised patient monitoring schedule in keeping&#xD;
           with other IL-2 protocols and for long-term monitoring of patients no longer receiving&#xD;
           IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. modification of steroid administration to allow 7-day therapy and tapering schedule;&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. allowing the use of non-licensed, but expanded access anti-retrovirals;&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. allowing, in select subjects, at home (off-site) self-administration of IL-2.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Home - patient must be enrolled and in good standing on a current NIAID protocol involving&#xD;
        the use of IL-2 therapy. The patient must already have undergone at least one year of&#xD;
        treatment on the protocol during with IL-2 therapy has been given, including at least 2&#xD;
        well-tolerated outpatient cycles of scIL-2 at a stable dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Home - The patient must have a history of generally tolerable side effects while receiving&#xD;
        IL-2 that did not require frequent medical interventions, intravenous fluid replacement,&#xD;
        and/or IL-2 dose reductions. Conditions generally not suitable for home scIL-2&#xD;
        administration would include (but are not limited to) an unusually heavy requirement for&#xD;
        narcotic usage during a cycle, significant urticaria (hives) or other allergic conditions,&#xD;
        and any history of possible airway compromise due to throat swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Home - Patient must not have experienced any serious (grade 3 or higher) clinical or&#xD;
        laboratory abnormalities of medical significance during days 0-5 of the last 2 outpatient&#xD;
        scIL-2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Home -The patient must have a strong relationship with a private physician or health-care&#xD;
        provider at home who has demonstrated close involvement in the patient's care to date and&#xD;
        who would be willing to help supervise a patient's care during each home scIL-2 cycle.&#xD;
        Because of the need to identify a single health-care provider at home who will agree to be&#xD;
        available to render care (if needed) during a patient's scIL-2 cycle, patients who&#xD;
        currently receive their home care from rotating staff members in a general clinic setting&#xD;
        may not be eligible for home scIL-2 administration. A signed written statement&#xD;
        acknowledging willingness to participate in monitoring must be received by the clinic 8&#xD;
        study team from the private physician or health-care provider prior to the first home&#xD;
        scIL-2 cycle. In addition, communication must occur between your clinic 8-study team and&#xD;
        the designated physician or health-care provider prior to each subsequent cycle to confirm&#xD;
        that individual's continued willingness to serve as on-site provider for any serious&#xD;
        medical conditions that might develop during a cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Home - The patient must live at a home address with easy access to a telephone and must&#xD;
        have demonstrated reliability in responding to telephone calls from clinic 8 staff members.&#xD;
        The patient must also be able to provide the study team with reliable contact information&#xD;
        for a close family member or friend who will agree to serve in the capacity of a&#xD;
        &quot;care-giver&quot; during each cycle: i.e. someone who will be able to render non-medical&#xD;
        assistance to the patient and be able to check on their condition daily in the event that&#xD;
        emergency medical assistance needs to be summoned. It will become the patient's&#xD;
        responsibility to ensure that the local &quot;care-giver&quot; communicates their willingness to&#xD;
        serve in this capacity by telephoning the clinic 8-study team prior to each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Home -The patient must have &quot;reasonable&quot; (i.e. rapid and close) access at home to emergency&#xD;
        medical services and a nearby medical facility in the event of a medical crisis. The&#xD;
        suitability of the at-home situation will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the clinic&#xD;
        8-study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Home - The patient must have demonstrated reliability and consistency in sterile technique,&#xD;
        the reconstitution of IL-2 vials, and the administration of scIL-2 injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Home - The patient must be receiving outpatient scIL-2 cycles at least once every 6 months&#xD;
        as part of their normal protocol participation, except at the discretion of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Home - The patient must have access to a reliable home weight scale and be able to weigh&#xD;
        themselves accurately on a daily basis for the purposes of safety monitoring.&#xD;
