      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      surgery and additional chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced nonmetastatic&#xD;
      primary cancer of the rectum. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor&#xD;
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to&#xD;
      damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for rectal cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of oxaliplatin&#xD;
      when combined preoperatively with concurrent radiation therapy (XRT) and fluorouracil (5-FU)&#xD;
      by PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the resection rate for T4 rectal cancers, the pathologic CR rate for T3 and&#xD;
      T4 rectal cancers, and the expected versus actual type of resection (APR vs. LAR vs.&#xD;
      LAR/coloanal anastomosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To make preliminary observations of patient survival and patterns of recurrence for this&#xD;
      treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate anastomotic and sphincter function following pre-op combined modality&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of preoperative oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously with concurrent radiotherapy for 5.5 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 5 patients each receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at&#xD;
      least 2 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at&#xD;
      the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo surgery 6-8 weeks after completing preoperative chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The surgical procedure is determined by the extent of the tumor before&#xD;
      preoperative therapy. The type of operative procedure may be abdominoperineal resection, low&#xD;
      anterior resection (LAR), or LAR/coloanal anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative chemotherapy begins within 6 weeks after surgery, comprising leucovorin calcium&#xD;
      and fluorouracil IV on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2.5 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually&#xD;
      for 5 years.&#xD;
