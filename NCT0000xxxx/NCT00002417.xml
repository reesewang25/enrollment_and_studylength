  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give the protease&#xD;
      inhibitor (PI) amprenavir (APV) to patients with fat production and distribution problems&#xD;
      associated with other PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protease inhibitors are very effective in treating HIV-1 disease. However, patients who take&#xD;
      these drugs often have problems, such as hyperlipidemia (an increased level of fat in the&#xD;
      blood) and lipodystrophy (problems with the way fat is produced and distributed in the body).&#xD;
      Doctors do not know exactly how PIs are related to these problems. APV has been shown to be&#xD;
      safe and effective in lowering plasma viral loads (level of HIV in the blood). APV may be&#xD;
      useful for patients who develop complications associated with other PIs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protease inhibitors are highly efficacious in the treatment of HIV-1 disease. Current drugs,&#xD;
      however, are associated with a high incidence of adverse effects as well as metabolic&#xD;
      complications such as lipodystrophy and hyperlipidemia. At the same time, though, a causal&#xD;
      relationship linking these complications to the use of protease inhibitors remains to be&#xD;
      established. Studies have shown APV to be well tolerated and effective in reducing plasma&#xD;
      HIV-1 RNA levels. The safety profile of APV suggests it may offer therapeutic potential in&#xD;
      subjects developing intolerance to other protease inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive open-label APV plus at least 2 other antiretroviral drugs. Fasting blood&#xD;
      samples and patient medication adherence questionnaires are collected at Weeks 12 and 24.&#xD;
      Bodily assessments are collected at Day 1 and Weeks 12 and 24. Hematology, serum chemistry,&#xD;
      plasma HIV-1 viral load determination and CD4+ cell count measurements are collected at&#xD;
      pre-entry and every 12 weeks for the duration of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two consecutive (at least 4 weeks apart) screening HIV-1 plasma RNA levels less than&#xD;
             or equal to 10,000 copies/ml prior to open-label drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperlipidemia with or without lipodystrophy (Grade 1-4 toxicity for triglycerides or&#xD;
             total cholesterol), be intolerant to standard protease inhibitor therapy and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the physician, be unable to construct a viable treatment regimen without&#xD;
             APV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal failure requiring dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical conditions such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             or other cardiac dysfunction which, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             compromise the safety of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction, which might interfere&#xD;
             with drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concomitant use of another protease inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following prior condition are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinically relevant history of pancreatitis or hepatitis within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous treatment with APV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk Behavior:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients currently using alcohol or illicit drugs which, in the investigator's opinion, may&#xD;
        interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior treatment with at least one protease inhibitor.&#xD;
