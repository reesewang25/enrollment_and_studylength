      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      African Americans suffer from disproportionate rates of hypertension and related&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due, at least in part, to excessive socioenvironmental&#xD;
      and psychosocial stress. Furthermore, despite the substantial individual and population risk&#xD;
      burden associated with high normal blood pressure (BP) in African Americans, there had been&#xD;
      no controlled studies to evaluate stress reduction approaches in the primary prevention of&#xD;
      hypertension targeted to this high risk group. Therefore, recent (mid 1990s) NIH and NIMH&#xD;
      policy committees called for a new research focus on primary prevention of hypertension&#xD;
      targeted to high risk populations-notably African Americans with high normal BP. In previous&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials by the investigator, hypertension and psychosocial stress were&#xD;
      significantly reduced in low SES African Americans who practiced stress reduction with the&#xD;
      Transcendental Mediation (TM) program compared to relaxation or health education controls. In&#xD;
      the most recent long-term trial, African Americans with borderline hypertension showed BP&#xD;
      reductions that would be associated with a 17 percent decrease in prevalence of hypertension,&#xD;
      a 15 percent reduction in stroke, and a 6 percent reduction in CHD in the population. These&#xD;
      BP reductions compared favorably to decreases shown with sodium restriction and weight loss&#xD;
      programs in other prevention trials. Also, pilot data from two clinical trials indicated that&#xD;
      TM was associated with significantly lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in African&#xD;
      Americans and in Caucasians with high BP over a 5-year and 15-year period, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial of stress reduction for the primary prevention of hypertension&#xD;
      was conducted in African Americans with high normal BP. African American males and females&#xD;
      (N-352, aged 21-75 years) with high normal BP (SBP 130-139 and/or DBP 85-89 mm Hg) were&#xD;
      recruited from the African American Family Heart Health Plan at the Medical College of&#xD;
      Wisconsin, Milwaukee, which housed the nation's largest registry of African Americans with&#xD;
      known CVD risk factors. After baseline assessment, participants were randomized to either the&#xD;
      TM program or to a matched health education control intervention. The primary outcome was&#xD;
      change in clinic BP over a 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included changes in&#xD;
      ambulatory BP, hypertensive events, psychosocial stress and health behaviors. Also, a model&#xD;
      of the pathways through which components of stressful experience affect high BP in African&#xD;
      Americans was tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is described as a clinical trial. The summary statement states that it is not an&#xD;
      NIH Phase III clinical trial.&#xD;
