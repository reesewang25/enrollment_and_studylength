      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAM is a rare multi-system disease that can affect the lungs of young women, is of uncertain&#xD;
      cause, is usually progressive, and can cause debilitating lung disease which may be corrected&#xD;
      with lung transplantation. Several hundred women with the disease have been identified,&#xD;
      largely through a LAM Foundation in Cincinnati, Ohio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data and Coordinating Center is located at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The registry&#xD;
      has six major clinical centers: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Mayo Clinic-Rochester, National&#xD;
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, New England&#xD;
      Medical Center, and Stanford University Medical Center. Data and lung tissue collected by the&#xD;
      registry will be used to characterize the clinical features and natural history of the&#xD;
      disease and to determine the efficacy of lung transplantation in this disorder. Eligible&#xD;
      patients are to be seen yearly for up to 4 years at the Clinical Centers or, in some cases,&#xD;
      by individual referring physicians. Tissue collected by the LAM Registry will be stored at a&#xD;
      central NHLBI repository. Outcome events include measures of pulmonary function (eg,&#xD;
      spirometry and, when available, lung volumes and diffusing capacity), arterial blood gases or&#xD;
      oximetry, walking and resting oxygen titration, cardiopulmonary stress testing,&#xD;
      cause-specific mortality, functional status, and clinical events associated with lung&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Office of Research on Women's Health provided funding in FY 1997 in the amount of&#xD;
      $100,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
