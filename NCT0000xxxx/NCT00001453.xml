  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Cushing disease have hormone producing tumors in their pituitary gland. Often&#xD;
      these tumors are so small they cannot be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The&#xD;
      inferior petrosal sinuses are small veins that drain the blood from the pituitary gland. By&#xD;
      taking a small sample of blood from these sinuses, doctors can differentiate a small tumor in&#xD;
      the pituitary gland from other tumors in the body producing the hormone. Patients with&#xD;
      Cushing disease have high levels of the hormone ACTH in the petrosal sinuses. Patients with&#xD;
      other causes of Cushing syndrome do not have increased levels of ACTH in the petrosal&#xD;
      sinuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure to collect blood from the petrosal sinus is called Inferior Petrosal Sinus&#xD;
      Sampling (IPSS). The technique is very sensitive and can tell the difference between a&#xD;
      pituitary tumor and other causes of Cushing syndrome nearly 100% of the time. However, IPSS&#xD;
      is very difficult to perform and is only available in a few hospitals. Therefore, researchers&#xD;
      are looking for another possible way to diagnose Cushing syndrome that would be less&#xD;
      technically difficult and more readily available to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTH is produced in the pituitary gland as a response to the production of&#xD;
      Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) in the brain (hypothalamus). This study will compare&#xD;
      ACTH levels in the internal jugular veins before and after CRH stimulation with those&#xD;
      obtained by conventional IPSS from patients with Cushing's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining blood from the jugular veins is a simple, practically risk free procedure that&#xD;
      could be done easily in a community hospital on an out patient basis. Researchers believe&#xD;
      that CRH stimulation will increase ACTH production from tumors of the pituitary gland&#xD;
      (corticotroph adenomas) so that the diagnostic information from jugular venous sampling would&#xD;
      be equivalent to that of IPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal to develop jugular venous sampling (JVS) with CRH stimulation as a test for the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of Cushing Syndrome would potentially contribute greatly to the&#xD;
      medical care of patients with Cushing syndrome, as a less costly, safer and more widely&#xD;
      available alternative to IPSS.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sampling from the inferior petrosal sinuses for ACTH levels differentiates Cushing disease&#xD;
      from the ectopic ACTH syndrome in nearly all patients. Patients with corticotroph tumors have&#xD;
      a petrosal-to-peripheral ACTH gradient of 2 or more, while patients with other causes of&#xD;
      Cushing syndrome have lower gradients. Bilateral petrosal sinus sampling also often provides&#xD;
      useful information on lateralization of the adenoma for the neurosurgeon. The widespread&#xD;
      application of inferior petrosal sinus sampling has been limited by concerns about potential&#xD;
      complications and by technical failures in the hands of less experienced radiologists. In&#xD;
      this protocol, we compare ACTH levels in the internal jugular veins before and after CRH&#xD;
      stimulation with those obtained by conventional inferior petrosal sinus sampling from&#xD;
      patients with Cushing's syndrome. Obtaining blood from the jugular veins is a simple,&#xD;
      practically risk-free procedure that could be accomplished easily in community hospitals on&#xD;
      an outpatient basis. We hypothesize that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation&#xD;
      will increase ACTH production from corticotroph adenomas so that the diagnostic information&#xD;
      from jugular venous sampling would be equivalent to that obtained by catheterization of the&#xD;
      petrosal sinuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently fewer than ten centers in the United States have sufficient technical expertise&#xD;
      with inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) to ensure reliable results. This proposal to&#xD;
      develop jugular venous sampling (JVS) with CRH stimulation as a test for the differential&#xD;
      diagnosis of Cushing syndrome would potentially contribute greatly to the medical care of&#xD;
      patients with Cushing syndrome, as a less costly, safer and more widely available alternative&#xD;
      to inferior petrosal sinus sampling. Initial data from 35 patients undergoing both JVS and&#xD;
      IPSS revealed no technical problems with either procedure. IPSS correctly identified 28/31&#xD;
      patients with Cushing disease, while JVS correctly identified 23 of these patients using&#xD;
      conventional criteria (petrosal:peripheral greater than 2 before or 3 after CRH&#xD;
      administration). Thus, JVS may be a useful initial procedure at institutions where IPSS is&#xD;
      not available. However, since it is likely that jugular:peripheral ratios will be lower in&#xD;
      patients with ectopic ACTH secretion (so far, 1.2 - 2.04), the protocol evaluates also the&#xD;
      performance of JVS in patients with ectopic ACTH secretion to determine whether the criteria&#xD;
      for interpretation of JVS should be different than those used for IPSS.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following characteristics may be included in the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 18-75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of Cushing syndrome. Evidence to suggest overactivity of the&#xD;
        hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, such as increased urinary excretion of glucocorticoids&#xD;
        or lack of suppressibility with low doses of dexamethasone in conjunction with clinical&#xD;
        features, will be sought prior to admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from entry to the protocol if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A clear-cut pituitary tumor is present on T1-weighted conventional pituitary MR scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There is any contraindication to catheterization. Patients with known reaction to contrast&#xD;
        material will be excluded from this elective study if they have a strong history of&#xD;
        previous contrast media reaction and cannot be studied safely by giving medical prophylaxis&#xD;
        before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Combined blood withdrawal during the six weeks preceding the study exceeds 450 ml, or if&#xD;
        hematocrit at entry is less than 33%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because of the increased risk of morbidity caused by contrast dyes in patients with a renal&#xD;
        dysfunction, patients with a creatinine greater than 1.3 mg/dl will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a diastolic blood pressure persistently greater than 100 mm Hg (with or&#xD;
        without medication) will be excluded from sampling procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They have had radiation exposure during the previous year that represents a significant&#xD;
        additive risk in combination with the expected doses in this protocol. Patients and their&#xD;
        doctors will be questioned about their exposure to radiation before they are accepted into&#xD;
        the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the questionnaire only, patients who do not speak and read English will be excluded.&#xD;
        This instrument has not been validated in non-English speakers.&#xD;
