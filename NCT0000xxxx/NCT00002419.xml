  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give adefovir dipivoxil&#xD;
      plus abacavir (ABC) plus efavirenz (EFV) plus amprenavir (APV) to HIV-infected patients who&#xD;
      have failed to respond to previous treatment with protease inhibitors (PIs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive a treatment regimen of adefovir dipivoxil, abacavir, efavirenz, and&#xD;
      amprenavir for 24 weeks. During the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline&#xD;
      in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and lymphocyte subsets and for development of adverse events and&#xD;
      toxicities. Patients who experience virologic failure are discontinued from the study. After&#xD;
      Week 24, patients with documented virologic response are eligible to continue receiving the&#xD;
      study treatment and to attend scheduled follow-up visits.&#xD;
