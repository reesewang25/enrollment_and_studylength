      RATIONALE: STI571 may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and may be effective&#xD;
      treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of STI571 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      chronic myeloid leukemia that has not responded to interferon alfa.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety profile of STI571 in patients with Philadelphia chromosome&#xD;
      positive (or chromosome negative and Bcr/Abl positive) chronic phase chronic myelogenous&#xD;
      leukemia who are refractory to or intolerant of interferon alfa. II. Provide expanded access&#xD;
      of this treatment to these patients. III. Confirm the rate of complete and major cytogenetic&#xD;
      response in patients treated with this regimen, as demonstrated by a decrease in the&#xD;
      percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive cells in the bone marrow. IV. Evaluate the&#xD;
      improvement of symptomatic parameters in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an expanded access, multicenter study. Patients receive oral STI571 daily.&#xD;
      Treatment continues for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients who respond after 12 months may continue with therapy.&#xD;
