  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel&#xD;
      (Taxol) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), followed by high-dose melphalan and etoposide for&#xD;
      treating inflammatory breast cancer. Patients also receive infusions of their own previously&#xD;
      collected progenitor cells (primitive cells that can make new cells to replace ones destroyed&#xD;
      by chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with stage IIIB inflammatory breast cancer that has not&#xD;
      metastasized (spread beyond the breast) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and chest&#xD;
      x-ray. They have computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as a&#xD;
      bone scan to determine the extent of disease, and a nuclear medicine scan called MUGA to&#xD;
      examine the heart's pumping ability. They may receive a rehabilitation medicine evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central venous line placement: Patients have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed&#xD;
           into a major vein in the chest before beginning treatment. The line remains in the body&#xD;
           throughout treatment and is used to give chemotherapy and other medications and to&#xD;
           withdraw blood samples. The line is usually placed under local anesthesia in the&#xD;
           radiology department or the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive two or more cycles of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
           Paclitaxel is given intravenously (I.V., through a vein) for 72 hours using a portable&#xD;
           pump. Cyclophosphamide is given daily for 3 days I.V. over 1 hour. The cycles may be 28&#xD;
           days apart. A drug called Mesna is given with this treatment to protect the bladder from&#xD;
           irritation from cyclophosphamide. Patients who have not previously been treated with&#xD;
           doxorubicin (Adriamycin) may receive a maximum of four cycles of doxorubicin and&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide by vein on a single day during each cycle, with cycles 21 days apart.&#xD;
           When all the paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycles are completed, patients receive&#xD;
           melphalan and etoposide, both drugs I.V. over 1 to 8 hours for three consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G-CSF treatment: After each paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycle and after the&#xD;
           melphalan/etoposide treatment, patients are given a drug called G-CSF. G-CSF, injected&#xD;
           under the skin, stimulates production of infection-fighting white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis: This is a procedure to collect progenitor cells for later reinfusion. For&#xD;
           this procedure, blood is collected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in an arm&#xD;
           vein. The blood is circulated through a cell-separating machine, where the white cells,&#xD;
           including the progenitor cells, are extracted, and the red cells are returned to the&#xD;
           patient through another catheter in the other arm. Apheresis is done after each of two&#xD;
           cycles of paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progenitor cell transplant: Progenitor cells are reinfused after melphalan/etoposide&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose infusion: A salt solution with chemically modified glucose is infused I.V. over&#xD;
           a period of from 12 to 48 hours, with subsequent donation of blood cells for blood and&#xD;
           immune system studies. Patients have a maximum of two glucose infusions, separated by at&#xD;
           least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy: Some patients have a biopsy of their tumor (removal of a small piece of&#xD;
           tumor tissue for microscopic study) before starting chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: Blood is drawn frequently to monitor safety and treatment response, and for&#xD;
           research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dental consultation: Some patients may have a dental consultation before the progenitor&#xD;
           cell transplant.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts to cure high-risk breast cancer have increasingly focused on the application of dose&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy. To date, the use of dose intensive and high-dose chemotherapy has not&#xD;
      significantly changed the survival for the majority of high risk and metastatic patients. The&#xD;
      optimal schedule and combination of agents to improve the results of high-dose chemotherapy&#xD;
      is not known. This study will pilot a combination of chemotherapy agents for the treatment of&#xD;
      Inflammatory Breast Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define, in a statistically relevant manner, the clinical efficacy of this chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen combination in the treatment of Inflammatory Breast Cancer (stage IIIB inflammatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effects of this high-dose chemotherapy on T-cells (T-cell number, phenotype,&#xD;
      cytokine profiles) and study the process of post-chemotherapy T-cell regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly diagnosed patient with non metastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer (stage III B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients treated in this study will also be eligible for entrance into other protocols of&#xD;
      the experimental Transplantation &amp; Immunology Branch that are examining strategies of&#xD;
      manipulating T-cell regeneration in adults after intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive multiple cycles of a dose intensive combination of Paclitaxel and&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide both for the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells and with&#xD;
      therapeutic intent. A second induction regimen will consist of four cycles of the combination&#xD;
      of Doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide. Patients will subsequently receive high-dose Melphalan and&#xD;
      Etoposide followed by the infusion of peripheral blood progenitor cells and granulocytes&#xD;
      colony-stimulating-factor (G-CSF).&#xD;

&#xD;
        All patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of Inflammatory Breast&#xD;
        Carcinoma stage III B. Patients with no clinical inflammatory signs but with tumor invasion&#xD;

        Inflammatory Breast Carcinoma are not eligible. All pathologic material must be reviewed&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients may be untreated or may have received prior induction chemotherapy outside the&#xD;
        NCI. If patients received prior induction chemotherapy, they may not have been unresponsive&#xD;
        to it. They may have received chemotherapy either before (neo-adjuvant setting) or after&#xD;
        local surgery (adjuvant setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karnofsky performance status of greater than 70% (ECOG 0 or 1).&#xD;

        Any patient may be excluded from this study at the discretion of the principal investigator&#xD;
        if it is deemed that allowing participation would represent an unacceptable medical or&#xD;
        psychiatric risk.&#xD;
