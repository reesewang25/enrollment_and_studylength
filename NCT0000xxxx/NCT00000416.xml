  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with rheumatic disorders (arthritis) often have trouble keeping their jobs. This study&#xD;
      will look at whether vocational rehabilitation (VR) will improve the ability of employed&#xD;
      people with arthritis to keep their jobs. Job retention VR services target key factors that&#xD;
      increase the risk of job loss. They aim to modify jobs to reduce barriers caused by&#xD;
      functional limitations and disease symptoms, future career planning, and establish a&#xD;
      partnership with a VR counselor for ongoing help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct the study among patients with rheumatic disorders recruited in eastern&#xD;
      Massachusetts. We will give 120 study participants job retention services provided by VR&#xD;
      counselors. We will give another 120 participants literature about employment- related&#xD;
      resources. We will compare the outcomes of the two groups to evaluate the usefulness of job&#xD;
      retention services in preventing job loss in people with rheumatic disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Job loss commonly occurs among people with rheumatic disorders. This study will determine&#xD;
      whether vocational rehabilitation (VR) provided to employed people with rheumatic disorders&#xD;
      will improve their ability to remain employed. VR is applied primarily to people who have&#xD;
      already lost their jobs. However, using job retention VR services may prevent, or delay, the&#xD;
      onset of employment work loss among people with rheumatic disorders. Job retention VR&#xD;
      services target important employment-loss risk factors. They do so by modifying jobs to&#xD;
      reduce barriers posed by functional limitations and symptoms, promoting future career&#xD;
      planning, and establishing an alliance with a VR counselor for ongoing assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, controlled trial conducted among patients with rheumatic disorders&#xD;
      recruited from the practices of rheumatologists in eastern Massachusetts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will randomly assign 120 study participants to receive job-retention services provided by&#xD;
      VR counselors and 120 participants (controls) to receive literature about employment-related&#xD;
      resources. We will assess intermediate outcome variables (self-efficacy, work limitations,&#xD;
      and job accommodation-seeking behaviors) and the endpoint outcome variable, work instability&#xD;
      (a measure that includes employment loss), immediately prior to the interventions and at&#xD;
      6-month intervals over a 24-month period after the interventions are carried out. We will&#xD;
      compare the outcomes of the two groups to evaluate the usefulness of job retention services&#xD;
      in forestalling work instability in this population.&#xD;
