      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widowed persons have been found to have higher mortality rates than married persons in both&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. In many of these studies, excess mortality has been&#xD;
      attributed to deaths from cardiovascular disease. Despite these consistent findings, the lack&#xD;
      of detailed data collected prior to widowhood has hampered our ability to understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms to explain this effect. Furthermore, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      this effect might help elucidate the apparent gender differences in mortality following&#xD;
      widowhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study took advantage of the data collected as part of the Framingham Study to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of widowhood on cardiovascular disease. The Framingham dataset has extensive&#xD;
      clinical data related to cardiovascular disease, as well as to health behaviors. These&#xD;
      longitudinal data provided the opportunity to prospectively characterize the health of widows&#xD;
      prior to and following the loss of a spouse in much greater detail than previously possible.&#xD;
      The analyses used a prospective design in which those men and women who had a spouse die&#xD;
      during the course of the study (N=626) were compared to men and women who remained married&#xD;
      (N=2044). These analyses also provided the opportunity to examine reasons for the beneficial&#xD;
      effect found of remarriage. The study addressed the following questions: 1. Can the increased&#xD;
      risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease often found following widowhood be explained by&#xD;
      pre-widowhood health status? 2. Can increased mortality following widowhood be explained by&#xD;
      changes in health behaviors related to cardiovascular disease risk. 3. What pre-widowhood&#xD;
      risk factors place the widowed at greater risk for cardiovascular disease morbidity and/or&#xD;
      mortality following the death of a spouse? 4. Can pre-widowhood risk factors or&#xD;
      post-widowhood behavior change account for gender differences in mortality following&#xD;
      widowhood?&#xD;
