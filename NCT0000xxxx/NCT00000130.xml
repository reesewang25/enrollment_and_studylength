  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endophthalmitis is a serious ocular infection that can result in blindness. Approximately 70&#xD;
      percent of cases occur as a direct complication of intraocular surgery. Current management&#xD;
      requires culture of intraocular contents and administration of an antibiotic. Vitrectomy&#xD;
      surgery, which may help to manage endophthalmitis by removing infecting organisms and their&#xD;
      toxins, has been shown to be of value in various animal models of endophthalmitis. However,&#xD;
      human studies have not shown an advantage to vitrectomy with intraocular antibiotics compared&#xD;
      with intraocular antibiotics alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all large comparison studies to date, eyes with the worst initial presentations were the&#xD;
      ones selected for vitrectomy. Because of the selection bias involved in determining which&#xD;
      cases received vitrectomy, existing clinical information on the efficacy of the procedure for&#xD;
      treating endophthalmitis is inconclusive. Determining the role of initial vitrectomy and the&#xD;
      benefit or lack of benefit to certain subgroups of patients will help the clinician in the&#xD;
      management of endophthalmitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, although systemic antibiotics have long been used in the management of&#xD;
      endophthalmitis, there has been little evidence to support their efficacy, but there have&#xD;
      been many reports of toxic systemic effects. In view of this, the role of systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics in the management of endophthalmitis will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) patients were randomized to one of two standard&#xD;
      treatment strategies for the management of bacterial endophthalmitis. Eyes received either&#xD;
      (1) initial pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics, followed by retap and&#xD;
      reinjection at 36-60 hours for eyes that did poorly as defined in the study or (2) initial&#xD;
      anterior chamber and vitreous tap/biopsy with injection of intravitreal antibiotics, followed&#xD;
      by vitrectomy and reinjection at 36-60 hours in eyes doing poorly. In addition, all eyes were&#xD;
      randomized to either treatment or no treatment with intravenous antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end points were visual acuity and clarity of ocular media, the latter assessed both&#xD;
      clinically and photographically. Each patient's initial end point assessment occurred at 3&#xD;
      months, after which procedures to improve vision, such as late vitrectomy for nonclearing&#xD;
      ocular media, were an option. The final outcome assessment occurred at 9 months. Multiple&#xD;
      centers cooperated by enrolling 420 eyes during the 42-month recruitment period.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Men and women were eligible for entry into the EVS if they had clinical signs and symptoms&#xD;
        of bacterial endophthalmitis in an eye that had cataract surgery or lens implantation&#xD;
        within 6 weeks of onset of infection. The involved eye had to have either hypopyon or&#xD;
        enough clouding of anterior chamber or vitreous media to obscure clear visualization of&#xD;
        second-order arterioles, a cornea and anterior chamber in the involved eye clear enough to&#xD;
        visualize some part of the iris, and a cornea clear enough to allow the possibility of pars&#xD;
        plana vitrectomy. The eyes had to have a visual acuity of 20/50 or worse and light&#xD;
        perception or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients were ineligible when the involved eye was known at the time of study entry to have&#xD;
        had any pre-existing eye disease that limited best-corrected visual acuity to 20/100 or&#xD;
        worse before development of cataract, any intraocular surgery before presentation (except&#xD;
        for cataract extraction or lens implantation), any treatment for endophthalmitis before&#xD;
        presenting at the study center, or any ocular or systemic condition that would prevent&#xD;
        randomization to any of the study groups.&#xD;
