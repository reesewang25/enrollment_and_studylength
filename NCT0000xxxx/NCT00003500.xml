    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Refractory or Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      Lymphoma provide very limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of&#xD;
      Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Refractory or&#xD;
      Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that&#xD;
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Refractory or Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage&#xD;
      II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refractory or Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients&#xD;
      receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal +&#xD;
      Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to12 months in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Refractory or&#xD;
           Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as measured by an&#xD;
           objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with&#xD;
           Refractory or Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination,&#xD;
           radiologic studies, and bone marrow biopsies as necessary, performed every 8 weeks for&#xD;
           the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for&#xD;
           the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with Refractory or Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal).&#xD;
The daily doses of A10 and AS2-1 are divided into six infusions, which are given at 4-hourly intervals. Each infusion starts with infusion of A10 and is immediately followed by infusion of AS2-1.</description>
