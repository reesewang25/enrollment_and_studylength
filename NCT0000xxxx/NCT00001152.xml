      To compare patients having PDS without and with OH or GL by documenting and following the&#xD;
      clinical features and course of their disease and evaluating the patient's performance on a&#xD;
      variety of diagnostic tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is not an uncommon ocular condition and is frequently&#xD;
      associated with myopia. There is loss of pigment from the posterior iris, seen clinically in&#xD;
      most cases as iris transillumination with pigment deposited on the corneal endothelium, iris&#xD;
      surface and on the angle structures overlying Schlemm's canal. In a subset of patients ocular&#xD;
      hypertension or glaucoma may develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular hypertension is defined as 3 separate measurements of the intraocular pressure greater&#xD;
      than 22 mm/Hg in the absence of visual field loss. Glaucoma is defined as the presence of a&#xD;
      characteristic field defect (Bjerrum scotoma, nasal step or arcuate scotomas) with&#xD;
      intraocular pressures greater than 22 mm/Hg measured sometime during a diurnal curve testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of this condition is not known. Hypotheses include developmental abnormalities&#xD;
      of the iris dilator muscle or mechanical rubbing of zonules against the iris, resulting in&#xD;
      pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber and pressure elevation. PDS is then viewed as a&#xD;
      variant of primary open-angle glaucoma or may be secondary to pigment deposited in the angle&#xD;
      structures with secondary damage to the trabecular meshwork. A hereditary component does&#xD;
      appear to play a role in the PDS syndrome and may also predispose to the development of&#xD;
      glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and determine the risk factors that differentiate&#xD;
      patients with PDS, PDS+OH, or PDS+GL by documenting the ophthalmic findings and following&#xD;
      their clinical course. In order to do this, diagnostic tests including intraocular pressure&#xD;
      and visual fields will be performed. This data may make it possible to determine the risk of&#xD;
      patients having PDS of developing OH, GL or other possibly associated findings such as&#xD;
      retinal detachment or cataract. In addition, patients with &quot;pigmentary glaucoma (PG)&quot; will be&#xD;
      compared to those with the known characteristics of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) to&#xD;
      determine whether PG is different than or a variant of POAG. When possible, family members&#xD;
      will be examined to investigate the inheritance pattern of this syndrome and its relationship&#xD;
      to POAG.&#xD;
