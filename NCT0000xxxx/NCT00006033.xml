      RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for interleukin-2 into head and neck cancer cells may make the&#xD;
      body build an immune response to kill the tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use&#xD;
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet&#xD;
      known whether the interleukin-2 gene is more effective than methotrexate for advanced head&#xD;
      and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of the interleukin-2 gene&#xD;
      with that of methotrexate in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory stage III or&#xD;
      stage IV head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of interleukin-2 gene versus methotrexate in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent or refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Determine the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of interleukin-2 gene in these patients. III. Compare the quality of&#xD;
      life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 gene intratumorally on days 1 and 4 of&#xD;
      week 1, and then once weekly for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive methotrexate IV once weekly. Treatment&#xD;
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is&#xD;
      assessed at the beginning of the study and at weeks 5, 13, 17 and 25. Patients are followed&#xD;
      every 2-3 weeks for up to 18 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
