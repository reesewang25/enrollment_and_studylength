  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in suppressing&#xD;
      plasma HIV RNA levels in infected patients, it has not resulted in eradication of virus. It&#xD;
      is now clear that virus replication persists despite undetectable plasma viremia in&#xD;
      individuals receiving HAART. In this regard, withdrawing HAART, even after prolonged periods&#xD;
      of virus suppression, leads to an almost universal rapid rebound of plasma viremia. It is&#xD;
      also now clear that prolonged, continuous HAART carries a risk of significant toxicity and&#xD;
      side effects. These recent observations may argue for a different approach to HAART with the&#xD;
      goals of: 1) durable suppression of virus replication, without an attempt at eradication, and&#xD;
      2) minimization of toxicity and side effects and improvement in patient life-style.&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to study the virologic and immunologic effects of intermittent versus&#xD;
      continuous HAART in HIV-infected individuals as a possible means to achieve these goals. The&#xD;
      primary protocol, Cohort 1, will be a randomized controlled study of 35 individuals receiving&#xD;
      continuous HAART and 35 individuals receiving intermittent HAART with intervals of one month&#xD;
      off therapy followed by two months on therapy. A second cohort of 10 individuals will serve&#xD;
      as a pilot of 2 arms of 5 patients each to evaluate the potential of shorter on-off cycles to&#xD;
      maintain suppression of plasma virus and boost HIV-specific immune responses. An extension of&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will add 5 patients to the 7 days on/7 days off HAART arm with modified exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and procedure schedule. We will analyze CD4+ T-cell counts, viral load, incidence of&#xD;
      toxicity and side effects, HIV-specific immune responses and viral resistance to therapy and&#xD;
      characterize the virus during rebound plasma viremia.&#xD;

      a pilot study of 8 individuals who will receive a once-daily HAART regimen administered as&#xD;
      short cycle intermittent therapy of 7 days off drugs followed by 7 days on drugs. Cohort 5&#xD;
      will be a pilot study of 5 individuals who will receive 3 days off HAART followed by 4 days&#xD;

        randomization (For patients who are status post-splenectomy, also CD4+ T-cell greater than&#xD;
        20%). For patients in cohort 2, the lowest documented CD4+ T-cell count must be greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 200 cells/mm(3).&#xD;
