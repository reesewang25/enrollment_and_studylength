  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the degree and sequence of immunologic enhancement and the cellular resistance to&#xD;
      certain infections after a single dose of atvogen (ampligen). In addition, the relationship&#xD;
      between activation of immune cells and biochemical markers of that activation will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of patients with HIV infection must address both the primary viral infection and&#xD;
      the subsequent immune deficiency, which is the primary cause of mortality in AIDS. In vitro&#xD;
      studies of ampligen have shown it will inhibit HIV infection. Ampligen may also minimize the&#xD;
      toxicity of many drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and induce an antiviral state in the&#xD;
      brain that may be useful in treating neurologic symptoms of HIV infection. The time course&#xD;
      and degree of immunologic response to ampligen remain unknown although they are essential for&#xD;
      proper use of the drug in the treatment of HIV infection and perhaps other clinical problems.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Ten healthy volunteers and 10 HIV-infected patients are randomized between ampligen or&#xD;
      placebo group. Five volunteers in each group receive a single dose of ampligen on day 1 and a&#xD;
      single dose of placebo on day 8. The other 5 volunteers receive the drug and placebo on day 8&#xD;
      and 1, respectively. Seven days of observation and testing follow each administration of drug&#xD;
      or placebo and also allow the body to eliminate the drug.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients' general good health should be determined by screening history, physical&#xD;
        examination, and laboratory tests including CBC with differential, erythrocyte&#xD;
        sedimentation rate, urinalysis, SMA-24, and drug screen within the established limits of&#xD;
        normal for the hospital laboratory.&#xD;
