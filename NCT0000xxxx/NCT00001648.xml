  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the structure of the receptor molecule for the herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      (HSV) and determine if the receptor's structure is related to susceptibility to infection&#xD;
      with the virus. There are two types of herpes virus-HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 commonly causes&#xD;
      cold sores, and HSV-2 usually causes genital herpes. The herpes virus enters (infects) cells&#xD;
      through protein molecules on the cell's surface. This study will explore possible differences&#xD;
      between the structure of the HSV receptor molecule in different people to understand better&#xD;
      how infection occurs. The study will also look at proteins on white blood cells (Fc&#xD;
      receptors, cytokines and mannose binding protein) that may influence the risk of infection&#xD;
      with HSV. Information from this study may lead to new treatments to prevent HSV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older who are infected with HSV and people who are not infected&#xD;
      with the virus may be eligible for this study. Participants will have blood drawn to confirm&#xD;
      whether or not they have been infected with the virus. The blood sample will also be used to&#xD;
      study the genes for the HSV receptor, Fc receptors, cytokines, mannose binding protein and&#xD;
      related proteins on the white blood cells. No more than 40 milliliters (8 teaspoons) of blood&#xD;
      will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are found to have antibodies to HSV-2 will be offered counseling and advice&#xD;
      on practicing safe sex techniques to help prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including&#xD;
      HSV-2 infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes genital, orolabial, or cutaneous lesions, keratitis, and&#xD;
      encephalitis. Recently cellular receptors for HSV were isolated. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to identify polymorphisms in the sequence of HSV receptor, cytokines or chemokines and to&#xD;
      determine whether these polymorphisms correlate with susceptibility to infection by HSV or&#xD;
      with symptoms of HSV. Blood samples from individuals who are seronegative, or seropositive&#xD;
      (with or without symptoms of infection) for HSV-2 will be analyzed to determine the sequences&#xD;
      of the HSV receptors, cytokines, chemokines, or related proteins. If a new genetic&#xD;
      polymorphism is found, additional blood samples from individuals who are seropositive for HSV&#xD;
      and from random blood donors will be analyzed to determine the frequency of the polymorphisms&#xD;
      in seropositives and in the general population. Knowledge gained from this study should&#xD;
      provide important insights into mechanisms of infection by HSV and may lead to novel&#xD;
      therapies to block infection.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HSV-2 Seronegative Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals known or likely to be seronegative for HSV-2 will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All racial, gender, and ethnic groups will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers who were seronegative for HSV-2 (regardless of HSV-1 serology) confirmed by&#xD;
        Western blot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers are willing to allow investigators to store their blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HSV-2 seropositive patients (with or without symptoms):&#xD;
&#xD;
        All racial and ethnic groups will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers who were seropositive for HSV-2 (regardless of HSV-1 serology) confirmed by&#xD;
        Western blot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers are willing to allow investigators to store their blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To determine the frequency of a genetic polymorphism in a population that has not had prior&#xD;
        screening for HSV, blood may be obtained from normal control blood donors.&#xD;
