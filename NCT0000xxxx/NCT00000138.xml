  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herpes simplex keratitis is a leading cause of corneal opacification in the United States,&#xD;
      other industrialized countries, and developing nations throughout the world. An estimated&#xD;
      450,000 people in the United States can develop recurrent episodes of the disease and about&#xD;
      46,000 episodes of HSV eye infection every year. Herpetic eye disease is the most common&#xD;
      infectious cause of corneal blindness in this country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the availability of antiviral agents that are effective in treating herpes simplex&#xD;
      epithelial keratitis, inflammation in the corneal connective tissue and iris that can lead to&#xD;
      corneal scarring and visual impairment develops in many patients. Prior to the HEDS-I trials,&#xD;
      the role of topical corticosteroids in the management of HSV stromal keratitis was uncertain;&#xD;
      some animal and human studies suggested there was a benefit to treatment whereas others&#xD;
      suggested harm. The value of adding an oral antiviral agent to treatment with topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids and topical antivirals also was unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HEDS-I trials were developed to assess the efficacy of topical corticosteroids and oral&#xD;
      acyclovir in treating HSV stromal keratitis and iridocyclitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEDS-I consisted of three randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The organizational structure&#xD;
      consisted of a data coordinating center and eight clinical centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received the topical antiviral trifluridine as prophylaxis against recurrences&#xD;
      of HSV epithelial ulceration. Patients were evaluated weekly for 10 weeks, every other week&#xD;
      through week 16, and again at 6 months. The primary outcome was the time to development of&#xD;
      preset criteria for treatment failure during the 16-week period of examination.&#xD;
      Protocol-specific descriptions of the three trials follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herpes Stromal Keratitis, Not on Steroid Trial (HEDS-SKN): Patients with active HSV stromal&#xD;
      keratitis who had not used a topical corticosteroid in the preceding 10 days were randomized&#xD;
      to treatment with topical prednisolone phosphate drops or topical placebo drops. A treatment&#xD;
      schedule, starting with 8 drops a day of 1 percent prednisolone phosphate for 7 days, was&#xD;
      progressively decreased over 10 weeks in such a way that patients received 1 drop per day of&#xD;
      1/8 percent prednisolone for the last 3 weeks of treatment. Placebo drops were given by the&#xD;
      same schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herpes Stromal Keratitis, on Steroid Treatment (HEDS-SKS): Patients with active HSV stromal&#xD;
      keratitis who already were being treated with a topical corticosteroid were randomized either&#xD;
      to oral treatment with 200 mg acyclovir capsules (400 mg five times daily) for 10 weeks or to&#xD;
      the identical dose of placebo capsules. Patients also received topical prednisolone phosphate&#xD;
      in the dosage schedule described above for the SKN trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herpes Simplex Virus Iridocyclitis, Receiving Topical Steroids (HEDS-IRT): Patients with&#xD;
      active HSV iridocyclitis were randomized either to oral treatment with 200 mg acyclovir&#xD;
      capsules (400 mg five times daily) for 10 weeks or to the identical dose of placebo capsules.&#xD;
      Patients also received topical prednisolone phosphate in the dosage schedule described above&#xD;
      for the SKN trial.&#xD;
