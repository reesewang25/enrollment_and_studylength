    <textblock>
      The clinical study entitled &quot;A Phase I Study of Infusional Chemotherapy with the&#xD;
      P-glycoprotein Antagonist PSC 833&quot; seeks to determine the maximum tolerated dose for a&#xD;
      proposed P-glycoprotein antagonist, PSC 833. PSC 833 is a cyclosporine analogue which is&#xD;
      purportedly non-nephrotoxic and non-immunosuppressive. It has been shown in in-vitro studies&#xD;
      to enhance chemosensitivity as well as cyclosporine and to be far better at increasing&#xD;
      intracellular drug accumulation than the concentrations of verapamil which are clinically&#xD;
      achievable. The purpose of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose in combination&#xD;
      with vinblastine, and to determine how the drug affects the pharmacokinetics of vinblastine.&#xD;
      PSC 833 will most likely reduce the clearance of vinblastine, as reported for the parent&#xD;
      compound, cyclosporine. This effect will increase the area under the curve (AUC) of&#xD;
      vinblastine, may increase toxicity, and requires that the escalation scheme for PSC 833 be a&#xD;
      conservative one. Initially, a 120 hour infusion of vinblastine will be given alone. Then 8&#xD;
      days of PSC 833 will follow to allow monitoring of adverse effects of PSC 833 alone. This&#xD;
      first cycle of vinblastine will be given in the absence of PSC 833; in second and subsequent&#xD;
      cycles both agents will be combined. Escalation of the PSC 833 will continue until a target&#xD;
      concentration is reached, or until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Clinical responses&#xD;
      will be monitored in order to provide the best possible medical care to our patients.&#xD;
