  <brief_summary>

      To examine, in HIV-infected patients, the safety of allogeneic lymphocyte transfer (i.e.,&#xD;
      infusion of white blood cells taken from an HIV-negative parent, sibling, or adult offspring&#xD;
      who has a compatible blood type). To measure the distribution and survival of allogeneic&#xD;
      lymphocytes in the circulation of HIV-infected patients, and to determine whether their&#xD;
      infusion results in enhanced immunity. To determine whether enhanced immunity is passively&#xD;
      transferred or actively induced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that periodic infusion of allogeneic lymphocytes obtained from the&#xD;
      peripheral blood of HLA-matched HIV-1 seronegative siblings of patients with AIDS can, in&#xD;
      some instances, restore the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes. However, more controlled&#xD;
      studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphocytes obtained by leukapheresis from a healthy, HIV-negative parent, sibling, or adult&#xD;
      offspring of the HIV-infected patient are infused at day 0 and at weeks 4 and 8. A small&#xD;
      portion of the lymphocytes obtained at day 0 will be radiolabeled prior to infusion, and two&#xD;
      total body scans will be performed. Patients also undergo two tonsillar biopsies. Patients&#xD;
      are followed weekly for 16 weeks, then by telephone periodically for 3 years (at 1 year, 2&#xD;
      years, 2.5 years, and 3 years).&#xD;
