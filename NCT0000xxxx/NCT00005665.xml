      We hypothesize that ingested human recombinant interferon-alpha (hrIFN-a) will prolong the&#xD;
      &quot;honeymoon&quot; period and enhance B cell survival in type 1 diabetes in a phase II randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. We have demonstrated that ingested IFN-a&#xD;
      prevents type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse, prolongs the &quot;honeymoon&quot; period in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      type 1 diabetics, and delays murine islet allograft rejection. The natural history of type 1&#xD;
      diabetes is unique for a phase frequently referred as the &quot;honeymoon,&quot; a period in which the&#xD;
      insulin need becomes minimal and glycemic control improves. The B cell (the insulin producing&#xD;
      cell) partially recovers. However, as with all honeymoons, they end and the patient becomes&#xD;
      completely insulin-deficient. The general consensus of the international diabetes community&#xD;
      is to test potential preventive therapies for type 1 diabetes in newly diagnosed patients.&#xD;
      Prolongation of the honeymoon as the reversal of the disease is considered a positive result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase II randomized, double-blind, parallel-design clinical trial we will determine&#xD;
      whether ingested (oral) human recombinant IFN-a will prolong the &quot;honeymoon&quot; period and&#xD;
      increase counterregulatory anti-inflammatory cytokine(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will determine the safety and efficacy of 30,000 units ingested hrIFN-a vs placebo in&#xD;
      eighty patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in a phase II trial for one year.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will be a 30% increase in C-peptide levels released after Sustacal&#xD;
      stimulation at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry. Secondary outcome will be decreasing&#xD;
      titers of islet cell antibodies (ICA). If successful, a larger and longer phase III trial of&#xD;
      prevention of type 1 diabetes in high risk patients will be undertaken. We will also&#xD;
      determine if ingested hrIFN-a increases IL-4, IL-10 or IFN-a production in peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PMNC) from patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

             dismutase-desferroxamine, vitamin E, aminoguanidine, oral insulin or other&#xD;
             experimental therapies at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of alcoholism, renal, cardiac, or pulmonary disease or in whom&#xD;
             intellectual functioning is impaired sufficiently to interfere with the understanding&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with abnormal pre-treatment values on WBC or who are receiving potentially&#xD;
             hepatotoxic medications&#xD;
