  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain patients enrolled in NIH protocol 94-I-0206 at the Clinical Center may be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in one or more of the following new options:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor/recipient extension phase - Both the recipient (HIV-infected twin) and donor&#xD;
           (non-infected twin) will participate in this extension of the CD4-zeta gene therapy&#xD;
           study. It will evaluate the safety and activity of infusing gene-modified CD4+ cells as&#xD;
           well as the modified CD8+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corticosteroid administration - A corticosteroid, such as prednisone, hydrocortisone or&#xD;
           prednisolone, will be added to the interleukin-2 (IL-2) regimen for preventing or&#xD;
           treating side effects of IL-2 such as fever and other flu-like symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extended follow-up - A more intensive follow-up will be scheduled for patients with&#xD;
           substantial numbers of lymphocytes that harbor the CD4-zeta gene. Every 3 months,&#xD;
           participants will have blood tests and specialized tests of CD4 counts, HIV-1 viral load&#xD;
           and numbers of circulating cells containing the CD4-zeta gene every 3 months&gt; the&#xD;
           frequency of follow-up visits may be reduced as time goes by.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-2 continuation - Participants will continue to receive periodic treatment with IL-2&#xD;
           to see how long the genetically modified cells persist in the bloodstream and to&#xD;
           evaluate the long-term response to IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home treatment with interleukin-2 - Participants may receive future IL-2 treatment&#xD;
           cycles at home. Home treatment involves less frequent data and safety monitoring and no&#xD;
           medical evaluations at the Clinical Center except at the beginning of each cycle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, comparative, sequentially randomized treatment with genetically unmodified or&#xD;
      modified ex vivo-expanded T-lymphocytes in patients with HIV infection who possess a&#xD;
      seronegative syngeneic twin. Genetic modification consists of introduction of a gene for&#xD;
      HLA-unrestricted &quot;universal&quot; receptors specific for the gp120 HIV envelope protein. Treatment&#xD;
      is divided into Periods I and II.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An identical twin pair, one of whom is seropositive for HIV, the other twin seronegative,&#xD;
        by standard ELISA, PCR, and Western blot testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients whose CD4+ count is less than 500/mm(3) at entry must have been on FDA-approved or&#xD;
        expanded-access antiretroviral agent(s) for at least 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Kaposi's sarcoma are eligible for this study, but must not have received any&#xD;
        systemic therapy for KS within 4 weeks prior to entry. The diagnosis of KS must have been&#xD;
        confirmed by biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anticipated survival greater than 6 months and Karnofsky Performance Status greater than or&#xD;
        equal to 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males or females 18 years of age or older. Every effort will be made to include both&#xD;
        genders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Free from serious psychological or emotional illness and able to provide written informed&#xD;
        consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unwillingness to comply with current NIH Clinical Center guidelines concerning appropriate&#xD;
        notification of all current sexual partners of an individual regarding his or her HIV&#xD;
        positive sero-status and the risk of transmission of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recent history of substance abuse unless evidence is provided of an ongoing therapeutic&#xD;
        intervention (i.e. medical therapy or counseling) to control such abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy at entry or unwillingness to practice barrier birth control or abstinence during&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - DONOR:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Untreated or inadequately treated medical condition (e.g., cardiopulmonary disease, acute&#xD;
        infection) which, in the judgement of the Principal Investigator, precludes apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serologic positivity for Epstein Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C if&#xD;
        and only if the recipient twin tests seronegative for the corresponding virus.&#xD;
