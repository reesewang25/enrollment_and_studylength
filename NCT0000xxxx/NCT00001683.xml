  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a class of membrane bound enzymes that are involved in&#xD;
      the degradation of the extracellular matrix. MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been associated with the&#xD;
      progression of cancer. It is hypothesized than an imbalance between MMPs and MMP inhibitors&#xD;
      allows the destruction of the extracellular matrix and enhances the ability of the tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and metastasize. By inhibiting MMPs, it is thought that angiogenesis and&#xD;
      metastasis can be inhibited. This is a phase I study of COL-3, an oral matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase inhibitor, in patients with refractory metastatic cancer. COL-3 is a&#xD;
      chemically modified tetracycline derivative. Patients must have clinically progressive&#xD;
      disease documented within 1 month prior to entry to be eligible for treatment. Patients must&#xD;
      have also failed therapy of proven efficacy for their disease and have an ECOG performance&#xD;
      status of less or equal than 2. Patients must be willing to travel from their home to the NIH&#xD;
      for follow-up visits. Patients with brain metastases or primary CNS malignancies are not&#xD;
      eligible. Concurrent therapy for their cancer (i.e., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, etc.)&#xD;
      will preclude participation. We will be defining the maximum tolerated dose, the toxicity&#xD;
      profile, characterizing the pharmacokinetics, and evaluating the effect of COL-3 on several&#xD;
      biological endpoints.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphoma are eligible according to the&#xD;
        criteria listed below. Patients with tumor marker evidence of disease only, will not be&#xD;
        eligible for study. A patient must have bone scan evidence of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have histopathological documentation of cancer confirmed in the Laboratory of&#xD;
        Pathology/NCI of the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health prior to starting&#xD;
        this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have clinically progressive disease documented prior to entry. Progression&#xD;
        must be documented by at least one of the following parameters: two consecutively rising&#xD;
        tumor marker levels, and/or at least one new metastatic deposit on Tc-99 bone scintigraphy,&#xD;
        and/or progression of soft tissue metastases as measured by appropriate modalities (i.e.,&#xD;
        imaging, palpation), and/or development of new area of malignant disease (measurable or&#xD;
        evaluable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have failed therapy of proven efficacy for their disease. Patients with&#xD;
        metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma will be eligible&#xD;
        without receiving prior therapy. Initial treatment of the non-chemotherapy responsive&#xD;
        malignancies (e.g., disseminated gastrointestinal, noncolorectal cancer) may be done at the&#xD;
        discretion of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a life expectancy of more than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematological eligibility parameters (within 1 week of starting therapy): Granulocyte count&#xD;
        greater than or equal 1,500/mm3; Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
        (pre-treatment transfusion is allowed, provided the hemoglobin is maintained for more than&#xD;
        30 days and/or active source of bleeding is identified and treated); Platelet count is&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 120,000/mm3; If the creatinine is greater than 1.5 mg/dL, obtain a&#xD;
        24 hour urine collection. Creatinine clearance must be greater than 60 mL/min; Hepatic&#xD;
        function: normal bilirubin (total); ALT is less than 2.5 times the normal; AST is less than&#xD;
        2.5 times the normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered from any toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, or biological&#xD;
        therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of COL-3. Patients who were receiving&#xD;
        mitomycin C, nitrosoureas, or carboplatin must be 6 weeks from the last administration of&#xD;
        chemotherapy. Patients who were receiving suramin must be 3 months from the last&#xD;
        administration. Patients with prostate cancer must continue to receive LHRH agonist (unless&#xD;
        orchiectomy has been done) but must have failed antiandrogen withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with prostate cancer that have not undergone surgical castration must continue&#xD;
        treatment with an LHRH agonist. If for some reason the LHRH agonist has been discontinued&#xD;
        prior to entry on the study, then it should be reinstituted and disease progression must be&#xD;
        documented prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with local complications which require urgent local medical therapy are not&#xD;
        eligible, but may become so after resolution of the acute problem (i.e., severe bone pain,&#xD;
        spinal cord compression, urinary flow obstruction, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have an acute, critical illness, including a serious untreated infection.&#xD;
        Ureteral stents, or foley catheter, although often colonized, are not a contraindication to&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent myocardial&#xD;
        infarction (within 6 months of enrollment), New York class II-IV congestive heart failure,&#xD;
        chronic obstructive lung disease requiring oxygen therapy or uncontrolled seizure activity&#xD;
        are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to travel from their home to the NIH for follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients of childbearing capability will be required to use contraception during&#xD;
        treatment and for two months after the completion of COL-3 treatment. All females patients&#xD;
        of childbearing potential will have a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to understand and sign the attached informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be older than or 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Although prior radiation therapy to the primary, or a metastatic lesion, does not exclude&#xD;
        an individual from this study, it does exclude that lesion from the optional biopsy. Thus,&#xD;
        if an individual has a primary lesion which has been radiated, then they can not&#xD;
        participate in that portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active infection, including positive serology for HIV. Colonized urinary tract&#xD;
        instrumentation is not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with brain metastases or primary CNS malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent therapy for their cancer (i.e., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are pregnant or lactating. No data is currently available about the excretion&#xD;
        of COL-3 in breast milk. Also, no toxicity data in gestating animals exists at the present&#xD;
        time. Until data of this nature becomes available, we will exclude patients who are&#xD;
        pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are known to be HIV positive will not be eligible for this protocol. Since&#xD;
        COL-3 is a known inhibitor of neutrophil gelatinase, HIV patients will be excluded because&#xD;
        of their increased risk of infection. HIV testing will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are currently taking anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, phenytoin,&#xD;
        carbamazepine). Patients taking rifampin will also be excluded. There is a potential drug&#xD;
        interactions between COL-3 and these classes of drugs.&#xD;
