    <textblock>
      Retinal branch vein occlusion (BVO) is the second most common retinal vascular disease after&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy. Many treatments for this disorder were attempted before 1977, but none&#xD;
      were proven to be effective. The only treatment that seemed at all promising in preventing&#xD;
      visual loss from BVO was laser photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 500 patients were enrolled in the study. One-half were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      treatment with argon laser photocoagulation; the other one-half remained untreated as&#xD;
      controls. For BVO with or without neovascularization, scatter treatment of 100 to 400 laser&#xD;
      burns was applied in the drainage area of the occluded vein site, avoiding the fovea and&#xD;
      optic disc. Individual laser burns were 200 to 500 microns in diameter with an exposure time&#xD;
      of 0.1 to 0.2 seconds. For macular edema, burns of 50 to 100 microns in diameter with&#xD;
      exposure time of 0.05 to 0.1 seconds were used. A fluorescein angiogram less than 1 month old&#xD;
      had to have been available for each patient. Treatment was performed under topical anesthesia&#xD;
      using the argon laser to achieve a grid pattern over the area of capillary leakage identified&#xD;
      by fluorescein in the macular region. Photocoagulation was extended no closer to the fovea&#xD;
      than the edge of the foveal avascular zone and did not extend peripherally beyond the major&#xD;
      vascular arcade. The efficacy of treatment was judged on the basis of visual acuity&#xD;
      measurements as well as assessment of the subsequent development of neovascularization and/or&#xD;
      vitreous hemorrhage. Patients were followed for at least 3 years.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients with three types of diagnoses were accepted:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. major BVO without neovascularization;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. major BVO with neovascularization;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. BVO with macular edema and reduced vision. All patients must have had onset of signs&#xD;
             and/or symptoms of BVO less than 18 months before the initial visit, vision of 5/200&#xD;
             or better, and sufficient clarity of the ocular media to permit confirmation of the&#xD;
             condition with fundus photography. Other eligibility criteria apply to each of the&#xD;
             three major groups as well as special cases such as the occurrence of bilateral&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
