      To utilize national population data sets prepared by the National Center for Health&#xD;
      Statistics, to (1) examine the current Black disadvantage in cardiovascular (CV) health, (2)&#xD;
      explore potential clinical and epidemiologic causes, (3) incorporate emerging knowledge of&#xD;
      new risk factors and (4) compare trends in medical treatment and risk factors for the four&#xD;
      sex-race groups.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Black health disadvantage remains a pressing public health issue in the United States.&#xD;
      According to the Department of Health and Human Services 'Black and Minority Health Report',&#xD;
      65,000 excess deaths occur each year among Blacks when compared to the mortality experience&#xD;
      of whites. Cardiovascular diseases make by far the largest contribution to this loss of life,&#xD;
      accounting for over 30 percent of the excess. Despite improvements in CV mortality for all&#xD;
      four major sex-race groups during the 1970's, the trends in heart disease in the United&#xD;
      States began to diverge. A 50 percent slowing of the decline in coronary mortality occurred&#xD;
      among Blacks from 1978-1986, compared to whites, and the gap in life expectancy between the&#xD;
      races has widened. As noted in the 'Report', despite the widespread recognition of the&#xD;
      importance of the problem, our knowledge regarding the causes of these differentials in CV&#xD;
      disease was inadequate. To address this problem, the Report recommended support for&#xD;
      'innovative uses of current data' and 'cross-comparisons from different data sets',&#xD;
      emphasizing the unique contribution population-based studies can make to 'understanding the&#xD;
      health status and needs of minority populations'. Given the deterioration of the Black health&#xD;
      status relative to the majority population, these recommendations took on new urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several separate analyses were conducted of prevalence surveys, epidemiologic followup&#xD;
      studies, hospitalization surveys and vital statistics. These separate analyses were&#xD;
      subsequently combined into a comprehensive description of the clinical and epidemiologic&#xD;
      determinants of the Black CV disadvantage, and its future trends.&#xD;
