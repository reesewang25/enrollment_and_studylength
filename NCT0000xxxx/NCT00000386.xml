      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a behavioral treatment program for children and&#xD;
      adolescents with OCD and their families. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) behavior&#xD;
      therapy, in which the patient is gradually exposed to the object or situation that causes&#xD;
      anxiety and is taught to refrain from responding in a compulsive manner, is combined with&#xD;
      family counseling (Family Treatment Program). This treatment will be compared to Relaxation&#xD;
      Training (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCD is a long-term, often disabling disorder that can cause significant family disruption.&#xD;
      ERP is a promising treatment for children with OCD, and it is thought that family&#xD;
      participation (through the Family Treatment Program) may be a helpful addition. RT is a&#xD;
      common treatment for anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive either the ERP/Family&#xD;
      Treatment Program or RT. Both treatments will be delivered over 12 90-minute outpatient&#xD;
      sessions to youngsters and their families. All participants (patients and family members)&#xD;
      will be assessed for treatment response each month during treatment, after treatment is&#xD;
      finished, and then at 2 follow-up visits over the following 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child/adolescent may be eligible for this study if he/she:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), is medication-free, and is 8 to 17 years old.&#xD;

      To evaluate a standardized multicomponent cognitive behavioral treatment program for child&#xD;
      and adolescent obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The treatment program consists of&#xD;
      individual Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) for the OCD child plus a concurrent family&#xD;
      intervention designed to reduce OCD-related family conflict, facilitate family disengagement&#xD;
      from the affected child's OCD behavior, and rebuild normal family interaction patterns. The&#xD;
      ERP/Family Treatment Program is compared with Relaxation Training (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCD is a chronic, often disabling disorder in childhood that has been associated with&#xD;
      increased rates of parental psychopathology and significant disruptions in family&#xD;
      relationships and functioning. Preliminary studies suggest that ERP is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for children with OCD although no controlled trials to this effect have been published. RT&#xD;
      was selected as the comparison treatment because of its credibility as an anxiety treatment&#xD;
      and familiarity to potential subjects. RT has been used as a comparison condition for at&#xD;
      least 2 randomized controlled ERP trials for adult OCD and shown to be ineffective in&#xD;
      treating this disorder. Although it has long been hypothesized that family participation in&#xD;
      treatment may be helpful, this is the first controlled study incorporating a systematic&#xD;
      manualized family treatment component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either the combined ERP/Family Treatment&#xD;
      Program (n=56) or RT (n=24). Both treatments are delivered over 12 90-minute outpatient&#xD;
      sessions according to detailed treatment manuals.Youth and families undergo comprehensive and&#xD;
      systematic, including behavioral, assessments by blind clinical evaluators at baseline,&#xD;
      monthly during treatment, post-treatment and 2 follow-up evaluations over 6 months. Treatment&#xD;
      outcome is examined in multimodal fashion and across multiple functional domains with a&#xD;
      special emphasis on family contextual variables. The impact of baseline functioning,&#xD;
      including family context, and initial change over time on treatment outcome is also&#xD;
      systematically evaluated.&#xD;
