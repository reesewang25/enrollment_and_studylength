      This protocol is to provide follow-up medical/surgical visits for DCS patients who are long&#xD;
      term survivors and may not currently be a participant entered on an active research protocol.&#xD;
      No investigational treatments or standard treatments will be administered on this protocol.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients enrolled on CCR clinical protocols may require long term follow-up to assess&#xD;
           outcome (e.g., survival) or the effects of prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Keeping the primary treatment protocols open after accrual is complete in order to&#xD;
           follow patients for long term outcome is an administrative burden on investigators and&#xD;
           the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To provide follow-up for patients who are long term survivors previously enrolled Center for&#xD;
      Cancer Research (CCR) trial but who may not currently be enrolled on a research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients who were previously enrolled on a CCR protocol and who are not eligible for an&#xD;
      active NCI intramural primary research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The medical procedures/tests will be based on the patient's diagnosis, treatment and&#xD;
           supporting clinical information. This is a follow-up study in which only standard tests&#xD;
           and procedures are to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical information that is relevant to the patients prior protocols will be collected&#xD;
           for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedures that entail more than minimal risk to the patient should not be performed for&#xD;
           research purposes on this protocol.&#xD;
