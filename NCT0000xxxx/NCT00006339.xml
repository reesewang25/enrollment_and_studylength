  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of an anti-HIV drug&#xD;
      combination with and without hydroxyurea in patients with early HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain combinations of anti-HIV drugs have been effective in lowering levels of HIV in the&#xD;
      blood and keeping them down. However, these treatments are not effective in some patients.&#xD;
      This study will see if using a combination containing more drugs will help in patients with&#xD;
      early HIV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy including two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
      (NRTIs) and a single HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) results in significant and sustained&#xD;
      decreases in plasma HIV-1 RNA with a resultant marked diminution in the selection of&#xD;
      drug-resistant variants in those able to adhere to and tolerate these regimens. However, two&#xD;
      lines of evidence suggest that additional and perhaps more aggressive approaches may be&#xD;
      necessary in some HIV-infected individuals: 1) the failure of some potent three-drug regimens&#xD;
      to sustain viral replication to levels below the limits of detection; and 2) the ability to&#xD;
      recover virus from lymphoid tissue obtained from those without evidence of detectable plasma&#xD;
      HIV-1 RNA using the most sensitive assays. A regimen containing more drugs with potentially&#xD;
      different mechanisms of action or synergistic activity may result in greater, more rapid, or&#xD;
      more durable antiviral activity, or reduce the number of latently infected cells in those&#xD;
      patients with acute or early HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group I begin study therapy within 7 to 14 days of screening. Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm A receives stavudine (d4T) plus didanosine (ddI)&#xD;
      plus ritonavir plus indinavir. Arm B receives d4T plus ddI plus ritonavir plus indinavir plus&#xD;
      hydroxyurea. Patients are discontinued from hydroxyurea after Week 24. Group II consists of&#xD;
      patients who meet eligibility criteria but who elect not to receive antiretroviral treatment.&#xD;
      Patients in Groups I and II follow the same schedule of evaluations. Enrollment visit (Week&#xD;
      0) evaluations are completed prior to dispensing drugs, and all patients have clinical,&#xD;
      virologic, and immunologic evaluations performed every 4 weeks through Week 24, then every 8&#xD;
      weeks thereafter. Patients in Group I take study drugs for 104 weeks with an optional 52-week&#xD;
      rollover. Laboratory results from the Week 96 evaluation are used to decide whether or not&#xD;
      patients continue on study medications. Patients who elect not to participate in the optional&#xD;
      rollover or meet criteria for treatment failure at any time during the study are offered the&#xD;
      best available treatment at the discretion of their HIV care provider and continue to be&#xD;
      followed at 8-week intervals.&#xD;
