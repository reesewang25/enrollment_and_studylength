      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory distress syndrome affects more than 40,000 infants annually in the United States.&#xD;
      The overall mortality rate exceeds 20 percent and in infants weighing less than 1500 grams at&#xD;
      birth, RDS is responsible for or contributes to the 30-70 percent mortality, depending on&#xD;
      birthweight. The present customary treatment of RDS with intermittent mandatory ventilation&#xD;
      is accompanied by sequelae such as extra-alveolar air leaks, intraventricular hemorrhage, and&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia in approximately 50 percent of survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn is a disorder in which the pulmonary&#xD;
      surfactant is deficient. It has not been possible to completely replace natural components of&#xD;
      surfactant with synthetic components and achieve a mixture which functions physiologically&#xD;
      like pulmonary surfactant. Therefore, studies of replacement therapy for surfactant&#xD;
      deficiency have used complete natural surfactants or derivatives of natural surfactant which&#xD;
      contain the defined components of surfactant. The surfactant used in the clinical trial was&#xD;
      derived from human amniotic fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two basic different strategies for surfactant treatment of respiratory distress syndrome have&#xD;
      emerged: prophylactic, or preventilatory, treatment at or shortly after birth versus rescue&#xD;
      treatment after the initiation of mechanical ventilation in instances of clinically confirmed&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome. Although treatment at birth has the theoretic advantage of&#xD;
      delivering surfactant more uniformly to the airways before mechanical ventilation, it has the&#xD;
      disadvantages of delaying physiologic stabilization after birth and resulting in unnecessary&#xD;
      treatment, at considerable cost, of 20 percent to 40 percent of infants born at or less than&#xD;
      30 weeks of gestation. Rescue therapy permits early physiologic stabilization and&#xD;
      confirmation of respiratory distress syndrome, but with the theoretic disadvantages of early&#xD;
      lung injury from mechanical ventilation in the surfactant-deficient lung and less uniform&#xD;
      surfactant distribution. Previous comparative trials have been biased by incomplete study&#xD;
      enrollment and inclusion of infants in preventilation treatment groups without evidence of&#xD;
      surfactant deficiency or immaturity. In addition, outcomes have varied in placebo-treated&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, placebo-controlled. Singleton infants were assigned to receive a placebo (air),&#xD;
      prophylactic surfactant treatment given intratracheally, or rescue surfactant treatment.&#xD;
      Multiple birth infants received either prophylactic or rescue treatment. Of 282 potentially&#xD;
      eligible infants, 246 received treatments at birth and 200 had respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      and received the full course of surfactant therapy. Preterm infants randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive prophylactic treatment received surfactant soon after birth; those assigned to&#xD;
      receive rescue surfactant had instillation at a mean age of 220 minutes if the&#xD;
      lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio was _ 2.0 and no phosphatidylglycerol was detected in either&#xD;
      amniotic fluid or initial airway aspirate, oxygen requirements were a fraction of inspired&#xD;
      oxygen of &gt; 0.5 and mean airway pressure was _ 7 cm H20 from 2 to 12 hours after birth. Up to&#xD;
      four treatment doses were permitted within 48 hours; approximately 60 percent of&#xD;
      surfactant-treated infants required two or more doses. Endpoints included the mortality rate&#xD;
      at 28 days of age, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days after birth and at&#xD;
      38 weeks to adjust for differences in gestational age, the incidence of pulmonary air leaks,&#xD;
      and the severity of respiratory distress syndrome as assessed by requirement for supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen and mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
