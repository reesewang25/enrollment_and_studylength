  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a disease characterized by decreased sensitivity to the action on insulin to&#xD;
      promote sugar (glucose) use and blood vessel relaxation (vasodilation) in muscle. Insulin's&#xD;
      ability to cause blood vessel relaxation is controlled, in part, by nitric oxide (NO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric oxide is a substance produced by the cells lining blood vessel walls (endothelium).&#xD;
      Increased blood flow to the muscle accounts for increased sugar (glucose) to areas of the&#xD;
      body. Therefore, if the cells of blood vessel walls (endothelium) are not functioning&#xD;
      properly it may contribute to insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injections of Vitamin C directly into the arteries have been shown to improve blood vessel&#xD;
      reaction to nitric oxide in diabetic patients. Researchers believe this may be due to Vitamin&#xD;
      C's ability to increase the levels of nitric oxide in blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine the effects of vitamin C on both insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      and endothelium function of patients with type 2 diabetes. An additional goal of the study is&#xD;
      to determine the effects of vitamin C on patients with vitamin C deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will undergo a series of testes to determine insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and blood vessel reactivity. Patients will be divided into two groups. One group&#xD;
      will receive doses of oral vitamin C. The other group will receive doses of a placebo&#xD;
      (inactive pill not containing vitamin C). Patients will receive the medications for four&#xD;
      weeks and then be tested again for insulin sensitivity and blood vessel reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe that doses of vitamin C in diabetics or patients with vitamin C&#xD;
      deficiency will improve insulin sensitivity and function of endothelium. Results gathered&#xD;
      form this study may provide information about vitamin C levels in diabetics and may lead to&#xD;
      the development of new therapies to treat insulin resistance and endothelium dysfunction.&#xD;

      Diabetes is characterized by decreased sensitivity to the actions of insulin to promote both&#xD;
      glucose utilization and vasodilation in skeletal muscle beds. Insulin's vasodilator action is&#xD;
      mediated, in part, by endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO). Increased blood flow accounts&#xD;
      for approximately 25% of the increase in skeletal muscle glucose disposal mediated by&#xD;
      insulin. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction may contribute to insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Intraarterial administration of vitamin C improves NO-dependent vascular reactivity in&#xD;
      diabetic subjects (but not normal subjects). This may be due to antioxidant properties of&#xD;
      vitamin C that result in relative increases in the level of NO in the diabetic vasculature.&#xD;
      In this exploratory protocol, our primary objective is to assess the effects of oral&#xD;
      administration of vitamin C on both insulin sensitivity and endothelial function in subjects&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. A secondary, peripheral objective, is to study these effects in vitamin&#xD;
      C-deficient clinical research volunteers. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp&#xD;
      procedures and forearm blood flow measurements will be used to assess both insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and vascular reactivity in diabetic subjects and clinical research volunteers who&#xD;
      have plasma vitamin C levels less than 30 microM. The subjects will then be given either&#xD;
      placebo or oral vitamin C supplementation (800 mg/day) for four weeks and assessment of&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and vascular reactivity will be repeated. Plasma levels of vitamin C will&#xD;
      be measured to confirm that subjects in the experimental group have an appropriate increase&#xD;
      in vitamin C levels. We hypothesize that chronic oral administration of vitamin C to diabetic&#xD;
      or clinical research volunteers who are deficient in vitamin C will improve insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and endothelial function. Our study will provide information about vitamin C&#xD;
      levels in diabetic subjects and may suggest a potential therapy to significantly improve&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance.&#xD;
