      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether there is prompt engraftment after autologous peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell transplantation using filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilization in patients with life&#xD;
      threatening autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the kinetics of T- and B-cell immune reconstitution after a combination of&#xD;
      timed plasmapheresis, high dose cyclophosphamide and total lymphoid irradiation, and&#xD;
      posttransplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether this treatment regimen beneficially influences the clinical course of&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC daily until peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cells (PBSC) are collected. On the fifth day of G-CSF therapy, PBSC are collected. Patients&#xD;
      undergo plasmapheresis on days -9 to -7. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 to&#xD;
      -3 and total lymphoid irradiation on day -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Following PBSC&#xD;
      reinfusion, patients receive prophylaxis with oral prednisone or methylprednisolone IV on&#xD;
      days -1 to 28, antithymocyte globulin IV on days 1-3, and cyclosporine every 12 hours on days&#xD;
      1-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or pure red&#xD;
      cell aplasia are followed on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 100, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 5&#xD;
      years. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus are followed on days 14, 28, 60, and 100, and then every 6 months. Patients&#xD;
      with vasculitis are monitored for abnormal clinical and laboratory parameters characteristic&#xD;
      of the individual type of vasculitis.&#xD;
