  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To expand the available data regarding the safety and immunogenicity of 2 HIV-1 vaccine&#xD;
      strategies: canarypox vector vCP205, or vCP205 with SF-2 rgp120. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98: To&#xD;
      obtain immunogenicity and safety data on gp120 subunits that may induce enhanced neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody response to primary isolates of HIV-1 in the context of previous immunization with a&#xD;
      canarypox vector expressing HIV antigens (vCP205). To evaluate cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#xD;
      responses at 1 and 2 years after initial vaccination with vCP205 plus rgp120 SF-2 or vCP205&#xD;
      alone.] In previous ALVAC vCP205/SF-2 rgp 120 studies, patients have developed antibodies&#xD;
      that neutralize homologous laboratory strains; over 50% of patients have developed CD8+&#xD;
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses to HIV env and gag epitopes at some point in the study. This&#xD;
      Phase II study seeks to confirm these results among persons at lower or higher risk for HIV&#xD;
      infection with a new lot of ALVAC vCP205, at a dose that is suitable for potential&#xD;
      large-scale trials. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98: Addition of AIDSVAX B/B or AIDSVAX B/E boosts&#xD;
      starting at least 12 months after receiving rgp120 or ALVAC vaccines may induce enhanced&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody response as deemed from prior studies and thus is planned as&#xD;
      &quot;follow-up&quot; therapy.]&#xD;

      In previous ALVAC vCP205/SF-2 rgp 120 studies, patients have developed antibodies that&#xD;
      neutralize homologous laboratory strains; over 50% of patients have developed CD8+ cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte responses to HIV env and gag epitopes at some point in the study. This Phase II&#xD;
      study seeks to confirm these results among persons at lower or higher risk for HIV infection&#xD;
      with a new lot of ALVAC vCP205, at a dose that is suitable for potential large-scale trials.&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98: Addition of AIDSVAX B/B or AIDSVAX B/E boosts starting at least 12&#xD;
      months after receiving rgp120 or ALVAC vaccines may induce enhanced neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      response as deemed from prior studies and thus is planned as &quot;follow-up&quot; therapy.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are recruited and screened; those who are enrolled are then stratified by their&#xD;
      risk status into 2 groups: individuals having lower-risk behavior for HIV and individuals&#xD;
      having higher-risk behavior for HIV. Volunteers are then randomly assigned to arm A, B, or C&#xD;
      and receive immunizations at months 0, 1, 3, and 6 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A- ALVAC vCP205 plus SF-2 rgp120 in MF59. Group B- ALVAC vCP205 plus saline placebo.&#xD;
      Group C- Placebo-ALVAC plus saline placebo. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98: Beginning 12-18 months&#xD;
      after initial vaccination, then 2, 6, and 12 months later, 10 volunteers from group A receive&#xD;
      saline placebo, while 50 volunteers each from groups B and C are rerandomized within their&#xD;
      respective groups, and are treated as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (subgroup 1) - AIDSVAX B/B. Group B (subgroup 2) - AIDSVAX B/E. Group B (subgroup 3)&#xD;
      - alum placebo. Group C (subgroup 1) - AIDSVAX B/B. Group C (subgroup 2) - AIDSVAX B/E. Group&#xD;
      C (subgroup 3) - alum placebo.] Volunteers are followed for 2 years and are tested for&#xD;
      humoral immune response to HIV-1. Neutralizing activity to HIV-1 is performed on a subset of&#xD;
      volunteers monitored for CTL response. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98: Volunteers receiving AIDSVAX&#xD;
      B/B and AIDSVAX B/E will additionally be studied for formation of various neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies and parameters of cellular immunity.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/30/99: Because the&#xD;
      subunit boosts that were added in version 3.0 are not available, the subunit boost portion of&#xD;
      version 3.0 is cancelled.]&#xD;
