      This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate, low-dose total-body irradiation, and donor&#xD;
      stem cell transplant followed by cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      infusion in treating patients with hematopoietic cancer. Giving low doses of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as fludarabine phosphate, and total body irradiation (TBI) before a donor peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also keep the&#xD;
      patient's immune response from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may&#xD;
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells&#xD;
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted&#xD;
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving&#xD;
      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the risk of graft rejection associated with the addition of fludarabine&#xD;
      (fludarabine phosphate) to a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen for patients with&#xD;
      malignant diseases treatable by allogeneic stem cell transplantation and compare this rate to&#xD;
      that observed among patients previously treated without fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the rate of grade acute II/IV graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD&#xD;
      in patients treated with low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine, peripheral blood&#xD;
      stem cell (PBSC) infusion and immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days - 4&#xD;
      to -2 and undergo low-dose TBI on day 0. (Note: Patients who have had an autologous&#xD;
      transplant within 90 days prior to day 0 will not receive fludarabine phosphate.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBSC INFUSION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to&#xD;
      35 with a taper to day 56. Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST TRANSPLANT DONOR LYMPHOCYTE INFUSION (DLI): Patients with stable mixed chimerism on day&#xD;
      56, and without evidence of GVHD, undergo DLI IV over 30 minutes on day 65. Patients without&#xD;
      a complete response, full donor chimerism, and GVHD after 2 months undergo further DLI at&#xD;
      higher cell numbers. Up to 6 DLIs may be given 65 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months&#xD;
      and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
