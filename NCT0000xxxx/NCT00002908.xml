      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who&#xD;
      have relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of bryostatin 1 administered as a 72-hour infusion in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. II. Gain&#xD;
      information regarding the toxicity and tolerability of escalated vincristine doses given&#xD;
      after each bryostatin 1 infusion in cohorts of patients who fail to respond to bryostatin&#xD;
      alone. III. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of bryostatin 1 in these&#xD;
      patients. IV. Determine the duration of response and survival following treatment with&#xD;
      bryostatin 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: All patients receive bryostatin 1 by 72-hour continuous infusion every 2 weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression or until 2 courses beyond documentation of complete remission. Response&#xD;
      is assessed after every 4 courses. Patients with disease progression who continue to meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria receive vincristine within 2 hours after completion of each bryostatin 1&#xD;
      infusion. Groups of 3-6 patients receive escalated doses of vincristine until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose with bryostatin 1 is determined. Courses repeat every 2 weeks, as above; no&#xD;
      individual dose escalation is allowed. No concurrent steroids are permitted. Patients are&#xD;
      followed for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 evaluable patients with low-grade NHL or CLL will be entered&#xD;
      over approximately 20 months if there are 2-4 responses in the first 15 patients. A total of&#xD;
      20 evaluable patients with intermediate- or high-grade NHL will be entered over approximately&#xD;
      2 years if there are 1 or 2 responses in the first 10 patients.&#xD;
