    <textblock>
      The present protocol seeks to advance our understanding of sclerosing glomerular and&#xD;
      tubulointerstitial kidney diseases, including but not limited to variants of focal segmental&#xD;
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). This&#xD;
      protocol will encompass studies of the natural history, pathogenesis and treatment of these&#xD;
      chronic kidney disorders. It will also allow us to: (1) provide second opinions to referring&#xD;
      physicians about management of subjects with these relatively rare kidney diseases; (2)&#xD;
      collect research samples (e.g., blood), urine, and kidney tissue obtained from&#xD;
      clinically-indicated or from research renal biopsies); (3) and treat these subjects with&#xD;
      standard or other approved therapies; or (4) invite selected subjects patients to participate&#xD;
      in limited pilot studies of novel combinations of standard therapeutic agents, such as&#xD;
      rituximab and cyclosporine. (5) Agricultural worker chronic kidney disease of undetermined&#xD;
      etiology (CKDu) is a growing problem in tropical countries in the Americas and Asia,&#xD;
      including Sri Lanka where collaborators are located. We will receive kidney tissue from 25&#xD;
      CKDu cases for pathologic examination and transcriptional profiling and blood, plasma, serum,&#xD;
      urine for metabolomic and genetic analysis from 50 cases and controls. Subjects were&#xD;
      consented and samples were collected under a protocol approved by the University of Colombo&#xD;
      IRB. These studies may provide the opportunity to generate new hypotheses regarding&#xD;
      pathogenesis and treatment that would be candidates for testing in other research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with known or suspected forms of sclerosing glomerular or chronic, fibrosing&#xD;
      tubulointerstitial kidney diseases will undergo routine medical evaluation, laboratory&#xD;
      testing, imaging procedures and kidney biopsies as medically indicated. Selected subjects&#xD;
      will be invited to provide informed consent to undergo a kidney biopsy for research purposes.&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and tissue samples will be evaluated both for standard diagnostic purposes and&#xD;
      for research purposes using specialized molecular methods that may provide insights into&#xD;
      specific disease pathogenesis. Subjects may elect to receive the results of their kidney&#xD;
      disease evaluation, NIH treatment recommendations, and return to the care of their referring&#xD;
      physicians. Other subjects may be treated with either conventional or approved agents, or&#xD;
      (with separate consent) with a novel combination of conventional therapies (rituximab and&#xD;
      cyclosporine) as part of pilot studies that would involve long-term follow-up care at the&#xD;

        Subjects with known or suspected glomerular or tubulointerstitial disease will be eligible&#xD;
        for study. No sex, race or ethnic selection will be applied. It is anticipated the&#xD;
        African-Americans will predominate, given the increased risk of FSGS in this population.&#xD;
        For evaluation, treatment, and pathogenetic studies, we will enroll children &gt;=2 years of&#xD;
        age and adults, including pregnant women and impaired subjects, if they have known or&#xD;
        suspected forms of the kidney diseases described above. For pathogenetic studies not&#xD;
        involving interventional procedures such as renal biopsies, we will also include healthy&#xD;
        volunteers, including children &gt;=12 years of age and adults. We will also recruit subjects&#xD;
        including children &gt;=12 years of age and adults with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases,&#xD;
        both with and without kidney disease, to serve as controls for subjects with the sclerosing&#xD;
        glomerular kidney diseases that are the primary focus of this protocol.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects with eGFR greater than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 at screening or at&#xD;
                  some time in preceding 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &lt; 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior intolerance of rituximab or other monoclonal antibody therapy, including&#xD;
                  severe infusion reaction or hypersensitivity to murine proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of cardiac arrhythmias, unless cardiology consult approves the use of&#xD;
                  rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Treatment with rituximab within the last two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior intolerance of cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with post-adaptive FSGS (including obesity-associated FSGS, reflux&#xD;
                  nephropathy, reduced nephron mass). There is not a strong rationale for the use&#xD;
                  of immunologic therapy in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with genetic FSGS due to a high penetrance mutation, e.g. NPHS2&#xD;
                  mutation. There is not a strong rationale for the use of immunologic therapy in&#xD;
                  this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medication-associated FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrent FSGS following renal transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic viral infection, such as HIV-1, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The safety&#xD;
                  of aggressive immunologic therapy in these diseases is in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic bacterial infection. At baseline, if the patient gives a history of BCG&#xD;
                  vaccination or prior positive PPD, we will consult with an infectious disease&#xD;
                  clinician before enrolling the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poorly controlled hypertension is defined as home BP measurements &gt;140/90 or&#xD;
                  controlled blood pressure requiring 4 or more medications. The rationale is that&#xD;
                  blood pressure elevation is common on cyclosporine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women and girls who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant or are unwilling to&#xD;
                  practice birth control. Rituximab is in pregnancy class C: no systematic evidence&#xD;
                  of safety. In humans, cyclosporine crosses the placenta. Cyclosporine lacks&#xD;
                  genotoxic effects in human and animal studies. However, growth restriction and&#xD;
                  prematurity occur in up to 40% of neonates born to mothers with organ transplants&#xD;
                  who are treated with cyclosporine, but no congenital abnormalities have been&#xD;
                  documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women and girls who are breastfeeding (possible immune suppression in infants as&#xD;
                  well as the unknown effects on growth or association with carcinogenesis.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Predicted requirement for live vaccines over the 24 months following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  ANALYSIS OF LIPID-CONTAINING PARTICLES CHARACTERISTICS UNDER NUCLEAR&#xD;
                       MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY (NMR-S) AMONG NEPHROTIC SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  We will enroll adult subjects (greater than or equal to 18 years of age), male or&#xD;
                  female, and of all racial backgrounds/ethnicities. In this cohort, we will&#xD;
                  include subjects with kidney disease or without kidney disease (healthy&#xD;
                  volunteers). We will start with subjects with preserved glomerular filtration&#xD;
                  rate (eGFR-Cr greater than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73m2) but may expand to&#xD;
                  include individuals with lower GFR in a later study. We will estimate glomerular&#xD;
                  filtration rate (eGFR) using the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In respect to proteinuria, we will accept both urine protein-to-creatinine ratio&#xD;
                  (uPCR) or urine protein excretion rate (PER) per 24 hours as a selection&#xD;
                  criteria. We will divide enrolled subjects in 3 groups as shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 1. Subjects with nephrotic range proteinuria (uPCR greater than or equal to&#xD;
                  2 g/g or PER greater than or equal to 3 gr/24hs.) and eGFR-Cr greater than or&#xD;
                  equal to 60 ml/min/1.73m2, regardless of their albumin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 2. Subjects with sub-nephrotic range proteinuria (uPCR greater than or&#xD;
                  equal to 0.2 g/g but &lt; 2 g/g or PER greater than or equal to 300 mg/24hs. but &lt; 3&#xD;
                  gr/24hs.) and eGFR-Cr greater than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73m2, regardless of&#xD;
                  their albumin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 3. Volunteers with normal eGFR and normal protein excretion and normal&#xD;
                  fasting clinical lipid testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For those subjects undergoing lipid lowering therapies for primary prevention,&#xD;
                  including statins, fibrates, niacin, ezetimibe, bile acid resins, fish oil or red&#xD;
                  yeast rice, we will stop those treatments at least 4 weeks but no more than 6&#xD;
                  weeks prior their admission. Lipid lowering therapy will not be stopped for more&#xD;
                  than 8 weeks. We will not enroll subjects who are receiving statins or other&#xD;
                  lipid lowering therapies for secondary prevention. Also, we will not enroll&#xD;
                  subjects with history of triglycerides levels &gt;1000 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The blood and urine sample collection and brief interruption of statin treatment&#xD;
                  performed in this pilot study to involve no more than minimal risk to individual&#xD;
                  subjects, with no prospect of direct benefit to subjects, but likely to yield&#xD;
                  generalizable knowledge to further society's understanding of the lipoprotein&#xD;
                  profiles of nephrotic and non-nephrotic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  We will exclude subjects with any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Untreated or uncontrolled thyroid disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Active oncologic condition&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Chronic infections including HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects receiving lipid lowering medications for secondary prevention (e.g.&#xD;
                       coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects receiving estrogen therapy or contraceptive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects receiving cyclosporine, azathioprine or sirolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects who are unable to eat the required meals due to allergy,&#xD;
                       intolerance, or dietary preferences&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects with history of pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects with reported history of triglycerides &gt;1000 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects unable or unwilling to give their consent&#xD;
