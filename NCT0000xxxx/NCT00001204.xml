  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare inherited disease of metabolism. It occurs&#xD;
      in less than 1 in 1 million people within the United States. Patients with the disease are&#xD;
      typically children and young adults who develop heart disease early in life. Children less&#xD;
      than age 5 years with this disease have suffered heart attacks and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal process that removes cholesterol particles from the blood stream does not work in&#xD;
      patients with this disease. It causes cholesterol to build-up in the arteries and leads to&#xD;
      hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to detect and measure atherosclerosis in these patients before it&#xD;
      becomes permanent and potentially life threatening. Patients with this disease can&#xD;
      participate in this study. Researchers plan to evaluate patients with homozygous familial&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia using new and standard methods for detecting atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers plan to use information gathered during this study to develop new, promising&#xD;
      treatments such as liver transplantation and gene therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal co-dominant disorder resulting in abnormal LDL&#xD;
      receptor function, profoundly elevated concentrations of low density lipoproteins,&#xD;
      accelerated atherosclerosis and death by early adulthood. This disease is heterogeneous in&#xD;
      both the degree of LDL receptor dysfunction as well as the age of death. Liver&#xD;
      transplantation has been demonstrated to virtually normalize plasma lipoprotein&#xD;
      concentrations in homozygous FH and the recent cloning of a functional LDL receptor gene&#xD;
      holds promise in the definitive treatment of this condition. We propose performing&#xD;
      longitudinal sequential cardiologic studies utilizing noninvasive techniques in homozygous&#xD;
      patients with well-characterized LDL receptor defects. Sequential cardiovascular study of&#xD;
      these patients will not only characterize the progression of atherosclerosis heart disease in&#xD;
      this disease, it may also permit the identification of individuals with would be likely to&#xD;
      benefit from liver transplantation and/or genetic engineering.&#xD;
