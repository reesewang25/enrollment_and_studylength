    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how, why and under what conditions eosinophils (a type of white&#xD;
      blood cell) become activated and will examine their function in immune reactions. Eosinophil&#xD;
      counts often rise in response to allergies, asthma, and parasitic worm infections. They can&#xD;
      also go up in uncommon autoimmune conditions and, rarely, in association with tumors.&#xD;
      Elevated levels of these cells is called eosinophilia. Usually, eosinophilia causes no&#xD;
      apparent symptoms, but in rare cases there may be local swelling and itching, allergic lung&#xD;
      problems, heart disease or nerve damage caused by the release of toxic substances in these&#xD;
      cells into body tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 1 to 100 years of age with eosinophil counts greater than 750/ml or an abnormal&#xD;
      accumulation of eosinophils in the skin or body tissues may be eligible for this study. All&#xD;
      participants will have a thorough medical history, physical examination and blood tests.&#xD;
      Depending on the person's age and symptoms, other diagnostic tests may be done, including&#xD;
      specialized studies of the eye, lungs, skin, bone marrow, nerves or heart. This is not a&#xD;
      treatment study, and no experimental treatments will be offered. Patients who require&#xD;
      treatment will receive standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain other procedures may be requested solely for research purposes. All participants will&#xD;
      be asked to donate extra blood for laboratory studies investigating how immune cells and&#xD;
      other immune substances in the blood act to stimulate a rise in eosinophils. In addition,&#xD;
      some participants may undergo one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annual Follow-up evaluations - Physical examinations and blood tests to evaluate changes&#xD;
           in the patient's condition and eosinophil counts over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be recommended during the initial evaluation, and&#xD;
           in certain patients at other times when it is important to look directly at the newly&#xD;
           developing cells in the bone marrow. For this procedure an area of skin and bone is&#xD;
           anesthetized with xylocaine (an anesthetic similar to that used by dentists), and a very&#xD;
           sharp needle is used to sample the bone marrow for evaluation. Bone marrow biopsy and&#xD;
           aspiration can have side effects of pain and/or bleeding into the skin and soft tissues&#xD;
           at the site of the procedure. Rarely the area at the biopsy site can become infected,&#xD;
           and is treated with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic testing: Some of the blood drawn from you as part of this study will be used for&#xD;
           genetic tests. Genetic tests can help researchers study how health or illness is passed&#xD;
           on to you by your parents or from you to your children. Any genetic information&#xD;
           collected or discovered about you or your family will be confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis (only patients 18 years and older) to collect large numbers of certain&#xD;
           cells - In this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm&#xD;
           vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The&#xD;
           white cells are then removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either&#xD;
           through the same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed in the&#xD;
           other arm.&#xD;

      Study Description: This study is designed to collect data and clinical samples from&#xD;
      participants with elevated eosinophil counts in the peripheral blood or tissues or their&#xD;
      relatives to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms driving eosinophilia and eosinophil&#xD;
      activation in patients with a wide range of eosinophilic disorders with the ultimate goal of&#xD;
      improving diagnostics and identifying novel treatment modalities for these patients.&#xD;
      Eosinophilic participants will undergo an extensive clinical evaluation at baseline and at&#xD;
      least yearly thereafter focused on the identification of the cause of eosinophilia and the&#xD;
      presence of end organ manifestations. Blood, bone marrow, tissue, and/or body fluids will be&#xD;
      collected for research purposes at initial and follow-up visits to address broader questions&#xD;
      relating to the varied etiologies of eosinophilia, biomarkers of disease activity and&#xD;
      eosinophil activation, and the functional role of eosinophils in homeostasis and disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis. While this protocol is not primarily designed to study treatment of&#xD;
      eosinophilic patients, the clinical and immunological responses to therapy will be monitored.&#xD;
      This protocol will also allow clinical and laboratory evaluation of family members of&#xD;
      subjects with eosinophilia to help identify genetic causes of eosinophilia and to provide&#xD;
      controls for immunologic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primary Objective: to understand the mechanisms driving eosinophilia and&#xD;
      eosinophil activation in patients with a wide range of eosinophilic disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a diagnostic algorithm that accurately classifies eosinophilic patients by&#xD;
           underlying etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the mechanisms underlying eosinophil activation and recruitment to the&#xD;
           blood and tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To understand the mechanisms of action of therapeutic agents used or in development for&#xD;
           the treatment of HES&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the signs and symptoms experienced by patients with HES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the multifunctional role of eosinophils in settings other than HES&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand the long-term effects of eosinophilia in patients with HES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;

      syndromes (HES)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Identification of laboratory and clinical tests that distinguish between clinical and&#xD;
      genetic variants of HES&#xD;
&#xD;
      2a. Identification of biomarkers of disease activity and specific organ involvement in&#xD;
      eosinophilic disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      2b. Identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of HES&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Delineation of the effects of therapeutic agents on eosinophil development, activation,&#xD;
      recruitment to tissues and/or apoptosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Creation of a patient-related outcomes questionnaire for use in future treatment studies&#xD;
      of HES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of the consequences of eosinophilia and/or eosinophil depletion in the&#xD;
           context of varied immunologic and inflammatory&#xD;
&#xD;
           settings&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collection of standardized longitudinal data on disease activity and outcome in patients&#xD;
           with hypereosinophilia.&#xD;
