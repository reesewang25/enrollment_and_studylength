  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DDD pacing improves symptoms and relieves LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction in most&#xD;
      patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Notably, when pacing is temporarily&#xD;
      discontinued, the beneficial effects of pacing are evident in sinus rhythm. The long term&#xD;
      results of this novel therapy are, however, uncertain. We propose (1) to record the&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes following &gt;4 years of pacing; and (2) to determine whether DDD pacing&#xD;
      continues to be necessary in patients who have had a substantial relief of their LVOT&#xD;
      obstruction. Patients who have had &gt;50% reduction in LVOT pressure gradients will be&#xD;
      randomized to two pacing modalities: DDD at 70 beats per minute and AAI pacing at 70 beats&#xD;
      per minute (DDD switched off), and reevaluated after a six-month period.&#xD;

        Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HCM patients, aged grater than 20 years of either gender who received DDD pacemakers at the&#xD;
        NIH at least 4 years ago, for relief of LVOT obstruction and drug-refractory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HCM patients selected from Group 1 who at the follow-up cardiac catheterization are&#xD;
        demonstrated to have either (1) no significant LVOT obstruction (less than 30mm HG at rest&#xD;
        and less than 50mm HG with Isuprel); or (2) a substantial reduction of the LVOT obstruction&#xD;
        (greater than 50% reduction in LVOT gradient).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient who have developed a heart block will be excluded from group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females must have a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
