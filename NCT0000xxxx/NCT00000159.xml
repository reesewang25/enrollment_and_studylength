      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug sorbinil, an aldose reductase&#xD;
      inhibitor, in preventing the development of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy in persons&#xD;
      with insulin-dependent diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the last two decades, vision researchers have studied intensively the role of the&#xD;
      enzyme aldose reductase (AR) in diabetic cataract and in other diabetic complications. The&#xD;
      potentially damaging effects of AR in diabetes were first discovered in the lens fiber cells.&#xD;
      In these cells, the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of high levels of glucose to sorbitol&#xD;
      through the polyol pathway and initiates a sequence of events that eventually results in&#xD;
      opacification of the lens. Because sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) and fructose (a subsequent&#xD;
      product of glucose metabolism) cannot readily diffuse across cell membranes, they become&#xD;
      trapped in lens fiber cells. There they accumulate at unusually high levels and exert a&#xD;
      significant osmotic stress, causing an influx of water and swelling of the lens fibers. Major&#xD;
      electrolytic and osmotic changes then occur that lead to lens opacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the detection of AR in the pericytes of retinal capillaries -- cells that are&#xD;
      involved very early in the evolution of diabetic retinopathy -- suggests that this enzyme may&#xD;
      also play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Scientists now know that AR is present&#xD;
      in nerve tissue, and they speculate that in diabetes it induces the depletion of myo&#xD;
      -inositol, which leads to the lessening of nerve conduction velocity in diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemicals that inhibit aldose reductase have proved effective in preventing damage to the&#xD;
      lens, in preventing thickening of retinal capillary basement membranes in diabetic animals,&#xD;
      and in improving nerve conduction velocity values in patients with diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is possible that AR inhibitors also may be able to prevent, delay, or halt the&#xD;
      development or progression of diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, an AR inhibitor developed by Pfizer Inc., sorbinil, was studied in&#xD;
      this clinical trial. (Other AR inhibitors underwent study in clinical trials sponsored by&#xD;
      Ayerst and Alcon.) Initially, 402 patients were randomized into the double-masked treatment&#xD;
      period using a dosage schedule of one 250-mg tablet daily. In 1985, recruitment was&#xD;
      voluntarily halted by Pfizer because of several serious hypersensitivity reactions among&#xD;
      patients taking sorbinil in clinical trials in the United States and Europe. In November&#xD;
      1985, recruitment resumed, using a titrated dosage schedule of 25 mg daily for 2 weeks,&#xD;
      followed by 75 mg daily for 2 weeks, then 250 mg daily for the duration. A total of 497&#xD;
      patients participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followup visits were scheduled weekly for the first 4 weeks, monthly for the next 2 months,&#xD;
      and every 3 months thereafter. For patients assigned to the titration protocol, additional&#xD;
      visits were made at weeks 5 and 6. A complete history was recorded and a physical examination&#xD;
      was conducted every 15 months; electrocardiogram was recorded every 6 months. In addition,&#xD;
      patients were cautioned to note any signs of hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy visits, scheduled at 9-month intervals after the first visit at 12 months, included&#xD;
      fundus photographs, visual acuity examinations according to the Early Treatment Diabetic&#xD;
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), red blood cell sorbitol measure, and assessment of coronary risk&#xD;
      factor classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sorbinil Retinopathy Trial (SRT) was a unique collaboration between private industry and&#xD;
      the Federal government in designing, funding, and conducting a multicenter, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. Pfizer Inc. supported 10 of the 11 participating Clinical Centers, provided&#xD;
      the medication, and funded the Data Coordinating Center and Fundus Photograph Reading Center.&#xD;
      The National Eye Institute funded the Policy, Data, and Safety Monitoring Committee and its&#xD;
      own participating Clinical Center.&#xD;

        Men and women eligible for the SRT had diabetes for 1 to 15 years and were between ages 18&#xD;
        and 56 at the time of enrollment. They had begun taking insulin before their 41st birthday.&#xD;
        Their hemoglobin A1c value was within the diabetic range. On retinal examination, they&#xD;
        showed no evidence of or only very mild retinopathy, with no more than five microaneurysms&#xD;
        per eye. Women were postmenopausal, sterile, or had an IUD in place.&#xD;
