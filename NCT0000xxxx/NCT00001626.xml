  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) is a rare and very serious blood disorder in which the bone&#xD;
      marrow stops producing the cells which make up blood; red blood cells, white blood cells, and&#xD;
      platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe this is caused by an autoimmune reaction, a condition in which the&#xD;
      natural defense system of the body begins attacking itself. In SAA the immune system begins&#xD;
      attacking the bone marrow. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen to all of the&#xD;
      organ systems in the body, and low numbers (anemia) can cause difficulty breathing and&#xD;
      fatigue. Platelets are responsible for normal blood clotting and low numbers can result in&#xD;
      easy bruising and bleeding which can be deadly. White blood cells are responsible for&#xD;
      fighting infections, and low numbers of these can lead to frequent infections, the most&#xD;
      common cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAA can be treated by bone marrow transplant (BMT) or by drugs designed to slow down the&#xD;
      immune system (immunosuppressants). BMT can be successful, but it requires a donor with&#xD;
      matched bone marrow, making this therapy available only to a few patients. BMT with unmatched&#xD;
      bone marrow can fail and cause dangerous side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, the two drugs used to treat SAA by slowing down the immune system&#xD;
      (immunosuppression) are antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporin A (CSA). When used in&#xD;
      combination these two drugs can improve most patients condition. However, one third of the&#xD;
      patients who respond to this therapy experience a relapse of SAA. In addition, some patients&#xD;
      treated with ATG/CSA can later develop other disorders of the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, researchers have found that another immunosuppressive drug called cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      has been successful at treating patients with SAA. In addition, patients treated with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide do not experience relapses or develop other disorders of the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers would like to compare the combinations of antithymocyte globulin&#xD;
      (ATG) and cyclosporin A (CSA) to cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin A (CSA) for the treatment&#xD;
      of SAA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a disorder with a poor prognosis if untreated. Current&#xD;
      accepted therapeutic strategies include bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and&#xD;
      immunosuppression, both offering cure or amelioration in the majority of patients. Although&#xD;
      BMT is successful using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling bone marrow, the 25%&#xD;
      probability of finding an HLA identical sibling within a family renders this approach&#xD;
      available to only a minority of patients. BMT utilizing HLA-matched, unrelated donors carries&#xD;
      a high risk of treatment failure along with considerable toxicity. While combined&#xD;
      immunosuppression with both antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CSA) produces&#xD;
      hematologic improvement in most patients, relapse is common, occurring in about a third of&#xD;
      responders. Late evolution of aplastic anemia to other serious hematologic disorders is a&#xD;
      significant problem following successful treatment with ATG/CSA with paroxysmal nocturnal&#xD;
      hemoglobinuria (PNH) occurs in approximately 13%, myelodysplasia in about 10%, and acute&#xD;
      leukemia in about 7%. Recently, results of immunosuppression in SAA with another potent&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agent, cyclophosphamide, were reported in 10 patients. In this small group,&#xD;
      the overall response rate was similar to that seen with ATG/CSA, but relapse and late clonal&#xD;
      disease were not seen during a median follow-up of greater than 10 years. In the larger&#xD;
      randomized trial proposed here, we will compare sustained hematologic response rates to&#xD;
      either conventional immunosuppression with ATG/CSA or high dose cyclophosphamide and CSA.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include response duration, event free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
