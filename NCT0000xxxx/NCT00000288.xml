      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of varying doses of cotinine on&#xD;
      cigarette self-administration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, antagonizes some of the&#xD;
      effects of nicotine. One study showed that nicotine eliminates some of the beneficial effects&#xD;
      of the nicotine patch in reducing withdrawal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      examine the effects of cotinine. The results generally showed no effects on&#xD;
      self-administration of cigarettes, although higher serum nicotine levels were observed on the&#xD;
      highest doses of cotinine compared to placebo or lower doses of cotinine.&#xD;
