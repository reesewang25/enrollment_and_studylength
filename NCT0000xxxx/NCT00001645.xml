    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, treat and follow patients with parasitic&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with a known or suspected parasitic infection who are at least 1 year old may be&#xD;
      enrolled. This study does not involve any experimental treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical examination and laboratory tests on blood, stool, or urine.&#xD;
      Blood samples may be collected at regular intervals, but no more than 450 ml (15 ounces) of&#xD;
      blood will be drawn from adults, and no more than 7 ml (1-1/2 teaspoons) per kg (2.2 pounds)&#xD;
      of body weight from children, in any 6-week period. Other tests may include x-rays,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG), or tissue biopsy (surgical removal of a small tissue sample),&#xD;
      depending on the individual s condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be offered treatment or may be referred to another study that is more&#xD;
      appropriate for the problem. Any treatment provided in this study will be according to&#xD;
      standard medical practice for the patient s specific medical problem. Patients responses to&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated at regularly scheduled clinic visits. The length of time between&#xD;
      visits and the total duration of the study for a given individual will be determined by the&#xD;
      study doctor, based on that person s medical condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective study to evaluate and treat patients with parasitic&#xD;
      infection. Patients with known or suspected parasitic infection will be enrolled and will be&#xD;
      evaluated for the presence of a parasitic infection. Minimal studies scheduled for each visit&#xD;
      will include a medical history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests and&#xD;
      specialized diagnostic procedures for possible parasitic infections. Treatment plans will be&#xD;
      individualized for each patient's particular condition, and the number and length of&#xD;
      additional visits and diagnostic evaluations will vary accordingly. Specific treatment&#xD;
      regimens will be in accordance with standard medical practice.&#xD;
