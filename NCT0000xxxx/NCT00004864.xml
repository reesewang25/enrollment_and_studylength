      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Gene therapy such as GEM 231 may inhibit the growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      and make the tumor more sensitive to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and GEM 231 in&#xD;
      treating patients who have recurrent or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel and GEM 231 in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. Determine any preliminary antitumor&#xD;
      activity of GEM 231 in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of GEM 231 and docetaxel. Patients receive docetaxel&#xD;
      IV over 1 hour on day 1, immediately followed by GEM 231 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and&#xD;
      11. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with escalating doses of GEM 231 and docetaxel&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which&#xD;
      no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly&#xD;
      for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 1 patient will be accrued per week for this study until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose is reached.&#xD;
