  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and toleration of&#xD;
      voriconazole in the primary treatment of systemic or invasive fungal infections due to fungal&#xD;
      pathogens for which there is no licensed therapy; and in the secondary treatment of systemic&#xD;
      or invasive fungal infections in patients failing or intolerant to treatment with approved&#xD;
      systemic antifungal agents. This trial is a Phase II multicenter, open label study&#xD;
      investigating the utilization of voriconazole for the treatment of systemic or invasive&#xD;
      fungal infections. Enrollment is targeted for 150 patients to be recruited from multiple&#xD;
      centers. The patient population will consist of patients with proven, deeply invasive fungal&#xD;
      infection for which there is no licensed therapy or if the patient is failing or intolerant&#xD;
      to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents. Voriconazole will be administered&#xD;
      initially by a loading dose of 6 mg/kg q12 hours for the first two doses followed by 4 mg/kg&#xD;
      q12 hours. Efficacy will be evaluated by clinical, radiological and microbiological response.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Males or (non-pregnant) females greater than or equal to 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have one of the following systemic or invasive fungal infections at baseline:&#xD;
        systemic or invasive infection due to a fungal pathogen for which there is currently no&#xD;
        licensed treatment or systemic or invasive fungal infection, with evidence of failure&#xD;
        and/or intolerance/toxicity to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definitions of failure to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For invasive aspergillosis and other invasive fungal infections - lack of clinical response&#xD;
        after at least 7 days of systemic antifungal treatment at adequate doses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        For candida esophagitis only - lack of clinical response after at least 14 days of&#xD;
        fluconazole at a dose of greater than or equal to 200 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definition of intolerance/toxicity to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intolerance to the infusion-related toxicities of amphotericin B preparations despite&#xD;
        appropriate supportive therapy, OR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nephrotoxicity defined as a serum creatinine that had increased by greater than 1.5 mg/dl&#xD;
        while receiving amphotericin B therapy, OR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pre-existing renal impairment defined as a serum creatinine that increased to greater than&#xD;
        2.0 mg/dl due to reasons other than amphotericin B therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The systemic or invasive fungal infection must be present at baseline and documented within&#xD;
        four weeks preceding study entry as follows: positive histopathology with evidence of&#xD;
        tissue invasion by fungal elements or positive serology where diagnostic (CSF cryptococcal&#xD;
        antigen; serum or CSF Coccidioides antibody; serum, CSF or urine Histoplasma antigen) or&#xD;
        positive mycologic culture from a normally sterile site, taken during the current episode&#xD;
        of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of child bearing potential (or less than 2 years post-menopausal) must have a&#xD;
        negative serum pregnancy test at baseline, and must agree to use barrier methods of&#xD;
        contraception during the study. Women may not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Signed written informed consent must be obtained at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Assent will be obtained from minors capable of understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects may not have previously participated in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be receiving or be unable to discontinue the following drugs at least 24&#xD;
        hours prior to randomization: terfenadine, cisapride and astemizole (due to the possibility&#xD;
        of QTc prolongation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be receiving or be unable to discontinue sulphonylureas at least 24 hours&#xD;
        prior to randomization (as these compounds have a narrow therapeutic window and an increase&#xD;
        in plasma levels may lead to hypoglycemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have received the following drugs within 14 days prior to randomization:&#xD;
        rifampin, carbamazepine and barbiturates as these are potent inducers of hepatic enzymes&#xD;
        and will result in undetectable levels of voriconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be participating in a blinded trial of any investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have AST, ALT, total bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase greater than 5&#xD;
        times the upper limit normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with a serum creatinine greater than 3.5 mg/dl or with end-stage renal disease&#xD;
        requiring chronic dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, zygomycoses,&#xD;
        isolated candiduria, and/or catheter-or-device-related candidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have fungal infections not considered to be invasive or systemic including&#xD;
        dermatophytosis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be receiving or likely to receive any investigational drug (any unlicensed&#xD;
        new chemical entity), except one of the following classes of medications: cancer&#xD;
        chemotherapeutic agents, antiretrovirals, or other therapies for HIV/AIDS-related&#xD;
        opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be receiving or likely to receive the following medications or treatments&#xD;
        during the study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        G-CSF or GM-CSF (for other than treatment of granulocytopenia);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any systemic antifungal medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        White blood cell transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have hypersensitivity or intolerance to azole antifungal agents including&#xD;
        miconazole, ketocanazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a life expectancy greater than 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect&#xD;
        subject safety, preclude evaluation of response, or render it unlikely that the&#xD;
        contemplated course of therapy can be completed.&#xD;
