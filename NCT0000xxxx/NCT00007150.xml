    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a test called MCV in guiding phlebotomy (blood&#xD;
      drawing) therapy in patients with hemochromatosis an inherited disorder that causes too much&#xD;
      iron to be absorbed by the intestine. The excess damages body tissues, most severely in the&#xD;
      liver, heart, pancreas and joints. Because iron is carried in the hemoglobin of red blood&#xD;
      cells, removing blood can effectively lower the body s iron stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hemochromatosis undergo weekly phlebotomy treatments (1 pint per session) to&#xD;
      deplete iron stores. This usually requires 10 to 50 treatments, after which blood is drawn&#xD;
      every 8 to 12 weeks to prevent a re-build up of iron. A test that measures ferritin a protein&#xD;
      involved in storing iron is commonly used to guide phlebotomy therapy in hemochromatosis&#xD;
      patients. This study will compare the usefulness of the ferritin test with that of MCV, which&#xD;
      measures red blood cell size, in guiding phlebotomy therapy. In addition, the study will 1)&#xD;
      examine whether keeping iron levels low during maintenance therapy can help heal severe liver&#xD;
      disease and improve arthritis in affected patients, and 2) design a system for making blood&#xD;
      collected from hemochromatosis donors available for transfusion into other patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 15 years and older with diagnosed hemochromatosis or very high iron levels&#xD;
      suggesting possible hemochromatosis may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a&#xD;
      history, physical evaluation, review of medical records and blood tests, and complete a&#xD;
      symptoms questionnaire. Participants will have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phlebotomy therapy every 1 to 2 weeks, depending on iron levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection for blood cell counts and iron studies at every phlebotomy&#xD;
           session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection (about 2 tablespoons) every 1 to 2 weeks after iron stores have&#xD;
           been depleted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phlebotomy every 8 to 12 weeks after iron stores are used up to prevent re-build up of&#xD;
           excess iron&#xD;
&#xD;
      With each blood donation that will be made available for transfusion to other patients,&#xD;
      participants will answer the same health history screening questions and undergo the same&#xD;
      blood tests given to all regular volunteer blood donors. These include screening for the HIV&#xD;
      and hepatitis viruses and for syphilis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet height and weight requirements may be asked to consider &quot;double red cell&quot;&#xD;
      donations using apheresis. In this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle&#xD;
      placed in an arm vein, similar to routine phlebotomy. The blood then circulates through a&#xD;
      machine that separates it into its components. The red cells are removed and the rest of the&#xD;
      blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle or through a second needle in&#xD;
      the other arm. Patients who have very high iron levels or an enlarged liver will be offered&#xD;
      evaluation by the NIH Liver Service. Those judged to be at increased risk for cirrhosis may&#xD;
      be advised to undergo a liver biopsy. If cirrhosis is found, the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      consider a repeat biopsy after 3 to 5 years of continuous iron depletion to see if scarring&#xD;
      has improved. Patients with arthritis will be offered evaluation by the NIH Arthritis Service&#xD;
      and, depending on symptoms, may be advised to have X-ray studies or a joint biopsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) occurs in 1 in every 200-250 individuals of northern European&#xD;
      descent, and is the most common inherited disease in this population. Although the molecular&#xD;
      pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, a homozygous mutation in the HFE gene&#xD;
      (Cys282Tyr) is observed in nearly 100% of clinically confirmed cases. The clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of HH are due to inappropriately increased iron absorption with excessive iron&#xD;
      deposition in the liver, heart, endocrine organs, and joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phlebotomy treatment, with removal of iron contained in the hemoglobin of red cells, is the&#xD;
      only effective therapy for HH. Phlebotomy therapy relieves many of the symptoms of&#xD;
      iron-mediated tissue damage and prevents progression to cirrhosis. However, published&#xD;
      laboratory guidelines for monitoring phlebotomy therapy are based on retrospective data, and&#xD;
      in general allow a moderate level of iron overload to persist during maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      Since 1987, the DTM has piloted the use of the red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV), in&#xD;
      conjunction with the hemoglobin, as a prospective guide to phlebotomy therapy in a small&#xD;
      cohort of HH patients. In contrast to other retrospectively-derived guidelines, this simple,&#xD;
      inexpensive, physiologic method was found to be a precise indicator of iron-limited&#xD;
      erythropoiesis, and could be easily applied to adjust the pace of phlebotomy and prevent&#xD;
      excess iron reaccumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the majority of persons with HH meet eligibility criteria for allogeneic blood&#xD;
      donation, until recently regulatory guidelines restricted the use of therapeutically&#xD;
      withdrawn blood for transfusion. New regulations now permit increased flexibility in the use&#xD;
      of such units for this purpose. The purposes of this protocol are: (1) to prospectively study&#xD;
      the genotypic and phenotypic response to phlebotomy therapy in HH patients using the&#xD;
      MCV/hemoglobin monitoring guide, and to validate the use of this guide in a large study&#xD;
      cohort; (2) to evaluate the course of severe hepatic disease and rheumatologic symptoms&#xD;
      following sustained iron depletion; and (3) to establish the safety and efficacy and document&#xD;
      the operational issues inherent in a program to collect therapeutically withdrawn blood for&#xD;
      use in allogeneic transfusion. These goals have as their combined target the establishment of&#xD;
      the simplest, safest system for donor processing, phlebotomy management, and transfusion of&#xD;
      blood drawn from HH subjects.&#xD;
