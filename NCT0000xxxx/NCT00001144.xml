    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a new stem cell transplant&#xD;
      procedure for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplantation of donated stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into the&#xD;
      different blood components-white cells, red cells and platelets) is a very effective&#xD;
      treatment for CML. However, despite its success in a large number of patients, there is still&#xD;
      a significant risk of death from the procedure. In addition, it results in sterility and&#xD;
      leaves patients at increased risk for other cancers and for eye cataracts. These&#xD;
      complications result from the intensive chemotherapy and radiation patients receive before&#xD;
      the transplant to rid the body of cancer cells. In this study, radiation will not be used and&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs will be given in lower doses to try to reduce the dangers of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CML will be tested for matching with a donor (family member) and will undergo a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination and several tests (e.g., breathing tests, X-rays, and&#xD;
      others) to determine eligibility for the study. Participants will then undergo apheresis to&#xD;
      collect lymphocytes (white blood cells important in the immune system). In apheresis, whole&#xD;
      blood is drawn through a needle in the arm, similar to donating a unit of blood. The required&#xD;
      component-in this case, lymphocytes-are separated and removed, and the rest of the blood is&#xD;
      returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day starting five days before the transplant, the donor will be given an injection of&#xD;
      G-CSF, a drug that releases stem cells from the bone marrow into the blood stream. The cells&#xD;
      will be collected after the fifth injection and again after a sixth injection the following&#xD;
      day. Meanwhile, patients will be given cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and perhaps&#xD;
      anti-thymocyte globulin, to prevent rejection of the donated cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the transplant, patients will be given cyclosporin to prevent&#xD;
      graft-versus-host-disease, a disease in which the donor cells react against the patient's&#xD;
      cells. They may also be given lymphocytes after the transplant to boost the immune system and&#xD;
      destroy leukemia cells. After 30, 60 and 100 days, bone marrow cells and circulating&#xD;
      lymphocytes will be checked to see how many are of donor cell origin. If less than 100&#xD;
      percent are of donor origin, more lymphocytes will be transfused. Patients will have physical&#xD;
      examinations and blood tests at least weekly for 3 months and then periodically for 5 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CML is a disease which progresses to blast crisis within five years of onset despite medical&#xD;
      intervention. Allogeneic transplantation has provided a definitive cure for a large number of&#xD;
      patients. The International Bone Marrow transplant registry reports a 67% three-year disease&#xD;
      free survival for CML patients receiving a matched sibling transplant. However there remains&#xD;
      a 17-20% treatment-related mortality and significant long-term complications. Myeloablative&#xD;
      regimens with total body irradiation (TBI) are associated with certain sterility, along with&#xD;
      a significant incidence of cataracts and second malignancies. Efforts to ameliorate this&#xD;
      toxicity have led to the development of regimens lacking total body irradiation. Although the&#xD;
      follow-up period for patients receiving these regimens has not been long enough to answer the&#xD;
      question of long-term toxicity, it appears that the response rate and the disease free&#xD;
      survival are comparable to regimens containing TBI. In addition, transplantation experience&#xD;
      with aplastic anemia where TBI is not part of the regimen indicates that treatment related&#xD;
      mortality along with the risk of long-term sequela are significantly decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplants are currently being&#xD;
      investigated in phase I/II trials assessing engraftment efficacy and toxicity at a number of&#xD;
      transplant centers. Preliminary data, including our own experience with 30 patients&#xD;
      undergoing this type of procedure, has shown a high rate of complete donor engraftment with a&#xD;
      low toxicity profile. Two recent studies investigating non-myeloablative allo-transplantation&#xD;
      in standard risk patients revealed an extremely low rate of transplant-related complications&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol we investigate non-myeloablative allogeneic PBSC transplantation in patients&#xD;
      with CML. The patient group under study would include all patients with chronic phase CML&#xD;
      having an HLA-identical sibling. In this protocol, eligible patients would be treated with an&#xD;
      allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant from an HLA identical or single HLA&#xD;
      antigen-mismatched family donor, using an intensive immunosuppressive regimen without&#xD;
      myeloablation (&quot;mini-transplant&quot;) in an attempt to decrease the transplant related toxicities&#xD;
      while preserving the anti-malignancy and/or anti-host marrow effect of the graft. The low&#xD;
      intensity non-myeloablative conditioning regimen should provide adequate immunosuppression to&#xD;
      allow stem cell and lymphocyte engraftment. T-cell replete, donor-derived, granulocyte colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) will be used to&#xD;
      establish hematopoietic and lymphoid reconstitution. We will add back lymphocytes in patients&#xD;
      with less than 100% donor T-cell chimerism in an attempt to prevent graft rejection and&#xD;
      enhance a graft-versus-malignancy effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is transplant related mortality (1 year survival). Other&#xD;
      end points include engraftment, degree of donor-host chimerism, incidence of acute and&#xD;
      chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), transplant related morbidity, as well as&#xD;
      disease-free and overall survival.&#xD;
