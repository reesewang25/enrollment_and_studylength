  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom pain refers to the sensation of pain felt by patients who have had a limb amputated.&#xD;
      The treatment of phantom pain is often disappointing and is unable to provide adequate relief&#xD;
      to the patients. The area of the brain involved (posterior parietal cortex [PPC]) is found on&#xD;
      the opposite side of the amputated limb. For example, if a patient has the right arm&#xD;
      amputated, the left posterior parietal cortex is involved in the phantom pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe that if they can decrease activity in the posterior parietal cortex they&#xD;
      may be able to reduce phantom pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers plan to use low frequency (1 Hz) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to&#xD;
      decrease the excitability of the PPC opposite the side of the amputated limb. TMS involves&#xD;
      the placement of a cooled electromagnet with a figure-eight coil on the patient's scalp and&#xD;
      turning on the magnetic flux. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of&#xD;
      the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). When an area of the brain is stimulated a period&#xD;
      follows when that area cannot be stimulated again. In this case, researchers plan to use TMS&#xD;
      to stimulate the PPC in order to decrease the level of excitability there.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phantom pain is a chronic painful condition that affects patients with amputations. Treatment&#xD;
      for phantom pain is often disappointing. In amputees, hyperexcitability of the posterior&#xD;
      parietal cortex area (PPC) contralateral to the side of the amputation has been linked with&#xD;
      the presence of phantom sensations. PPC is an area overactive in different forms of chronic&#xD;
      pain too. It is therefore conceivable that downregulation of activity in PPC could improve&#xD;
      phantom limb pain, a condition poorly responsive to available treatments. We have previously&#xD;
      demonstrated that low frequency TMS (1 Hz) results in decreased excitability of the&#xD;
      stimulated cortical regions. We plan to apply low-frequency TMS to PPC cortical areas&#xD;
      contralateral to the side of the amputated limb. We expect that this intervention will result&#xD;
      in amelioration of the phantom pain. Stimulation of the PPC area (target intervention) will&#xD;
      be compared with a control intervention in which TMS is directed slightly away from the head.&#xD;
