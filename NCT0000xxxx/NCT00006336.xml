      This study will examine the effectiveness of Braille reading as a sensory training program&#xD;
      for improving symptoms of focal (localized) dystonia, a movement disorder caused by sustained&#xD;
      muscle contractions. Musicians, writers, typists, athletes and others whose work involves&#xD;
      frequent repetitive movements may develop focal dystonia of the hand. Dystonia patients have&#xD;
      an impaired sense of touch, and it is thought that symptoms may improve with sensory tactile&#xD;
      (touch) training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with task-specific dystonia and healthy normal volunteers may be eligible for this&#xD;
      8-week study. Patients will undergo evaluation of their dystonia and a complete neurologic&#xD;
      examination. Healthy volunteers will have a complete physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of the study, after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks, all participants will have a&#xD;
      gap detection test for sensory perception testing. The test uses eight plastic devices called&#xD;
      JVP-Domes with ridges of different widths on the surface. The subject's arm and hand are held&#xD;
      in palm-up position and the right index finger is tested for about 1 second 20 times with&#xD;
      each dome. The subject is asked to report whether the direction of the dome is vertical or&#xD;
      horizontal. The test takes about 30 minutes. Patients with dystonia will also have a their&#xD;
      symptoms evaluated at these visits. The evaluation involves completing a written&#xD;
      questionnaire and writing a paragraph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be trained in Braille reading at NIH. Sessions will be given every day&#xD;
      the first week, twice a week the second and third weeks, and once a week the following weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been hypothesized that dystonia may be a sensory disorder. Animal studies as well as&#xD;
      physiological studies of patients with focal dystonia have demonstrated sensory dysfunction.&#xD;
      It has also been shown that patients with dystonia have impaired sensory perception including&#xD;
      when assessed with the JVP gap detection test. This could possibly result from enlargement&#xD;
      and dedifferentiation of representations in the sensory cortex. We therefore hypothesize that&#xD;
      sensory training could improve the impaired sensory perception and hence improve the&#xD;
      dystonia. This study will examine if Braille reading as a sensory training program can&#xD;
      correct the sensory perception and the dystonia. The primary outcome is improvement in the&#xD;
      JVP gap detection test.&#xD;
