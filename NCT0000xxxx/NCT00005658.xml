  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of the amino acid glycine in treating&#xD;
      psychotic disorders in children. The drug will be given as an adjunct (in addition) to the&#xD;
      patient's current antipsychotic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children age nine to 18 with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder whose symptoms began&#xD;
      before age 13 may be eligible for this 10-week study. Patients will be hospitalized during&#xD;
      the course of the trial. Weekend visits home may be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children enrolled in the study will be evaluated during a two-week pre-treatment period with&#xD;
      written tests for IQ and academic functioning and with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scan of the brain. For the MRI, the child lies on a table that slides into a large&#xD;
      donut-shaped machine with a strong magnetic field. This procedure produces images of the&#xD;
      brain that may help identify brain abnormalities in schizophrenia that develop in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the eight-week treatment phase, patients will receive glycine powder dissolved in&#xD;
      water once a day, in addition to their other antipsychotic medications. They will undergo the&#xD;
      following additional procedures during the course of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comprehensive psychiatric examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood pressure and pulse monitoring once a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood tests every other week - About one ounce of blood is drawn per week to measure&#xD;
           glycine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Eye movement study at week eight - Using a technique called infrared oculography,&#xD;
           special detectors measure infrared light reflected off the child's eyes while he or she&#xD;
           watches a moving square on a video monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) once during the study - About one-half ounce of&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord) is withdrawn&#xD;
           through a needle placed in the lower part of the spine for analysis of brain chemicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who respond well may continue to receive glycine treatment through their referring&#xD;
      physician after the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIMH will follow patients by phone every six months and with visits at two-year intervals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability of glycine to potentiate the NMDA receptor-complex, along with the fact that it&#xD;
      is well tolerated in short-and long-term administration, has raised the possibility that it&#xD;
      may provide an effective treatment of augmentation for neuroleptic-resistant negative&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia. Up to ten children and adolescents, ages 9-18, meeting DSM-IV&#xD;
      criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise&#xD;
      specified with onset of psychosis by age 12 who have failed at least two prior antipsychotics&#xD;
      entering this protocol on their current antipsychotic medication(s) will participate in an&#xD;
      open 8-week trial of adjunctive glycine therapy. In addition to the potential benefits, if&#xD;
      glycine therapy ameliorates enduring negative symptoms of schizophrenia, we anticipate that&#xD;
      recruiting these rare patients will be facilitated by the availability of this new treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide pilot data regarding the beneficial effects and safety of adjunctive&#xD;
      glycine therapy for children and adolescents with treatment refractory psychotic disorders.&#xD;
      The availability of newer alternate treatments is also important for recruitment of patients&#xD;
      in the broader study of the neurobiology and genetics of very early onset schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents ages nine to eighteen will be allowed into the study. Subjects&#xD;
      entering the protocol as new patients will be characterized by clinical phenomenology, eye&#xD;
      tracking, MRI brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and urinary biochemistry, and&#xD;
      chromosomal analysis. Patients with prominent mood symptoms who have required the addition of&#xD;
      mood stabilizing agents such as lithium or valproic acid will be allowed to remain on these&#xD;
      medications for the duration of the treatment trial, if clinically indicated. Liver&#xD;
      chemistries will be checked at baseline and at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All first-degree relatives are interviewed in person and undergo eye tracking measurement and&#xD;
      contribute blood cell lines as part of a genetic study of the cohort (84-M-0050).&#xD;
