      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with ifosfamide and&#xD;
      topotecan in treating patients with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated doses and sequence of topotecan and ifosfamide&#xD;
      that can be administered daily for 3 days on an every 4 week schedule in patients with&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors. II. Evaluate toxicity of topotecan and ifosfamide when administered&#xD;
      on this schedule in this patient population. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics related to&#xD;
      sequencing of topotecan and ifosfamide and the more efficacious, less toxic schedule of&#xD;
      treatment. IV. Assess the evidence of antineoplastic activity for this combination of agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive&#xD;
      ifosfamide at an initial fixed dose plus escalating doses of topotecan by 30 minute infusion&#xD;
      daily for 3 successive days. Cycle repeats every 28 days. After topotecan dosage is escalated&#xD;
      for a total of 3 dose levels, then ifosfamide dose is escalated by one dose level. The first&#xD;
      patient enrolled is treated with ifosfamide followed by topotecan for cycle 1, and for cycle&#xD;
      2 the order of drugs is reversed. The second patient is treated with the same drugs but with&#xD;
      topotecan administered before ifosfamide in the first cycle and then reversed in the second&#xD;
      cycle. From the third cycle onward, ifosfamide is followed by topotecan, but the first two&#xD;
      cycles continue to alternate with each subsequent patient entered. Filgrastim (granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) is given for all cycles on days 5-12 or until the absolute&#xD;
      granulocyte count has reached its nadir and recovered. If there is no dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) in a cohort, new patients are entered at the next highest dose level. If 1 of 3&#xD;
      patients at any level experiences DLT, an additional 3 patients are treated at that level&#xD;
      before proceeding to a higher level. If 2 or more patients experience DLT at any dose level,&#xD;
      the level immediately preceding that level is defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
      Three more patients are treated at the MTD to ensure that no DLT is experienced at that&#xD;
      level. After MTD is identified, 10 additional patients are accrued at that level. Patients&#xD;
      with minor response, stable disease, or symptomatic or marker improvement may continue on&#xD;
      treatment for up to 6 cycles. After 6 cycles, continuation on treatment is at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be a maximum of 24 patients accrued into this study over 8&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
