      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study followed healthy siblings of patients diagnosed with CHD before age 60. All&#xD;
      siblings underwent comprehensive risk factor screening and exercise thallium tomography to&#xD;
      identify occult CHD. Follow-up was performed from 6-15 years after entry (mean 8.7 years) to&#xD;
      determine the incidence of (1) acute coronary events (sudden death, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      and unstable angina) and (2) progression of occult CHD (repeat exercise thallium tomography).&#xD;
      Blood was obtained for genomic DNA, which was tested for polymorphisms of candidate genes&#xD;
      which may be associated with premature thrombotic CHD events (platelet proteins&#xD;
      GPIIB/IIIa[PlA1/A2 and Baka/b] and GPIbB, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme, angiotensinogen, D-fibrinogen, plasminogen activator-1, and&#xD;
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase). Plasma levels of proteins implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombotic CHD events were measured (fibrinogen,&#xD;
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tissue plasminogen activator, homocysteine, lipoprotein&#xD;
      (a), and apo(a) isoform size). DNA was also obtained from living probands and affected&#xD;
      siblings to use for genetic linkage studies using affected and unaffectedsibling pairs.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses examined (1) whether selected genetic polymorphisms were linked to the&#xD;
      occurrence of acute CHD events, and (2) to what extent traditional sociodemographic and&#xD;
      biological coronary risk factors or new genetic polymorphisms explained the progression of&#xD;
      occult CHD, or the transition from occult to symptomatic CHD events in families with&#xD;
      premature CHD.&#xD;
