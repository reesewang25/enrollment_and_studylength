      PRIMARY: To examine the safety and potential improvement in immune responses elicited by&#xD;
      combining rsgp120/HIV-1MN with the adjuvant QS-21. SECONDARY: To examine the role of alum in&#xD;
      the vaccine/adjuvant formulation; to determine the optimal dose ratio of vaccine to adjuvant;&#xD;
      and to obtain initial information on the optimal schedule of administration. AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      07/02/97: To determine the ability of immunization with rsgp120/HV-1MN in combination with&#xD;
      QS21 with or without alum to induce an HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity&#xD;
      (DTH) response in volunteers who undergo rsgp120/MN skin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune responses in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving subunit envelope vaccines formulated&#xD;
      with alum adjuvant suggest that functional antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 in vitro&#xD;
      may be induced, but the titers are relatively low in comparison to those measured in&#xD;
      individuals with natural HIV-1 infection. These limitations might be overcome by the addition&#xD;
      or substitution of a more suitable adjuvant such as QS-21.&#xD;

      Immune responses in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving subunit envelope vaccines formulated&#xD;
      with alum adjuvant suggest that functional antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 in vitro&#xD;
      may be induced, but the titers are relatively low in comparison to those measured in&#xD;
      individuals with natural HIV-1 infection. These limitations might be overcome by the addition&#xD;
      or substitution of a more suitable adjuvant such as QS-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are randomized to 20 treatment arms containing four patients each. rsgp120/HIV-1MN&#xD;
      is administered at four dose levels: 0, 100, 300, and 600 mcg, and QS-21 adjuvant is&#xD;
      administered at three dose levels: 0, 50, and 100 mcg. Some subject cohorts receive alum in&#xD;
      the vaccine formulation. Sixty volunteers receive injections at months 0, 1, and 10, and 20&#xD;
      volunteers receive injections at months 0, 1, and 6. AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: All&#xD;
      consenting volunteers who have received three immunizations will be tested for DTH response&#xD;
      to HIV-1 envelope with use of intradermal MN rsgp120. Follow-up is extended to 56 days after&#xD;
      administration of the intradermal injections.&#xD;
