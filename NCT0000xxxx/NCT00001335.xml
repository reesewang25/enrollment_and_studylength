  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for patients with metastatic Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESF),&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and neuroblastoma (NBL) remains dismal, with less than 25% long-term&#xD;
      disease-free survival. Though less grave, the prognosis for cure for other high-risk patients&#xD;
      is approximately 50%. New treatment strategies, including the identification of highly active&#xD;
      new agents, maximizing the dose intensity of the most active standard drugs, and the&#xD;
      development of improved methods of consolidation to eradicate microscopic residual disease,&#xD;
      are clearly needed to improve the outcome of these patients. This protocol will address these&#xD;
      issues by commencing with a Phase II window, for the highest risk patients, to evaluate a&#xD;
      series of promising drugs with novel mechanisms of action. All patients will then receive 5&#xD;
      cycles of dose-intensive &quot;best standard therapy&quot; with doxorubicin (adriamycin), vincristine,&#xD;
      and cyclophosphamide (VAdriaC). Patients at high risk of relapse will continue onto a phase I&#xD;
      consolidation regimen consisting of three cycles of dose-escalated Melphalan, Ifosfamide,&#xD;
      Mesna, and Etoposide (MIME). Peripheral blood stem cell transfusions (PBSCT) and recombinant&#xD;
      human G-CSF will be used as supportive care measures to allow maximal dose-escalation of this&#xD;
      combination regimen.&#xD;

        The patient must fall into one of the following diagnostic categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESF): Includes Ewing's sarcoma (classic, atypical,&#xD;
        extra-osseous), primitive sarcoma of bone, ectomesenchymoma, or peripheral primitive&#xD;
        neuroectodermal tumor (peripheral neuroepithelioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rhabdomyosarcoma: The patient must have either&#xD;
&#xD;
        High-risk arm: Metastatic disease at diagnosis (any site, any histology);&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        Moderate-risk arm: Incompletely resected ( Clinical Group III) Stage II tumors and ALL&#xD;
        stage III tumors (regardless of degree of surgical resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neuroblastoma: Any patient with metastatic disease at diagnosis (POG stage D or Evans'&#xD;
        stage IV); or, patients with loco-regional metastatic disease (POG stage C) or tumor&#xD;
        infiltrating across the midline (Evans' stage III) IF they have an elevated serum ferritin&#xD;
        (greater than 142 ng/ml), an amplified N-myc copy number (greater than 10 copies on&#xD;
        Southern analysis), or a DNA index of greater than 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must not have been previously treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be greater than or equal to 1 year of age but less than or equal to 25 years&#xD;
        of age. Patients weight must be greater than or equal to 15 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient (or his/her guardian if less than 18 years of age) must sign a document&#xD;
        indicating that he/she is aware of the investigational nature of this treatment protocol&#xD;
        and the potential risks and benefits that may be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potentially fertile female patients must have a documented negative urine or serum&#xD;
        pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a documented negative HIV serologic evaluation (Western Blot and/or&#xD;
        ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have abnormal cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction less&#xD;
        than 45% as measured by gated equilibrium radionuclide angiography [MUGA scan] and&#xD;
        confirmed by echocardiography).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have impaired renal function (serum creatinine greater than or equal to&#xD;
        twice the upper limit of normal for age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a total bilirubin of greater than 4.0 mg/dl (or a direct bilirubin of greater&#xD;
        than 2.0 mg/dl) or SGOT/SGPT greater than five times the upper limits of normal (NOT on the&#xD;
        basis of hepatic involvement by tumor) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a second malignancy following previous therapy will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients previously treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy (other than limited,&#xD;
        emergency radiation therapy) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are HIV-infected will be excluced.&#xD;
