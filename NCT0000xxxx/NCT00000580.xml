  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether hepatitis B immune globulin with a high level of antibody against the&#xD;
      hepatitis B antigen would be capable of interrupting maternal-fetal transmission of hepatitis&#xD;
      B virus, the single most important route of hepatitis spread in the entire Third World.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline study on the vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus in Taiwan revealed that 15&#xD;
      percent of all pregnant women were persistent carriers of hepatitis B antigen and that 40&#xD;
      percent of their new babies developed a protracted antigenemia during the first 6 months of&#xD;
      life. The incidence of acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatoma was high in Taiwan, and&#xD;
      patients with these disorders had a fivefold to sixfold higher prevalence of hepatitis B&#xD;
      antigen than healthy persons. Given the important public health problems of this disease in&#xD;
      Taiwan and the rest of the Third World, this trial sought to answer the important question of&#xD;
      whether hepatitis B immune globulin with a high level of antibody against the antigen would&#xD;
      be of utility in combating the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred and five babies were accepted into the study, which was actually conducted on&#xD;
      Taiwan through a contract to the Community Blood Council of Greater New York. Only those&#xD;
      babies born of mothers who had HBsAg complement fixation titers of 1:8 or greater were&#xD;
      included in these studies. At birth, blood was obtained from the mothers and cord blood from&#xD;
      the infants. Follow-up bloods were obtained from both the mother and baby when the infants&#xD;
      were 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of age. In addition, all household family contacts were&#xD;
      bled at least once during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind, fixed sample. A total of 205 neonates were assigned to treatment&#xD;
      with high-titer hepatitis B immune globulin, standard immune globulin, or albumin placebo&#xD;
      within 72 hours of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report (QVR)&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
