      To conduct a pilot study to determine whether lowering elevated serum cholesterol levels with&#xD;
      3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors reduced mortality due&#xD;
      to the sequelae of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in older men and women.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating levels of cholesterol, specifically cholesterol associated with the low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL) fraction, have been established by observational epidemiologic studies and&#xD;
      by metabolic, pathologic, genetic studies in humans and selected animal models, and by&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials as a major etiologic factor in coronary heart disease. The ratio&#xD;
      between the percent reduction in coronary heart disease incidence and the percent reduction&#xD;
      in cholesterol levels associated with treatment in randomized trials, approximately 2:1, is&#xD;
      almost exactly that predicted by numerous observational epidemiologic studies of this&#xD;
      relationship. However, the clinical trials demonstrating that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels&#xD;
      reduces subsequent incidence of coronary heart disease events have been confined by and large&#xD;
      to middle-aged men with hypercholesterolemia as in the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary&#xD;
      Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT) or to men with established coronary heart disease as in&#xD;
      the Coronary Drug Project (CDP). Experimental confirmation that cholesterol-lowering&#xD;
      treatment is worthwhile after as well as before age 60 is lacking. Thus, although the&#xD;
      guidelines issued in October 1987 by the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP)&#xD;
      Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults did&#xD;
      not discriminate explicitly by age, the absence of direct evidence of efficacy led them to&#xD;
      allow room for physician judgment in applying their recommendations to older patients. This&#xD;
      uncertainty in the application of the NCEP guidelines to older men and women is a matter of&#xD;
      considerable consequence to the public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic studies suggest that the prognostic power of cholesterol levels diminishes with&#xD;
      advancing age. Subdivision of the participants in several cohort studies into those above or&#xD;
      below age 50 at entry shows that the increment in coronary heart disease risk per increment&#xD;
      in total or LDL cholesterol level is nearly always substantially lower in the older group. In&#xD;
      the Framingham Heart Study, the study with the most follow-up data beyond age 60, a 0.5&#xD;
      percent increment in the coronary heart disease incidence rate was estimated per 1 mg/dl&#xD;
      increment in plasma cholesterol level -- about 60 percent of the increment seen in&#xD;
      middle-aged men and women. However, the absolute numbers of potentially preventable coronary&#xD;
      heart disease deaths, 80 percent of which occur after age 65, and myocardial infarctions&#xD;
      attributable to high plasma cholesterol levels in Framingham and other observational studies&#xD;
      appear to increase with increasing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been weakened by their limited&#xD;
      efficacy and acceptability to patients. In older patients, the administration of&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering drugs may be further complicated by interactions with drugs taken for&#xD;
      other more pressing conditions. However, since the Food and Drug Administration approved the&#xD;
      HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, in September 1987, the agent has been efficacious&#xD;
      and well-tolerated by patients of all ages, and has been used increasingly widely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1986, an ad hoc committee of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis, Hypertension, and Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee (AHLMAC) recommended a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial of cholesterol-lowering using an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor in the&#xD;
      elderly. The recommendation was endorsed by the full AHLMAC and approved by the National&#xD;
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council (NHLBAC) in May 1987. However, due to the high cost&#xD;
      of such a trial and concerns about feasibility, an initiative for a two-year pilot study at&#xD;
      five clinical centers was developed and approved by the NHLBAC in September 1988. The Request&#xD;
      for Applications was released in February 1989 and awards made in July 1990.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were five clinical centers and a coordinating center in the pilot study. There were&#xD;
      four pre-randomization visits at four to six week intervals. Subjects were eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion if their LDL cholesterol levels remained above 120 mg/dl after the introduction of&#xD;
      the American Heart Association Step 1 Diet at Visit 2. Subjects were randomized to diet plus&#xD;
      a low dosage of lovastatin (20 mg), diet plus a high dosage of lovastatin (40 mg), or to diet&#xD;
      plus a placebo. End points were changes in blood lipid levels. Data on other blood chemistry&#xD;
      values, as well as quality-of-life measures and coronary heart disease morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, were also collected. LDL cholesterol levels were measured at clinic visits six and&#xD;
      twelve weeks after randomization and at twelve week intervals thereafter. Serum alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase levels were measured at six week intervals to determine liver function and&#xD;
      slit lamp exams were performed before and after study medication to detect lenticular&#xD;
      opacities. Subjects were followed for a minimum of six months and a maximum of fifteen&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
