  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quantitative measurements of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction are useful in the&#xD;
      management of patients with heart disease. Several imaging methods exist, but are limited by&#xD;
      cost, invasiveness, or exposure to radio-isotopes. Conventional echocardiography is a&#xD;
      noninvasive method that allows estimation of left ventricular size and function; however,&#xD;
      quantitative measurements of volume are not widely used due to lack of reproducibility and&#xD;
      inaccurate measurements. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is a new technique that&#xD;
      can be used to derive volume measurements from a single image acquisition. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is an accurate method for making left&#xD;
      ventricular volume measurements. We therefore propose to measure left ventricular volumes&#xD;
      using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography in human subjects and correlate these&#xD;
      measurements with magnetic resonance imaging, a more accurate noninvasive method for&#xD;
      obtaining these measurements.&#xD;
