      Positron Emission Tomography (PET scanning) is performed using a total dose of less than 50&#xD;
      mRad per patient visit. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) is injected intravenously over 2 min.&#xD;
      Initial dynamic images will be obtained over the heart. Emission imaging will work from the&#xD;
      midcervical region down to the perineal region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CEA scanning, radiolabeled antibody, arcitumomab (IMMU-4), is injected intravenously over&#xD;
      5 min. A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) transmission scan is performed&#xD;
      over the same regions as the emission scans. Total dose from transmission scans should be no&#xD;
      more than 20 mRad per patient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients then undergo exploratory laparotomy performed by two surgeons, one blinded to the&#xD;
      results of the CEA-Scan and PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of all exploration, all identified disease is biopsied for pathologic&#xD;
      analysis and any resectable disease is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the second year, and then&#xD;
      after 3 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrences following resection for colorectal carcinoma occur in 50% of patients. Early&#xD;
      detection and management of recurrences results in improved survival. Post-operative&#xD;
      surveillance consists of serial CT scans, chest x-rays, colonoscopy and CEA determinations.&#xD;
      Elevations in the serum CEA level can be the earliest and most sensitive indicator of&#xD;
      recurrence. A rise in the serum CEA level in the absence of imageable disease presents a&#xD;
      particular diagnostic challenge. Advanced imaging modalities such as Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET) and anti-CEA antibody immunoscintigraphy have been proposed as a way of&#xD;
      localizing disease in these patients. This study will evaluate the sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      accuracy and predictive value of FDG-PET scans and anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy in patients&#xD;
      following resection of colorectal carcinoma who have rising serum CEA values in the absence&#xD;
      of imageable disease by conventional modalities. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      undergo FDG-PET scan and anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy followed by an exploratory laparotomy.&#xD;
      Abdominal explorations will be conducted by two surgeons, one of whom will be blinded to the&#xD;
      results of the FDG-PET and CEA scans. All suspicious lesions will be biopsied and if possible&#xD;
      resected. Results at operation will be correlated with the results of the scans. The goal of&#xD;
      the study is to determine the role of FDG-PET scanning and anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy in the&#xD;
      localization of recurrent colorectal carcinoma in patients with rising serum CEA levels.&#xD;

        All patients greater than 18 years old who have had a prior resection of colorectal cancer&#xD;
        and are suspected of having recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rising serum CEA levels greater than 6 on two successive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Resectable residual or recurrent disease. Patients in the occult arm (Arm 1) must have no&#xD;
        visible residual disease in the abdomen at the time of the last surgical exploration. In&#xD;
        addition, there must be no imageable definitive site of recurrent disease using&#xD;
        conventional imaging modalities including; CT scan of chest/ abdomen/ pelvis with contrast,&#xD;
        MRI scan, and chest x-ray. Patients in arm 2 may have a single site of recurrent or&#xD;
        metastatic disease which is resectable but in whom additional sites of disease are not&#xD;
        known and no imageable disease other than a solitary site of potentially resectable disease&#xD;
        is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to return to NIH for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to provide informed consent as demonstrated by the signed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be 2 or more months from abdominal or thoracic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with medical contraindication to abdominal exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with recurrent disease detected by conventional imaging studies as outlined&#xD;
        above. Metastatic disease localized outside of the abdominal cavity by conventional imaging&#xD;
        studies as outlined above. Patients must weigh less than 136 kgs. which is the weight limit&#xD;
        for the scanner tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with previous injection of murine monoclonal antibodies: Human anti-mouse assay&#xD;
        (HAMA) will be performed in patients with prior history of receiving murine monoclonal&#xD;
        antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients that are pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are HIV + will be excluded.&#xD;
