      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous thromboembolism is associated with more than 300,000 hospitalizations and results in&#xD;
      thousands of deaths annually. Conventional therapy consists of intravenous heparin followed&#xD;
      by oral anticoagulants usually given for three to six months. The recommended intensity of&#xD;
      oral anticoagulants (warfarin) has been derived from clinical trials. Such therapy is usually&#xD;
      quite effective. However, some patients develop recurrent disease after the oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants are stopped. A recent randomized study evaluated the optimal duration of oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy. After acute treatment with heparin, subjects were treated with oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants for either six weeks or six months with a target INR * of 2 to 2.85. There was&#xD;
      no difference in mortality in the two groups. Recurrence was not seen while the patients were&#xD;
      under treatment. When anticoagulants were stopped, recurrent thrombosis was documented in 18&#xD;
      percent of the patients treated for six weeks and in 9.5 percent of those treated for six&#xD;
      months. The period of greatest risk of recurrence for the six weeks patients was immediately&#xD;
      after therapy was stopped. There was a linear increase in cumulative risk of 5 to 6 percent&#xD;
      per year for both treatment groups during the following 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have experienced idiopathic venous thrombosis, the risk of recurrence may&#xD;
      continue even after several months of conventional therapy. Further prophylactic therapy&#xD;
      might be beneficial for the patients who are at risk for late recurrence. But, because of the&#xD;
      presumed risk of bleeding and inconvenience of monitoring standard warfarin therapy, most&#xD;
      physicians usually limit treatment to three to six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1997, Simioni showed a cumulative recurrence rate of VTE of 39.7 percent among those with&#xD;
      factor V Leiden mutation, with all recurrences occurring within three years, a rate 2.4 times&#xD;
      higher than among individuals without the mutation. The factor V Leiden mutation is found in&#xD;
      4 to 6 percent of Caucasians and is the single most important cause of thromboembolism in a&#xD;
      variety of conditions. Heterozygous carriers with the mutation have VTE at a younger age than&#xD;
      do noncarriers. Among those with first VTE, the prevalence of the mutation is 15 to 40&#xD;
      percent and among those with a family history of VTE, as high as 50 percent. However, in a&#xD;
      large study of men participating in the Physicians Health Study, those individuals with the&#xD;
      mutation had an increased rate of VTE over time. These age-specific incidence rate&#xD;
      differences ranged from 1.23 to 5.97 in those aged 70 or older. These data suggest that&#xD;
      confounders other than genetic predisposition are important in the development of VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * The INR or international normalized ratio is the ratio of patient prothrombin to control&#xD;
      prothrombin multiplied by the international sensitivity index. The INR was introduced by the&#xD;
      World Health Organization to standardize control of anticoagulant therapy internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. A total of 253 patients were&#xD;
      randomized to usual care plus placebo and a total of 255 patients to usual care plus a&#xD;
      three-to-four year regimen of low-dose warfarin (target INR 1.5 to 2.0), which after initial&#xD;
      titration required infrequent outpatient monitoring. Double-blind INR assessment and dose&#xD;
      adjustment were performed every three months to ensure patient safety and to monitor&#xD;
      compliance. Primary endpoints included recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding&#xD;
      episodes, and all-cause mortality. Separate analysis was performed of all-cause mortality in&#xD;
      the total patient population and in those with factor V Leiden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of 52 clinical centers, a laboratory coordinating center, the clinical&#xD;
      coordinating center, and the data coordinating center.&#xD;
