      RATIONALE: Cryosurgery for liver metastases may have fewer side effects and improve recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cryosurgery for patients with&#xD;
      unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the feasibility of conducting a multi-institutional clinical study of&#xD;
      cryosurgery for liver metastases. II. Evaluate the morbidity and mortality of cryosurgery for&#xD;
      liver metastases when applied in a multi-institutional setting. III. Evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      cryosurgery for liver metastases as measured by total liver control, local lesion control,&#xD;
      and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-institutional study. Patients are first confirmed by exploratory&#xD;
      laparotomy to have no extrahepatic metastases. They then undergo biopsy of the portal lymph&#xD;
      node, after which, full mobilization of liver is recommended. Cholecystectomy is optional but&#xD;
      recommended for treatment of tumors adjacent to the gallbladder. After mapping out the&#xD;
      location and size of the metastatic tumor by ultrasound, cryoablation of the metastases is&#xD;
      carried out. Cryoablation involves the delivery of nitrogen through metallic probes placed&#xD;
      surgically into the center of the liver metastases. There are two freeze and thaw cycles for&#xD;
      each lesion with synchronous intraoperative ultrasound monitoring of the cryoablation. One&#xD;
      centimeter margin of cryoablation is determined by this ultrasound image. Treatment of the&#xD;
      liver with regional chemotherapy is not allowed until radiographic and pathologic&#xD;
      confirmation of disease progression in the liver. Follow-up is at 3 weeks after surgery and&#xD;
      then every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be a maximum of 45 patients accrued in approximately 3 years&#xD;
      for this study. This is a two stage accrual design in which 17 patients are first accrued of&#xD;
      which 15 should be eligible. If fewer than 11 of the initial 15 eligible patients show no&#xD;
      evidence of disease at 3 months, the study stops and treatment is abandoned. If at least 11&#xD;
      patients show no evidence of disease, then 28 additional patients are accrued.&#xD;
