    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug, interferon gamma, in&#xD;
      treating leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD I). Patients with this inherited immune&#xD;
      disorder do not have enough proteins called adhesion molecules on their infection-fighting&#xD;
      white blood cells, impairing the ability of these cells to get to the site of infection. As a&#xD;
      result, patients have recurrent infections of soft tissues, such as the skin, gums and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, and poor wound healing. Infants with severe LAD I often die from&#xD;
      multiple infections. Interferon gamma may increase the number of adhesion molecules on white&#xD;
      blood cells, and thus improve their function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with LAD I who weigh more than 13 kilograms (28.5 pounds) may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will have personal and family medical histories taken, a physical&#xD;
      examination, blood and urine tests and a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive injections of interferon gamma under the skin 3 times a week for 3&#xD;
      months. Adult patients will be taught how to give their own injections (similar to insulin&#xD;
      injections for diabetes) and parents will be taught how to administer the shots to their&#xD;
      child. Blood samples, usually be between 30 to 90 milliliters (2 to 6 tablespoons), will be&#xD;
      drawn just before starting medication and again 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 4 months&#xD;
      after therapy begins. At these same time intervals, patients will provide a salt-water mouth&#xD;
      rinse specimen, which will be tested for changes in the number of white blood cells during&#xD;
      interferon gamma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for inpatient evaluations at the start&#xD;
      of therapy and again after 1 week, 1month, 3 months and 4 months. The initial screening visit&#xD;
      will take a few days and subsequent visits will take 1 to 2 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD I) is a primary immunodeficiency disease resulting&#xD;
      from mutations in the gene encoding CD18. Markedly reduced or absent expression of the&#xD;
      leukocyte integrin component CD18 causes significant impairment in leukocyte mobilization to&#xD;
      inflammatory sites. Clinically, patients have marked leukocytosis and recurrent infections&#xD;
      involving soft tissues such as skin, the gastrointestinal tract and gingiva. Death due to&#xD;
      infections in early infancy is common with the severe form of LAD I (CD18 expression less&#xD;
      than 0.5%), but patients with the moderate phenotype (CD18 expression 1-10%) may survive into&#xD;
      young adulthood. To date, therapy consists of antibiotic treatment for infections and bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation when possible. LAD I is also a candidate for future gene therapy.&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown that in vivo administration of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)&#xD;
      upregulates CD18 expression in normals and alters leukocyte trafficking. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      modest increases in CD18 expression in LAD I patients with the moderate phenotype or&#xD;
      alterations in CD18 independent trafficking could result in detectable clinical changes and&#xD;
      possible clinical improvement.&#xD;
