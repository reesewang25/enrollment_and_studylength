      To test hypotheses related to gender differences in cardiovascular mortality trends between&#xD;
      1980 and 1991 in two southeastern New England communities which were part of the Pawtucket&#xD;
      Heart Health Program.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pawtucket Heart Health Program was a community-based research and demonstration project&#xD;
      in cardiovascular disease prevention in the town of Pawtucket, Rhode Island and in the&#xD;
      non-intervention comparison town of New Bedford, Massachusetts. The study was initiated by&#xD;
      the NHLBI in August, 1980. See also Study 1022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were four major areas of analysis: 1) gender differences in trends from 1980 to 1991 in&#xD;
      total event rates, hospital discharge rates, in-hospital case-fatality and out of hospital&#xD;
      deaths for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke; 2) gender specific analyses of&#xD;
      methodological issues which may affect the interpretation of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      surveillance data; 3) gender differences in the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of CHD&#xD;
      and stroke which may influence morbidity and mortality trends; and 4) gender differences in&#xD;
      the association between population trends in risk factors and morbidity and mortality trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted using morbidity and mortality data collected by the Pawtucket Heart&#xD;
      Health Program between 1980 and 1993, and risk factor data obtained through biennial&#xD;
      cross-sectional household health surveys conducted in random samples of residents in the two&#xD;
      study communities. Morbidity and mortality data were obtained according to standardized&#xD;
      epidemiologic surveillance methods. Hospitalized cases of coronary heart disease and stroke&#xD;
      were identified through hospital discharge records and were validated using a standardized&#xD;
      diagnostic algorithm based on data abstracted from medical records. Out-of-hospital deaths&#xD;
      identified through death certificate data were validated using an algorithm based upon&#xD;
      medical history data and information concerning the circumstances of death obtained from&#xD;
      informant interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender specific trends in both age-adjusted and age specific morbidity and mortality were&#xD;
      compared. Trends in rates estimated from events classified according to ICD-9 discharge and&#xD;
      death certificate codes were contrasted with those estimated from cases validated by&#xD;
      standardized diagnostic algorithms. Data regarding circumstances of death and in-hospital&#xD;
      treatment were assessed in relation to potential influences on morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      trends. Absolute changes over time and average annual percent change over time were evaluated&#xD;
      using linear and log-linear regression regression techniques. Other analytic methods included&#xD;
      logistic regression and analysis of variance. Expected annual event rates in men and women&#xD;
      were estimated from risk factor data using equations based upon accelerated failure time&#xD;
      Weibull models, and the impact of risk factors on mortality rates was assessed by comparing&#xD;
      predicted with actual rates.&#xD;
