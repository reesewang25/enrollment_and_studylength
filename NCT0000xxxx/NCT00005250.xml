  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To screen by electrocardiography the entire population of 1,400 individuals in seven Amish&#xD;
      Mennonite communities in order to perform genetic linkage studies of long QT syndrome (LQTS).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LQTS is a severe heart disorder leading to sudden death due to ventricular tachycardia or&#xD;
      ventricular fibrillation. The syndrome segregated as a Mendelian recessive in the highly&#xD;
      inbred population under study and resulted in the sudden death of several members of the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire population was screened to identify cases of LQTS. In addition, 29 obligate&#xD;
      heterozygotes were studied by 24-hour Holter monitoring to determine whether these gene&#xD;
      carriers had any subtle phenotypes. The data were subjected to complex segregation and&#xD;
      linkage analysis to establish the mode of inheritance and penetrance of LQTS.&#xD;
