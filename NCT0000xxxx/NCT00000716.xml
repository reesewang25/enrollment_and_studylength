  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of oral zidovudine (AZT) when given over a period of 24&#xD;
      weeks to children between 3 months and 12 years of age. The effectiveness of AZT in treating&#xD;
      HIV infection in infants and children will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infection in children is most often associated with symptomatic disease and poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Treatment with antiviral therapy may be effective in altering the course of the&#xD;
      disease and decreasing mortality in these children. AZT has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. It is therefore likely that infected&#xD;
      children may also benefit from this treatment.&#xD;

      HIV infection in children is most often associated with symptomatic disease and poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Treatment with antiviral therapy may be effective in altering the course of the&#xD;
      disease and decreasing mortality in these children. AZT has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. It is therefore likely that infected&#xD;
      children may also benefit from this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants receive AZT mixed with juice at a dose dependent on body size every 6 hours&#xD;
      for 24 weeks. The children are evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks, every two weeks for&#xD;
      the subsequent 8 weeks, and monthly thereafter. Blood samples are collected periodically and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture on 2 occasions.&#xD;
