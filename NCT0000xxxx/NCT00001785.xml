  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HTLV stands for human T cell leukemia virus. HTLV-1 is a virus that attacks specific kinds of&#xD;
      white blood cells called T cells. T cells are part of the natural defense system of the body.&#xD;
      HTLV-1 has been associated with leukemia and lymphoma. In addition, approximately 1% of all&#xD;
      patients infected with HTLV-1 develops a condition known as HTLV-1 associated myelopathy&#xD;
      (HAM) / tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no clearly defined, effective treatment for patients with HAM/TSP.&#xD;
      Steroids have been used as therapy but have only been able to provide temporary relief of&#xD;
      symptoms. Human interferon is a small protein released from different kinds of cells in the&#xD;
      body. Interferon has been known to have antiviral and immunological effects and has been used&#xD;
      to treat hepatitis and multiple sclerosis. Interferon Beta is released from cells called&#xD;
      fibroblasts. These cells play a role in the production of connective tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible role of recombinant interferon beta&#xD;
      (Avonex) in treatment of HAM/TSP. The study is broken into three phases, a pre-treatment&#xD;
      phase, a treatment phase, and a post-treatment phase. The total duration of the study will be&#xD;
      44 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will receive injections of Avonex 1 to 2 times a week.&#xD;
      Throughout the study patients will regularly submit blood samples and undergo diagnostic&#xD;
      tests such as MRI and measures of somatosensory evoked potentials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HTLV-1 has been linked to a chronic, slowly progressive neurologic condition termed HTLV-1&#xD;
      associated spastic paraparesis or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) which affects about&#xD;
      1% of the infected individuals. The disease is thought to be due to a T cell viral induced&#xD;
      immunopathological process. A high frequency of HTLV-1 specific CD8 T cells are found in&#xD;
      patients with HAM/TSP. The immune system of patients infected with HTLV-1 appears to be&#xD;
      dysregulated, and increased spontaneous T cell proliferation can be demonstrated in vitro.&#xD;
      This is in part due to continuous antigenic stimulation and due to transactivation by the&#xD;
      HTLV-1 encoded Tax protein of host immunomodulatory genes such as CD80, CD86, IL-2 and its&#xD;
      receptor. In addition, an increased viral load has been demonstrated in symptomatic&#xD;
      individuals compared to asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. It is thought that the local immune&#xD;
      response to the virus within the central nervous system plays a role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      progressive spastic encephalomyeloneuropathy of HAM/TSP. Therefore, reduction of spontaneous&#xD;
      T cell proliferation and viral replication, as well as decrease of the compromise of the&#xD;
      blood brain barrier may ameliorate the immune-mediated component of the process which leads&#xD;
      to inflammatory destruction of nervous tissue in HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no clearly defined, effective treatment of patients with HAM/TSP.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy but provide mostly only transient symptomatic&#xD;
      relief. Treatment with human interferon has been shown to improve acute and chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      through its anti-viral and cytostatic effects. Further, patients with relapsing-remitting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, a disease thought to be at least in part a T cell mediated,&#xD;
      immunopathological process, exhibit a marked reduction of the frequency of new lesion&#xD;
      formation while on this medication. This latter effect may in part be explained by an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect of interferon which allows repair of the blood brain barrier. To&#xD;
      evaluate possible role interferon beta in the treatment of HAM/TSP, we studied its effect on&#xD;
      induction on regulatory factors and spontaneous in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood&#xD;
      lymphocytes (PBLs) from HTLV-I infected individuals. Recombinant interferon beta-1b inhibited&#xD;
      spontaneous proliferation of PBLs from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and patients with HAM/TSP&#xD;
      in a dose dependent manner and induced expression of interferon regulatory factor-2 which is&#xD;
      associated with down regulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma. These&#xD;
      preliminary results indicate that treatment with interferon-b may ameliorate the immune&#xD;
      dysregulation induced by HTLV-1 and may have therapeutic effect in the treatment of HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve patients will be treated with administration of recombinant human interferon-beta1a.&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy will be based on reduction of spontaneous proliferation and proviral&#xD;
      load. As a secondary measure the clinical response of patients will be evaluated. The study&#xD;
      will entail an 8-week pretreatment period, a 28-week treatment phase with escalation of the&#xD;
      interferon-beta1a dose, and a 12-week post-treatment phase. In cases where dose escalation&#xD;
      leads to intolerable side-effects, patients will be continued at the highest tolerated dose&#xD;
      of medication. Spontaneous proliferation, viral load, and clinical parameters will be&#xD;
      determined monthly.&#xD;
