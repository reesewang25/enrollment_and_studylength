  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This screening protocol is designed to evaluate patients for participation in clinical&#xD;
      studies in the Gene Therapy and Therapeutics Branch (GTTB) of the National Institute of&#xD;
      Dental and Craniofacial Research. To participate, patients must meet the specific&#xD;
      requirements of at least one of the available research studies; this protocol serves as a&#xD;
      first step for admitting patients to an appropriate program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with diagnosed or undiagnosed conditions may participate in this screening protocol.&#xD;
      They will undergo procedures that may include questionnaires, a physical examination, routine&#xD;
      laboratory tests, and diagnostic imaging or radiological studies. Eligibility screening will&#xD;
      be limited to three visits within 12 months of entry into the protocol. If an appropriate&#xD;
      study is not found by the end of this time, the candidate's participation in the screening&#xD;
      program will terminate. No experimental treatments are offered under the screening protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are found eligible for a current GTTB study will be notified of their options&#xD;
      and invited to enroll.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to screen patients with either diagnosed or undiagnosed conditions,&#xD;
      and provides for determining eligibility for approved protocols within the Gene Therapy and&#xD;
      Therapeutics Branch (GTTB), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. The&#xD;
      purpose of the protocol is to allow evaluation of patients who do not meet the requirements&#xD;
      for other screening protocols, such as the screening protocol for Sjogren's syndrome&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be evaluated to determine whether they are suitable candidates for&#xD;
      inclusion in any protocols in the GTTB. The screening evaluation will include past and&#xD;
      current medical history, and an appropriate physical examination. Further routine diagnostic&#xD;
      tests may also be performed to determine eligibility for approved studies. The tests and&#xD;
      procedures are of minimal risk. When the screening has been completed, subjects will be&#xD;
      informed of the options available at the time for participation in available, approved&#xD;
      research protocols.&#xD;
