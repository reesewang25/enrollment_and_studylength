      This study will evaluate healthy normal volunteers and patients with a variety of endocrine&#xD;
      disorders to 1) learn more about conditions that affect the endocrine glands (glands that&#xD;
      secrete hormones) and 2) train physicians in endocrinology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with endocrine-related conditions and healthy volunteers of all ages may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a physical examination medical and history. They may be required&#xD;
      to provide blood, saliva or urine samples and undergo ultrasound (using sound waves) or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (using a magnetic field) imaging to visualize internal body structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some healthy adult volunteers will have hormone-stimulating tests to assess endocrine&#xD;
      function. These tests measure blood hormone levels before and after injection of a synthetic&#xD;
      form of a hormone. A device called a heparin lock, through which the hormone is injected and&#xD;
      the blood samples are collected, is placed in a vein in the arm or hand. Blood samples are&#xD;
      drawn before the hormone is injected and at various intervals after the injection to measure&#xD;
      levels of the hormone. These tests, which last from 1 to 3 hours, may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CRH stimulation test corticotropin-releasing hormone is given to test pituitary and&#xD;
           adrenal gland function&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ACTH stimulation test adrenocorticotrophic hormone is given to test adrenal gland&#xD;
           function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. LHRH stimulation test luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone is given to test pituitary&#xD;
           gland function&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. TRH stimulation test thyroid-releasing hormone is given to test pituitary and thyroid&#xD;
           gland function&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. GHRH stimulation test growth hormone releasing hormone is given to measure growth&#xD;
           hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oral glucose tolerance test, which is similar to the stimulation tests, may also be done&#xD;
      to measure blood glucose (sugar) and insulin levels after drinking a sugary liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with a hereditary endocrine disorder and their family members&#xD;
      may also be asked to provide a blood sample for genetic studies of inherited endocrine&#xD;
      disorders. Patients with endocrine-related disorders may be offered medical or surgical&#xD;
      treatment for their disorder.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed to allow endocrine-related evaluations of healthy subjects and&#xD;
      patients with a variety of endocrine disorders. Healthy subjects may be studied to obtain&#xD;
      normative data for endocrine tests involving blood, urine, saliva, ultrasound and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance examinations. If not eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, patients with&#xD;
      endocrine-related conditions may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance&#xD;
      the clinical skills of physicians participating in NICHD clinical research and training&#xD;
      programs, and to provide stimuli for new clinical research initiatives. Standard,&#xD;
      medically-indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a&#xD;
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the patient will receive&#xD;
      medical or surgical treatment for their disorder, according to current clinical practice. The&#xD;
      overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to support our clinical&#xD;
      training and research missions.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects and patients with endocrine-related conditions of all ages are eligible&#xD;
        for this protocol. The actual selection of patients most appropriate for clinical training&#xD;
        needs will be made by protocol investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with disabilities are not formally excluded from the study unless the disability&#xD;
        would specifically prevent their participation. If a subject with cognitive impairment&#xD;
        wishes to participate, there must be available a family member or other qualified&#xD;
        individual holding a durable power of attorney who is able to guide the impaired subject s&#xD;
        participation and be an advocate for their interests. This participation is limited to the&#xD;
        non-research, clinical training arm of the study.&#xD;
