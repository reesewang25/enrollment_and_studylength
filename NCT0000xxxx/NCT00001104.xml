    <textblock>
      Study A: To determine whether treatment with zidovudine (ZDV) will delay or change the&#xD;
      disease process in hemophilic patients who have HIV infection with no symptoms. The major&#xD;
      clinical question is whether patients who receive chronic ZDV therapy will have a delay in&#xD;
      the development of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). The pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of&#xD;
      ZDV in hemophilic patients will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: To determine if ZDV therapy changes the risk of a hemophiliac transmitting HIV to&#xD;
      his wife or other female sexual partner. To determine the effectiveness of counseling and&#xD;
      education on the behaviors of the wives that place them at risk for HIV infection. To&#xD;
      determine if antibodies to HIV either appear or disappear from the blood of any of the wives&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A: Individuals who are infected with HIV can benefit from therapy with an effective&#xD;
      anti-AIDS virus agent. ZDV is a potent inhibitor of HIV in vitro (test tube) and is safe in&#xD;
      humans at the dose planned. It may be effective in preventing the development of AIDS or ARC&#xD;
      in hemophiliacs who have the HIV antibody in their blood. The pharmacokinetic studies are&#xD;
      especially important because the high prevalence of hepatic disease in this population may&#xD;
      affect the metabolism and blood levels of ZDV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: HIV is transmitted by sexual contact, and wives of infected hemophilic patients have&#xD;
      become infected during long-term sexual relationships. Transmission of the virus does not&#xD;
      occur during casual family contact. This study will aid in determining if therapy influences&#xD;
      the transmission of HIV, because the wives of hemophiliacs generally have no risk for HIV&#xD;
      infection other than sexual contact with their spouse.&#xD;

      Study A: Individuals who are infected with HIV can benefit from therapy with an effective&#xD;
      anti-AIDS virus agent. ZDV is a potent inhibitor of HIV in vitro (test tube) and is safe in&#xD;
      humans at the dose planned. It may be effective in preventing the development of AIDS or ARC&#xD;
      in hemophiliacs who have the HIV antibody in their blood. The pharmacokinetic studies are&#xD;
      especially important because the high prevalence of hepatic disease in this population may&#xD;
      affect the metabolism and blood levels of ZDV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: HIV is transmitted by sexual contact, and wives of infected hemophilic patients have&#xD;
      become infected during long-term sexual relationships. Transmission of the virus does not&#xD;
      occur during casual family contact. This study will aid in determining if therapy influences&#xD;
      the transmission of HIV, because the wives of hemophiliacs generally have no risk for HIV&#xD;
      infection other than sexual contact with their spouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A: Patients selected for the study are randomly assigned to placebo (inactive&#xD;
      medication) or ZDV taken every 4 hours while the patient is awake for a total of 5 doses per&#xD;
      day. The patient's immune function and clinical condition are monitored with periodic virus&#xD;
      cultures, p24 antigen assays, estimates of lymphocyte type and numbers, cell surface markers,&#xD;
      and frequent clinical evaluations to see if these are markers of drug efficacy. Patients&#xD;
      continue on their regimen until the final analysis of the data, which could occur up to 3&#xD;
      years after the last patient is entered into the study. Amendment: Based on data from ACTG&#xD;
      019 this protocol has been closed to further accrual. All patients entered in this study will&#xD;
      be unblinded as to treatment received. Patients will be informed of results of ACTG 019 and&#xD;
      be requested to sign a modified statement of consent approved by the local Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board. All patients currently receiving study therapy will be offered open-label ZDV.&#xD;
      Patients temporarily discontinued from study therapy at this time will be offered open-label&#xD;
      ZDV when toxicity resolves (less than or equal to Grade 2 hemoglobin or neutrophil toxicity,&#xD;
      less than or equal to Grade 1 all other toxicities). Patients who have been permanently&#xD;
      discontinued from study therapy will not be eligible for open-label ZDV through this&#xD;
      protocol. Modification of dose is recommended, however, patients who elect to continue&#xD;
      current dose of ZDV after being informed of results of ACTG 019 will be allowed to do so. All&#xD;
      patients enrolled in this study will continue to be followed until termination of this study.&#xD;
      Above amendment added 11/01/89.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: The wife or other female sexual partner is interviewed once at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and again when Study A is completed. The interview takes about 10 minutes and includes&#xD;
      questions about the couple's sexual activity to help define the risk of becoming infected&#xD;
      with HIV. In addition, blood is drawn to test for antibodies to HIV. The questionnaire and&#xD;
      blood sample will be repeated at the time the patient is switched from blinded study therapy&#xD;
      to open-label ZDV. (AMENDED 11/01/89) The results of the blood test are given to the person&#xD;
      being tested. Information about the transmission of HIV and counseling are provided. It is&#xD;
      recommended that the wife abstain from sexual contact with her husband, but if she does not,&#xD;
      the use of condoms or condoms plus a spermicide is recommended. The decision about the type&#xD;
      of precautions to take does not influence the opportunity to participate in the study.&#xD;
