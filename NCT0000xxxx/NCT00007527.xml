      The CS 1018 study will recruit a total of 600 patients seeking treatment for opiate&#xD;
      dependence. They will be recruited from six states (Florida, New York, Texas, California,&#xD;
      Washington, and Illinois), with up to ten private physician sites or clinics participating in&#xD;
      each state. Coordination of the participating sites and clinics in each of the six states&#xD;
      will be performed from an associated Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Tampa&#xD;
      VAMC, New York City VAMC, San Antonio VAMC, Long Beach VAMC, Seattle VAMC, and Hines VAMC).&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator (PI) at each of the six VAMC?s will be a physician experienced in&#xD;
      the treatment of opiate dependent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by any of numerous strategies including word of mouth,&#xD;
      self-referral, local fliers, newspapers, and radio advertisements. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted open label with no random assignment or stratification. Patients may be accepted&#xD;
      for detoxification or longer-term treatment (6 to 12 months of buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
      therapy). Patients under the age of 21 will initially be admitted for detoxification; longer&#xD;
      treatment of these patients will be based on physician judgement of the necessary of&#xD;
      continued treatment. Patients will be inducted directly into buprenorphine/naloxone 4:1&#xD;
      combination tablets. Patients treated in private practice will be asked to sign a treatment&#xD;
      contract which will delineate the terms and conditions of treatment.&#xD;

      Primary Hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of a sublingual&#xD;
      tablet formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone by extending the combination tablet&#xD;
      availability to physicians in office-based practice. The general consensus is that the&#xD;
      initial effort should involve physicians experienced in the treatment of opiate dependence.&#xD;
      The fact that buprenorphine is already in a formulation available as a schedule V analgesic&#xD;
      should allow for its administration in and dispensing from a physician's office. The research&#xD;
      data showing its high level of safety, patient acceptance and clinical efficacy, and its&#xD;
      availability as a formulation that can be given for take-home dosing with low intravenous&#xD;
      abuse liability, argue compellingly for exploring alternative implementation strategies in&#xD;
      settings other than traditional narcotic treatment programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: This is a single treatment study of a sublingual 4:1 buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
      combination tablet. Dosing can range from 2 mg at baseline (expressed as amount of&#xD;
      buprenorphine) to 24 mg (maximum dose used in study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: Patient retention rate, percentage of urine samples negative for opiates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Abstract: The CS 1018 study recruited a total of 582 patients seeking treatment for&#xD;
      opiate dependence. They were recruited from six states (Florida, New York, Texas, California,&#xD;
      Washington, and Illinois), with up to ten private physician sites or clinics participating in&#xD;
      each state. Coordination of the participating sites and clinics in each of the six states was&#xD;
      performed from an associated Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Tampa VAMC, New&#xD;
      York City VAMC, San Antonio VAMC, Long Beach VAMC, Seattle VAMC, and Hines VAMC). The&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (PI) at each of the six VAMC's was a physician experienced in the&#xD;
      treatment of opiate dependent patients. In addition, a study coordinator was hired at each of&#xD;
      the six VAMC's to coordinate both the collection and completion of study forms. Editing and&#xD;
      correction of all data study case report forms was coordinated and handled by one of the&#xD;
      state specific study coordinators. Patients were recruited by any of numerous strategies&#xD;
      including utilization of central recruiting telephone number systems, word of mouth,&#xD;
      self-referral, local fliers, newspapers, and radio advertisements. This study was conducted&#xD;
      open label with no random assignment or stratification. Patients were accepted for&#xD;
      detoxification or longer-term treatment (6 to 12 months of buprenorphine/naloxone therapy).&#xD;
      Patients under the age of 21 were initially admitted for detoxification; longer treatment of&#xD;
      these patients was based on physician judgement of the necessary of continued treatment.&#xD;
      Patients were inducted directly into buprenorphine/naloxone 4:1 combination tablets. Patients&#xD;
      treated in private practice were asked to sign a treatment contract which delineated the&#xD;
      terms and conditions of treatment.&#xD;
