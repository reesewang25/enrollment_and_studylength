      RATIONALE: STI571 may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and may be effective&#xD;
      treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of STI571 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of STI571 in patients with accelerated phase Philadelphia&#xD;
      chromosome positive (or chromosome negative and Bcr/Abl positive) chronic myelogenous&#xD;
      leukemia. II. Determine the rate of hematological response to this treatment in these&#xD;
      patients. III. Determine the improvements in symptomatic parameters with this treatment in&#xD;
      these patients. IV. Determine the cytogenetic response to this treatment in these patients.&#xD;
      V. Determine the time to treatment failure in these patients after receiving this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral STI571 daily. Treatment continues for at least 1 year in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are considered to have&#xD;
      benefited may continue treatment beyond 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
