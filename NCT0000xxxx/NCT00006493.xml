  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the effects of rosiglitazone, a drug usually taken&#xD;
      for Type II diabetes, on HIV-associated hyperlipidemia. HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a&#xD;
      medical condition characterized by gradual changes in the distribution of body fat. The body&#xD;
      fat located in the extremities and face disappears while body fat around the abdomen and&#xD;
      upper back increases. Certain biochemical changes occur in association with these changes in&#xD;
      fat distribution. Lipid levels particularly serum triglycerides are increased. HDL, the &quot;good&#xD;
      cholesterol&quot; is decreased. Higher than normal level of insulin or insulin resistance is also&#xD;
      found in this condition. This latter condition is one of the hallmarks of Type II diabetes.&#xD;
      The protease inhibitors, a class of HIV medications, are associated with the occurrence of&#xD;
      HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It has been suggested that a biochemical pathway known as the&#xD;
      peripheral peroxisomal activating receptor (PPAR) gamma system is blocked leading to the&#xD;
      onset of this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosiglitazone is a new drug approved by the FDA in 1999 for the treatment of type II&#xD;
      diabetes. It lowers blood sugar by improving insulin resistance, which as mentioned before,&#xD;
      is the hallmark of Type II diabetes. It has also been noted to improve blood lipid levels.&#xD;
      Rosiglitazone works by stimulating the PPAR gamma system. It is hoped that this drug can turn&#xD;
      on the PPAR system and reverse the HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome.&#xD;
