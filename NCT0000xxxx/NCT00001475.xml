      Patients enrolled in NIH protocol 95-I-0133 at the Clinical Center may participate in an&#xD;
      extension phase of this study in which the drug prednisone will be eliminated from the&#xD;
      treatment regimen. Prednisone is associated with avascular necrosis, a condition that has&#xD;
      been found in a number of patients in this study. Also, certain patients in this protocol may&#xD;
      receive future interleukin-2 treatment cycles at home. Home administration of IL-2 injections&#xD;
      involves less frequent data and safety monitoring and no medical evaluations at the Clinical&#xD;
      Center except at the beginning of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for home administration of IL-2, patients must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be enrolled in a current NIAID protocol for IL-2 therapy and have received at least 1&#xD;
           year of treatment on the protocol, with at least two well-tolerated outpatient cycles at&#xD;
           a stable dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a history of tolerable side effects while receiving IL-2 without frequent medical&#xD;
           interventions, intravenous fluid replacement or dose reductions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not have had any significant clinical or laboratory abnormalities during days 0 to 5 of&#xD;
           the last two outpatient cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a strong relationship with a private physician or health-care provider who has been&#xD;
           involved in the patient's care and is willing to help supervise the patient's care&#xD;
           during each home IL-2 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Live in a home with easy telephone access and have proved reliable in responding to&#xD;
           telephone calls from clinic staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give the clinic staff contact information for a close friend or relative who will agree&#xD;
           to serve as a caregiver during each home cycle, providing the patient non-medical&#xD;
           assistance and checking on his or her condition daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have reasonable access to emergency medical services and a nearby medical facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have proved reliable and consistent in using sterile technique, reconstituting IL-2&#xD;
           vials and administering subcutaneous IL-2 injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be receiving outpatient IL-2 injections cycles at least once every 6 months as part of&#xD;
           their normal protocol participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have access to a home weight scale and be able to weigh themselves each day for safety&#xD;
           monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive IL-2 cycles on the same schedule they followed in their original&#xD;
      protocol participation. They will be seen at the Clinical Center at regularly scheduled&#xD;
      follow-up visits between cycles and for a medical evaluation and blood drawing before the&#xD;
      start of each cycle to determine the safety of administering the cycle. During the home&#xD;
      cycle, the patient's case manager or other team member will place monitoring telephone calls&#xD;
      on days 2 and 4 of the cycle and again a week later. The timing and number of these calls may&#xD;
      change depending on the findings of ongoing assessments of their usefulness. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to notify the study team promptly of any complications or other problems that&#xD;
      develop with therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the initial phase of this study, HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts between 200 and 500&#xD;
      were randomized to receive either IL-2 alone by continuous IV infusion for 5 days every 8&#xD;
      weeks, IL-2 plus anti-TNF antibody, or IL-2 plus thalidomide. The primary endpoints of this&#xD;
      study are safety and tolerability of the IL-2/TNF inhibitor combination. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will include changes in CD4 counts, frequency and severity of IL-2 related side effects,&#xD;
      changes in serum TNF levels, and plasma viral load changes. The study period is one year,&#xD;
      with an optional extension period to follow. Enrollment was for up to forty-five IL-2-naive&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the amended phase of this study, up to 60 patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts equal&#xD;
      to or greater than 350 will be studied to determine the ability of prednisone to ameliorate&#xD;
      IL-2 related toxicity. Patients will be randomized to one of four groups: IL-2 alone; IL-2&#xD;
      plus prednisone; prednisone alone; no treatment. All four groups will be treated with a&#xD;
      combination regimen of antiretrovirals to include at least one protease inhibitor. IL-2 will&#xD;
      be dosed SQ at a starting dosage of 7.5 mlU bid x 5 days every 8 weeks, and prednisone (or&#xD;
      placebo) will be dosed at 0.5 mg/kg/day during IL-2 cycles. Primary endpoints are frequency&#xD;
      of IL-2 associated fatigue and fever, CD4 count changes, and viral load changes. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include frequency of other IL-2 side effects, concomitant medication use, steroid&#xD;
      associated side effects, cytokine changes during IL-2, and IL-2 total exposure in the IL-2&#xD;
      plus steroid vs. IL-2 plus placebo arms. The study period is one year with an optional&#xD;
      extension period to follow.&#xD;
