  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo controlled study evaluating the role of fludarabine (a nucleoside analog&#xD;
      targeting both resting and proliferating lymphocytes) in the treatment of moderate to severe&#xD;
      psoriotic arthritis. Patients should have failed at least one disease modifying antirheumatic&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and toxicity of immunosuppressive therapy using the adenine analogue fludarabine&#xD;
      will be evaluated in 20 patients with psoriatic arthritis, who have failed or have developed&#xD;
      intolerable side-effects to at least one disease modifying antirheumatic drug including&#xD;
      sulfasalazine, gold, methoxypsoralen and long wave ultraviolet A light (PUVA), retinoids,&#xD;
      methotrexate or cyclosporin. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial patients will&#xD;
      receive a four month course of intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day for 2-3 days every 4&#xD;
      weeks for a total of four cycles) or placebo by a block randomization procedure to ensure&#xD;
      groups balanced for disease activity. After a washout period of two months, the patients&#xD;
      receiving placebo will have the option of crossing over to the fludarabine arm for an&#xD;
      additional four months of treatment. Disease activity (both skin and joints) will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study. At the end of the study, physician and patient assessment of&#xD;
      disease activity as well as drug-related toxicities will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Ability to provide informed consent to all aspects of the study after full information is&#xD;
        provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age equal to or older than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Psoriatic arthritis of more than 6 months duration defined by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A psoriatic skin lesion (or history of psoriatic skin lesion documented by a physician)&#xD;
        with or without nail involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Peripheral arthritis alone or in combination with sacroiliitis. Patients with chest&#xD;
        expansion less than 2.5 cm or decreased flexion of the cervical and lumbosacral spine&#xD;
        flexion by 50% or more will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A negative serum test for rheumatoid factor and absence of subcutaneous nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiographic findings (if present) compatible with psoriatic arthritis (&quot;pencil in cup&#xD;
        lesion,&quot; osteolysis of the terminal phalanx, asymmetrical sacroiliitis, erosive&#xD;
        oligoarticular arthritis or spinal syndesmophytes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria a-c are required for diagnosis whereas criterion d is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active arthritis with 3 or more painful or swollen joints considered capable of responding&#xD;
        to drug therapy and at least 2 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tenderness or pain on movement of at least 3 joints (or periarticular areas).&#xD;
&#xD;
        30 minutes of morning stiffness (in peripheral joints or in the spine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than or equal to 28mm/hour or C-reactive&#xD;
        protein (CRP) greater than 0.8 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Failure to respond or development of intolerable side effects to at least one of the&#xD;
        following treatments: sulfasalazine, gold retinoids, PUVA, methotrexate, azathioprine or&#xD;
        cyclosporin. A waiting period of equal to or greater than 4 weeks after the end of previous&#xD;
        systemic treatment will be required before initiation of fludarabine treatment. Topical&#xD;
        treatment for psoriasis (glucocorticoids, tar, anthralin, etc.) should be discontinued 2&#xD;
        weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        not have seropositive, symmetric polyarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have the spondylitic form of psoriatic arthritis (spondylitis alone or in&#xD;
        combination with shoulder and hip arthritis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have arthritis mutilans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not be receiving glucocorticoids in doses greater than 10mg/day of prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have acute or chronic infections requiring antimicrobial therapy or&#xD;
        serious viral (e.g., hepatitis, herpes zoster or HIV infections) or fungal infections.&#xD;
        Patients with a positive PPD who have not received INH or other antituberculous therapy may&#xD;
        be excluded if in the opinion of an infectious disease consultant immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
        is contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females must not be pregnant or lactating. Females of childbearing age must be practicing&#xD;
        birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pre-existing malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma. All females must have a&#xD;
        negative Papanicolaou smear within a 3 month period prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of cerebrovascular accidents, seizure disorder or chronic neurologic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of documented coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy or dysrhythmia requiring&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No confounding medical illness that in the judgment of the investigators would pose added&#xD;
        risk for study participants (e.g., chronic hepatic, renal or pulmonary disease (PFTs less&#xD;
        than 70% of predicted value or DLCO less than 60%) or bone marrow hypoplasia (Hb less than&#xD;
        10 mg/dl, platelets less than 100.000/dl or WBC less than 3.400/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients who have received alkylating agents for greater than or equal to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 50 ml/min.&#xD;
