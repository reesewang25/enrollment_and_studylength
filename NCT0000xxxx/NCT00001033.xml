      PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT: To compare the combined rate of failure during therapy and relapse&#xD;
      after therapy between two durations of intermittent therapy (6 versus 9 months) for the&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected patients. To compare toxicity,&#xD;
      survival, and development of resistance in these two regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIGINAL: To compare the efficacy and safety of induction and continuation therapies for the&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients who are either from areas with known high&#xD;
      rates of resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs or from areas where TB is expected to be&#xD;
      susceptible to commonly used anti-TB drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT: In HIV-negative patients, intermittent anti-TB therapy has been shown&#xD;
      to be as effective as daily therapy, but the optimal duration of therapy in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIGINAL: In some areas of the country, resistance to one or more of the drugs commonly used&#xD;
      to treat TB has emerged. Thus, the need to test regimens containing a new drug exists.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the optimal duration of anti-TB therapy for HIV-infected patients with TB needs&#xD;
      to be determined.&#xD;

      patients has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIGINAL: In some areas of the country, resistance to one or more of the drugs commonly used&#xD;
      to treat TB has emerged. Thus, the need to test regimens containing a new drug exists.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the optimal duration of anti-TB therapy for HIV-infected patients with TB needs&#xD;
      to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT: Patients who have received an acceptable induction regimen prior to&#xD;
      study entry and have been found to be susceptible to isoniazid and rifampin with no&#xD;
      pyrazinamide resistance are randomized to receive either isoniazid or rifampin plus vitamin&#xD;
      B6 biweekly for 18 or 31 weeks. Patients are evaluated at months 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, and&#xD;
      every 4 months thereafter. Minimum follow-up is 1.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIGINAL: In the induction phase, patients enrolled in &quot;drug-susceptible&quot; areas (defined as&#xD;
      metropolitan areas with a resistance rate for isoniazid therapy of less than 10 percent)&#xD;
      receive four drugs: isoniazid (plus pyridoxine), rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in &quot;drug-resistant&quot; areas (resistance rate for isoniazid of 10 percent or&#xD;
      higher) receive the four-drug regimen with or without a fifth drug, levofloxacin. After 8&#xD;
      weeks of induction, patients with multi-drug resistance are removed from study regimens; all&#xD;
      other patients enter a continuation phase. Pansusceptible patients (showing susceptibility to&#xD;
      all first-line anti-TB drugs) receive two study drugs for an additional 18 or 31 weeks;&#xD;
      patients with isoniazid-resistant (or intolerant) TB receive two or three study drugs for an&#xD;
      additional 44 weeks, while those with rifampin-resistant TB receive two or three study drugs&#xD;
      for an additional 70 weeks. Patients are evaluated every 2 weeks in the induction phase and&#xD;
      every 12 weeks in the continuation phase. Minimum follow-up is 2 years.&#xD;
