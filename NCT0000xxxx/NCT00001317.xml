  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent double-blinded, placebo-controlled multi-center international study, subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections of interferon-gamma administered three times weekly reduced the frequency of&#xD;
      serious infections in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Patients receiving&#xD;
      interferon-gamma had fewer hospital stays, shorter in length, than the placebo group.&#xD;
      Children less than 10 years of age benefitted most from treatment and had fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, the FDA licensed interferon-gamma for prophylaxis in CGD patients. We&#xD;
      wish to monitor our patients who participated in the original study for possible long-term&#xD;
      side effects. Any new patients referred to us who are either on interferon-gamma or&#xD;
      considered to be candidates for interferon-gamma will be considered for this protocol. In&#xD;
      addition, our patients who were originally accepted under Genentech's compassionate plea&#xD;
      protocol will also be monitored under this new protocol. The patients will be evaluated every&#xD;
      six months, with blood work and interim medical histories taken.&#xD;

        The diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease as indicated by an unusual pattern of&#xD;
        infection in the patient or one pedigree relation, confirmed by both of the following&#xD;
        tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Abnormal neutrophil NBT slide test (following PMA stimulation) and neutrophil superoxide&#xD;
        anion production less than or equal to 20 percent normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preserved renal function (creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/100 mL; less than or&#xD;
        equal to 2+ proteinuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preserved hepatic function (bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/100 mL; prothrombin time&#xD;
        less than or equal to 1.3 x control).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preserved hematologic function (WBC greater than or equal to 3000/mm3; granulocytes greater&#xD;
        than 1500/mm3; platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        A minimum life expectancy of three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients seropositive for Hepatitis B surface antigen may be entered but serum specimens&#xD;
        for rIFN-y antibody should not be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of childbearing potential may be entered if using effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Full recovery from previous serious infections requiring hospitalization and parenteral&#xD;
        antibiotic therapy. At least two weeks must elapse following the cessation of parenteral&#xD;
        antibiotic therapy before study admission.&#xD;
