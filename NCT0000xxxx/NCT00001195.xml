  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers would like to determine normal ranges for hormone levels and to learn more about&#xD;
      the genetics involved in hormone production and action. Researchers will take samples of&#xD;
      blood, urine, saliva, and stool from healthy children ages 5-17 in order to study different&#xD;
      aspects of hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing a range of normal hormone levels in children will make diagnosing illnesses with&#xD;
      abnormal levels of hormones much easier. Hormone levels in the body can change throughout the&#xD;
      day. By collecting samples at different times researchers hope to learn more about the normal&#xD;
      daytime and nighttime patterns of hormone secretion. Because some hormone levels change with&#xD;
      body size, researchers will also take measurements of patient's body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve children and observe them as inpatients or as outpatients. &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We wish to obtain blood, urine, saliva, and stool specimens from healthy children ages 2-18&#xD;
      years for use in establishing the normal ranges of levels of hormones and the variations in&#xD;
      genes that are important for hormones to act. Such hormone values are extremely important to&#xD;
      allow endocrinologists to determine when hormone levels are truly abnormal in children&#xD;
      suspected of an illness. Because the values of some hormones change with body size, we will&#xD;
      obtain measurements of body composition when studying such hormones. Children participating&#xD;
      in this study may be studied in the outpatient clinic (at most 2 blood draws) or as&#xD;
      inpatients on the pediatric ward (for frequent blood sampling using an intravenous line over&#xD;
      a 24-hour period). Other studies that may be performed as part of this study include&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations of the thyroid, adrenal, ovaries or testes, and x-ray of the hand and&#xD;
      wrist for bone age determination.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 2 to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will be excluded for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing's&#xD;
        syndrome) or pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring continuous medication);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who have, or whose parent or guardians have, current substance abuse or a&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder or other condition which, in the opinion of the investigators, would&#xD;
        impede the ability to give informed consent or possibly hinder completion of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who regularly use prescription medications are not eligible. The use of&#xD;
        over-the-counter medications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        For those sub-studies involving MRI, inability to undergo MRI (e.g., volunteers with metal&#xD;
        within their bodies including cardiac pacemakers, neural pacemakers, aneurysmal clips,&#xD;
        shrapnel, ocular foreign bodies, cochlear implants, non-detachable electronic or&#xD;
        electromechanical devices such as infusion pumps, nerve stimulators, bone growth&#xD;
        stimulators, etc. that are contraindications).&#xD;
