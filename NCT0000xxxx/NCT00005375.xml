      To conduct a prospective study of the determinants of smoking onset in adolescents attending&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many smoking prevention programs have been implemented on a large-scale basis, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these programs varies greatly. While these programs have undoubtedly&#xD;
      prevented many young adults from starting to smoke, recent smoking initiation rates among&#xD;
      females have consistently exceeded the rates of males and smoking initiation rates among&#xD;
      Afro-Americans remain at high levels. More information is needed on the reasons for smoking&#xD;
      initiation among adolescents, particularly females. Despite considerable interest in this&#xD;
      area, virtually nothing is known regarding the reasons for adoption of smoking in Black or&#xD;
      white females. Not a single prospective study has evaluated race-and gender-specific models&#xD;
      for the prediction of smoking onset. For example, while it is commonly assumed that the&#xD;
      weight-reducing qualities of smoking are associated with smoking onset among female&#xD;
      adolescents, not a single prospective study has been conducted that documents that&#xD;
      weight-related concerns at one age predict smoking onset at a later age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of the Collaborative Projects on Women's Health initiative which was&#xD;
      proposed by the NHLBI staff, given concept clearance at the February 1992 National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Advisory Council, and released as a Request for Applications in April 1992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of a two grant project on the Collaborative Projects on Women's Health.&#xD;
      Dr. Robert Klesges conducted a longitudinal study to assess whether weight concerns of&#xD;
      adolescent girls predict smoking onset at a later age. His collaborator, Dr, Linda Eck&#xD;
      (R01HL50946), evaluated the role of smoking in dietary intake, physical activity, and&#xD;
      metabolic rate and determined the differential effects of smoking and race on the energy&#xD;
      balance of African American and white women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Klesges' study was renewed in FY 1998 to continue longitudinal observation of factors&#xD;
      relating to the onset of smoking in a biracial population of 6,967 boy and girl students&#xD;
      first surveyed as seventh graders in 1993-94. The cohort was tracked through the end of high&#xD;
      school and two years after high school in order to investigate the determinants of smoking&#xD;
      onset both in high school and into the young adult years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in February 2001 through January 2005 to follow-up participants for&#xD;
      four years post-high school to assess the extent of young adult smoking onset and cessation,&#xD;
      to determine predictors of smoking onset, and identify predictors of cessation for both early&#xD;
      onset and late onset smokers.&#xD;
