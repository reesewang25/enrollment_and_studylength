  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate activity in areas of&#xD;
      the brain. The PET technique allows researchers to study the normal processes in the brain&#xD;
      (central nervous system) of normal individuals and patients with neurologic illnesses without&#xD;
      physical / structural damage to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar&#xD;
      (glucose). As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and&#xD;
      water. Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain. As brain&#xD;
      activity increases, blood flow to and from the area of activity also increases. This is known&#xD;
      as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Knowing these facts, researchers can use radioactive&#xD;
      water (H215O) and PET scans to observe what areas of the brain are receiving more blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers plan to investigate the changes in regional cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      (rCBF) as patients participate in different activities. The activities are designed to&#xD;
      stimulate the areas of the brain responsible for voluntary motor activity and sensation. By&#xD;
      comparing the results of PET scans performed in different conditions, researchers can locate&#xD;
      regions of the brain responsible for specific tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should provide new information about voluntary movements in humans and the&#xD;
      preparation involved in controlling them.&#xD;

      The main purpose of the studies presented in this protocol is to investigate the physiology&#xD;
      of motor control in health as well as the pathophysiological modifications taking place&#xD;
      during disease. To this end, we will investigate changes in regional cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      (rCBF) as an index of regional neuronal activity, associated with various motor and sensory&#xD;
      tasks using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The rCBF will be obtained by measuring the&#xD;
      distribution of the cerebral radioactivity during emission scans following the intravenous&#xD;
      bolus injection of 15O-labeled water. The very short half-life of 15O (2 minutes) allows us&#xD;
      to measure rCBF repeatedly under different task conditions (see methodology and experimental&#xD;
      procedures). With the comparison between PET scans performed in different conditions, we can&#xD;
      detect the specific task-related activated regions. PET images will be coregistered to high&#xD;
      resolution Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) to get more accurate anatomical information&#xD;
      regarding the activated areas. The results will be correlated with that from other&#xD;
      physiological approaches including Electroencephalography (EEG), Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (TMS), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (MRS). These studies should provide new information not only about the executive&#xD;
      component of the voluntary movements in humans but also the different organizational aspects&#xD;
      of the preparatory processes that control them.&#xD;
