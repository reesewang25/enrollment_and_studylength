      To define the role of nutritional and dietary variables in determining atherogenic traits and&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality due to coronary heart disease as observed in the Framingham Heart&#xD;
      Study cohort and the Framingham Offspring Study cohort.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major component of the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease is the&#xD;
      attenuation of its major underlying process, atherosclerosis, which brings about myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia. In exploring the determinants of atherosclerosis, a diet-heart hypothesis has&#xD;
      emerged. Simply stated, the hypothesis is that the excessive ingestion of dietary fat,&#xD;
      notably total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol and lowered intakes of other nutrients&#xD;
      including unsaturated fatty acids and possibly soluble fiber lead to the elevation of serum&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol which causes atherosclerosis. Support of the diet-heart hypothesis is&#xD;
      available from epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of a broad range of data supporting the diet-heart hypothesis, the importance of&#xD;
      diet is often challenged. Cited in this controversy are population-based, cross-sectional&#xD;
      studies which have provided conflicting data. Several studies including an early report from&#xD;
      Framingham and the Tecumseh Study have failed on cross-sectional analysis to link dietary&#xD;
      variables to serum cholesterol, lipoproteins or coronary heart disease rates. The genetic and&#xD;
      possible dietary homogeneity in these populations and methodological weaknesses inherent in&#xD;
      singe serum cholesterol and dietary assessments have been posed as possible explanations for&#xD;
      these differing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties in confirming the diet-heart hypothesis across existing literature may arise for&#xD;
      several reasons: methodological problems inherent in estimating nutrient intake; difficulties&#xD;
      associated with characterizing a behavior as complex as food purchasing; wide intraindividual&#xD;
      variation in nutrient intake that make single day estimates of nutrient intake difficult to&#xD;
      interpret; dissimilarities among dietary data collection techniques; varying lengths of&#xD;
      followup for the observation of outcome variables in longitudinal epidemiologic studies;&#xD;
      differing methods of lipid measurement or the lack of lipoprotein subfractionation. The&#xD;
      Framingham data provide a unique opportunity to test the diet-heart hypothesis both&#xD;
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally, to develop models for studying diet and heart disease&#xD;
      relationships, and to establish the importance of dietary variables in atherogenesis and the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associations between nutritional variables and major atherogenic risk factors including&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, impaired glucose tolerance, and overweight were&#xD;
      investigated cross-sectionally in the total Framingham Offspring Study cohort of 3,800. The&#xD;
      independent, quantitative effects of dietary factors on the prediction of cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality were explored longitudinally in two samples of the original&#xD;
      Framingham cohort at 20 and 30 years of follow-up. Six major steps were followed in each set&#xD;
      of analyses: dimension reduction using cluster and factor analysis; zero order independent&#xD;
      nutrition variable analyses; stepwise multiple regression of independent variables;&#xD;
      specification of overall regression models; stability and validity testing; the addition of&#xD;
      intervening variables using multiple regression techniques. Multivariate analyses of the&#xD;
      dependent variables were conducted to determine associations and interactions among these&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
