  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaposi s sarcoma (KS) is caused by a gammaherpesvirus called Kaposi s sarcoma-associated&#xD;
      herpesvirus (KSHV), or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). However, infection with KSHV is not&#xD;
      sufficient to cause KS, and HIV infection is an important cofactor. Treatment of HIV with&#xD;
      potent antiretroviral therapy can reduce the risk of KS, and can also induce regression in&#xD;
      patients with established HIV-KS. One mechanism by which HIV is believed to contribute to KS&#xD;
      is through HIV-induced immunodeficiency which leads to a loss of immunologic control of KSHV&#xD;
      and/or KS itself. However, other mechanisms may also contribute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One primary objective is to assess the effects of the initiation of potent anti-HIV therapy&#xD;
      on specific factors possibly linked to the control or pathogenesis of KS, namely serum viral&#xD;
      IL-6 and plasma VEGF levels, in patients with KS or at risk for KS by virtue of being&#xD;
      infected with KSHV/HHV-8. Another is to assess the effects of anti-HIV therapy on KSHV&#xD;
      infection. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of potent antiretroviral therapy on&#xD;
      established KS and other factors related to KS or KSHV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal eligibility factors are age 13 or above, HIV infection, and either KS or&#xD;
      infection with KSHV. Exclusion factors include KS that requires specific therapy, recent&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy, recent cytokine therapy, or opportunistic infections requiring&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with potent antiretroviral therapy. For patients with established&#xD;
      KS, the effects of the therapy on the KS will be monitored. In addition, a variety of factors&#xD;
      related to KS, HIV infection, therapy, or KSHV infection will be monitored. These include the&#xD;
      HIV viral load, KSHV secretion in saliva, the CD4 count, serum VEGF levels, and serum IL-6&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
