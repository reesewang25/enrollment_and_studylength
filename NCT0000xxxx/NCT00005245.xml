      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic structure refers to aspects of communities -- their industries, physical&#xD;
      resources, occupational and income distributions -- that create the conditions for change in&#xD;
      health-related exposures, behaviors, and availability of quality medical care. Preliminary&#xD;
      studies suggest growing inequalities in ischemic heart disease mortality in communities at&#xD;
      different levels of socioeconomic structure that probably reflect both differences in timing&#xD;
      of onset of decline and rate of decline of mortality. Despite the beginning of a national&#xD;
      decline of ischemic heart disease mortality for white men in the middle 1960's, some&#xD;
      communities only began the decline some years later, at which time the national decline&#xD;
      accelerated. Late declining communities were more likely to be nonmetropolitan and in the&#xD;
      South. Further analyses showed that the onset of decline was strongly related to measures of&#xD;
      socioeconomic structure, and that income-related characteristics could account for much of&#xD;
      the previously observed metropolitan differential. Another study showed that the decline of&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease in both white men and women has been greater in county groups with&#xD;
      occupational structures characterized by higher levels of white collar employment. The trend&#xD;
      toward greater relative geographic inequality of mortality appears to be stronger for&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease than for stroke, all cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality.&#xD;
      Prevention strategies should take account of these processes not only to achieve a more&#xD;
      equitable distribution of health but to target populations with the greatest excess risk&#xD;
      available for reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several analyses were conducted using mortality data from the National Center for Health&#xD;
      Statistics and population and socioeconomic data from the Census Bureau. The onset of decline&#xD;
      of ischemic heart disease in white women and Black men was analyzed in relation to geographic&#xD;
      region, metropolitan status, and socioeconomic structure. The association between onset of&#xD;
      decline of ischemic heart disease and its rate of decline was studied. The relationship of&#xD;
      occupational structure and other aspects of socioeconomic structure to the rate of decline of&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease mortality in Blacks and whites was quantified by age. Geographic&#xD;
      variations in levels and trends of stroke mortality were described in relation to&#xD;
      socioeconomic structure. The associations of socioeconomic structure, cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk factors, blood pressure treatment, and mortality were quantified in geographic areas&#xD;
      sampled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Socioeconomic&#xD;
      structure-mortality trend associations for ischemic heart disease and stroke were compared to&#xD;
      associations for all cardiovascular disease, all-cause and non-specific causes. A detailed&#xD;
      analysis was made of socioeconomic structure-mortality associations in the United States&#xD;
      South with special attention to impact on Black/white mortality differentials.&#xD;
