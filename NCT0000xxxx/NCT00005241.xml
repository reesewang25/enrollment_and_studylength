    <textblock>
      To assess whether current oral contraceptive (OC) use (within the previous month) increased&#xD;
      the risk of myocardial infarction. Also, to assess the combined effects of cigarette smoking&#xD;
      and oral contraceptive use.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been established that oral contraceptive formulations used in the 1960s and 1970s&#xD;
      increased the risks of myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, and stroke. Oral&#xD;
      contraceptive formulations have changed, as have prescribing practices, and there was a need&#xD;
      for information on the effects of the newer formulations in use. Myocardial infarction is the&#xD;
      most important cardiovascular disease in terms of the incidence and mortality attributed to&#xD;
      use of oral contraceptives; although the overall incidence of myocardial infarction is&#xD;
      relatively low in women of childbearing ages, the incidence is not low in smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case-control design was used. The case series consisted of women 18 to 44 years of age&#xD;
      admitted for a documented first myocardial infarction to any of 100 collaborating hospitals&#xD;
      in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania. Nurse interviewers administered standard&#xD;
      structured questionnaires to cases and controls on drug use, race, religion, medical history&#xD;
      and myocardial infarction risk factors. Information was collected on: cigarette smoking;&#xD;
      histories of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, angina, abnormal plasma lipids; reproductive&#xD;
      and menstrual histories; alcohol and coffee consumption; personality type using the&#xD;
      Framingham Type A scale; family history of myocardial infarction; exercise; education and&#xD;
      occupation of the patient and her spouse. Information was also obtained on the timing and&#xD;
      duration of oral contraceptive use. The effect of oral contraceptive use was considered among&#xD;
      nonsmokers, light smokers, and heavy smokers. Individual oral contraceptive formulations were&#xD;
      classified according to dosage and type of estrogen, formulation type, and other groupings.&#xD;
      Multiple logistic regression analysis with fitting of the regression equations by the method&#xD;
      of maximum likelihood was used for simultaneous control of all potential confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed in 1995 to continue data collection to establish the effect of&#xD;
      triphasic OCs on MI risk, with particular attention to the joint effect with heavy smoking.&#xD;
      The new data collection also permitted more definitive analysis of the effect of monophasic&#xD;
      OCs. Triphasic formulations have become popular and in 1995 accounted for about half of OC&#xD;
      use. There were not enough users of triphasic OCs in the present study for informative&#xD;
      analysis, nor were there any data from other studies on this issue. The study ended in&#xD;
      December, 1999.&#xD;
