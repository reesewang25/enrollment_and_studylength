      To determine the best, clinically useful procedure to prevent or minimize platelet&#xD;
      alloimmunization as a cause of refractoriness to platelet transfusion in patients undergoing&#xD;
      marrow ablative chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 1971 and 1980, there was a 598 percent increase in the use of platelet concentrates&#xD;
      from 0.41 million to more than 2.86 million annually. In contrast, red cell transfusions in&#xD;
      the United States rose concurrently from 6.3 million annually to 9.9 million, an increase of&#xD;
      58 percent. Although red cell transfusions have leveled or even decreased slightly in the&#xD;
      past several years, the use of platelets has continued to increase at a rate of at least 5 to&#xD;
      10 percent each year. This dramatic and continued increase in the use of platelet&#xD;
      concentrates is largely the result of treating thrombocytopenic cancer patients. In addition,&#xD;
      open heart surgery patients and others given massive transfusions also receive substantial&#xD;
      platelet support. Nevertheless, it is the chronically transfused thrombocytopenic patient who&#xD;
      frequently develops platelet alloimmunization and accounts for a large percentage of the&#xD;
      increased demand for platelets. A recent survey in a large transfusion service indicated that&#xD;
      8 percent of the patients had received 35 percent of the random-donor pooled platelet&#xD;
      concentrates. Although some alloimmunized patients can be supported by HLA-matched,&#xD;
      apheresis-donor platelets, suitably matched donors are not available in sufficient numbers&#xD;
      for every patient. Thus, platelet transfusion programs that could prevent, or at least delay&#xD;
      platelet alloimmunization would be of substantial benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited studies have suggested several approaches that may reduce or prevent platelet&#xD;
      alloimmunization: reducing the number of foreign antigens to which a recipient is exposed by&#xD;
      providing single donor platelet apheresis products; providing leukocyte-poor blood products;&#xD;
      inactivating donor antigen presenting cells (APC's), a type of lymphocyte contained within&#xD;
      the transfused platelet products, by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of platelet concentrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiative was recommended by the Blood Diseases and Resources Advisory Committee in May&#xD;
      1987 and approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in September 1987.&#xD;
      The Requests for Applications were released in June 1988.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind. There were three treatment arms and one control arm. Patients in&#xD;
      the treatment arms received either leukocyte-poor filtered pooled random donor platelets, or&#xD;
      ultraviolet irradiated pooled random donor platelets, or leukocyte-poor filtered single donor&#xD;
      apheresis platelets. Patients in the control group received routinely pooled, random-donor&#xD;
      platelets. Patients remained on their assigned treatments for all transfusions through eight&#xD;
      weeks. Assigned transfusions were discontinued only in the event of severe adverse reaction&#xD;
      to the platelet transfusions, granulocyte transfusions, bone marrow transplant, withdrawal of&#xD;
      informed consent, or death. Pre- and post transfusion counts were obtained for all platelet&#xD;
      transfusions. Each patient was followed for one year. Recruitment continued through March&#xD;
      1995. Data analysis ended in July 1997.&#xD;
