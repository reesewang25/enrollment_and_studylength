  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if alternating zidovudine (AZT) and zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) (first&#xD;
      one and then the other) or intermittent therapy (1 week of drug then 1 week off) will lessen&#xD;
      the toxic effects of either drug alone, while still inhibiting HIV (the AIDS virus) in&#xD;
      patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZT extends the survival of some patients with AIDS, and both AZT and ddC are known to&#xD;
      inhibit the growth of HIV. When AZT or ddC is given continuously over a prolonged period of&#xD;
      time, toxic effects occur that are not found when the drugs are given for 4 - 6 weeks. It is&#xD;
      hoped that by alternating the drugs or by giving one drug intermittently, the toxic effects&#xD;
      can be decreased without lowering the therapeutic effectiveness of the drugs.&#xD;

      AZT extends the survival of some patients with AIDS, and both AZT and ddC are known to&#xD;
      inhibit the growth of HIV. When AZT or ddC is given continuously over a prolonged period of&#xD;
      time, toxic effects occur that are not found when the drugs are given for 4 - 6 weeks. It is&#xD;
      hoped that by alternating the drugs or by giving one drug intermittently, the toxic effects&#xD;
      can be decreased without lowering the therapeutic effectiveness of the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to 1 of 7 treatment groups. Both AZT and ddC will be given by mouth&#xD;
      every 4 hours. One group will take AZT continuously for 52 weeks. One group will alternate 1&#xD;
      week of AZT with a week with no drug for 48 weeks and another group will alternate 1 week of&#xD;
      ddC with a week of no drug for 48 weeks. Other groups will alternate AZT and either low-dose&#xD;
      or high-dose ddC on a weekly basis or a monthly basis for 48 weeks. Patients will be seen&#xD;
      weekly for the first 8 weeks of study and less often thereafter. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      withdrawn frequently and evaluated for possible changes in the immune system, toxic effects,&#xD;
      and possible changes in the amount of HIV in the blood. Lumbar punctures and skin biopsies&#xD;
      will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENDED: All patients receiving continuous AZT will be switched to a lower dose of AZT if&#xD;
      they have not already been switched. This is in accordance with results of NIAID ACTG 002,&#xD;
      016, and 019 which demonstrate that this dose of AZT delays progression of HIV symptoms.&#xD;
