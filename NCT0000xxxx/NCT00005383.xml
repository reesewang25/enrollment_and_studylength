  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine anger and cardiovascular disease risk in urban youth. The project studied patterns&#xD;
      of hemodynamic responses to social and nonsocial stressors, ambulatory blood pressure (BP),&#xD;
      fasting insulin, fasting glucose, lipid profiles, and central obesity in adolescents from a&#xD;
      wide range of socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urban adolescents at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) exhibit a pattern of&#xD;
      hemodynamic responses that: (a) is evoked by social encounters that arouse anger,&#xD;
      defensiveness, and distrust; (b) appears related to increased insulin resistance; (c) is more&#xD;
      pronounced in males and African Americans; and (d) may constitute a pathway via which chronic&#xD;
      exposure to stressful social environments increases CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were four studies. Study 1 in the first two years measured hemodynamics in 200 subjects&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that hostile distrust was associated with increased total peripheral&#xD;
      resistance (TPR) response to social challenge, and that adolescents exhibiting this response&#xD;
      pattern had elevated levels of ambulatory BP, fasting insulin, glucose, blood lipids, and&#xD;
      central obesity. Study 2 followed 200 subjects for four years to determine if defensive&#xD;
      hostility and distrust were related to tracking at higher levels of BP (measured every 6&#xD;
      months), and insulin/ glucose/ cholesterol (measured once per year). Study 3 in years 3 and 4&#xD;
      evaluated the influence of race on the cross-situational consistency of hostile distrust/BP&#xD;
      by measuring the latter responses in 200 adolescents during structured encounters with a&#xD;
      friend of the same race and sex, an unfamiliar same-race peer, and an unfamiliar other-race&#xD;
      peer (black or white). Study 4 evaluated video and audiotape recordings from Studies 1 and 3&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that distrustful individuals expressed more hostile affect in&#xD;
      encounters with others, elicited more negative treatment, were perceived as hostile&#xD;
      regardless of observer race or gender, and thus experienced chronic, health-damaging&#xD;
      interpersonal stress. Study 4 data were used to examine the possibility that hostile distrust&#xD;
      is related to exposure to crime, poverty, and racial discrimination.&#xD;
