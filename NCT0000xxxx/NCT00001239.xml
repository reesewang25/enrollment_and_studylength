  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate a dose intensive chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of locally advanced and&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to&#xD;
      ameliorate chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Combination chemotherapy consists of Flurouricil,&#xD;
      Leucovorin, Adriamycin, and Cytoxan (FLAC) which will be given every 21 days for 10 cycles.&#xD;
      This protocol will replace the phase I study of this regimen (MB-232/88-C-0207) which found&#xD;
      the MTD of this regimen to be at the first dose level. This is a phase II study to determine&#xD;
      response rates of this regimen in advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

        All stage III or clinical T3N0 or TxN2 patients must have a histologically documented&#xD;
        diagnosis of breast carcinoma and evaluate disease in the breast or axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with stage III must enter this protocol within 12 weeks of the initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer must have histologically proven diagnosis&#xD;
        and must have evaluate disease. Patients with bone-only disease may be considered eligible&#xD;
        after discussion with Dr. Kenneth Cowan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Stage III disease, there must be no history of prior cytotoxic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stage IV patients will be eligible if they have had prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
        hormonal therapy provided the regimen did not included adriamycin. Patients will also be&#xD;
        eligible if they have been treated with one prior Phase I or II single chemotherapy agent&#xD;
        on a Medicine branch protocol. Patients who have had prior radiation therapy may be&#xD;
        eligible providing there was not extensive radiation to the cardiac area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There must be no history of previous malignancy except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
        (basal cell carcinoma) and cervical cancer in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance status (Karnofsky scale) must be greater than 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WBC count greater than 4000/mm3 and platelet count 100,000/mm3, unless there is evidence of&#xD;
        bone marrow involvement with tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Liver function tests (SGOT, Alk. Phosph., and T. Bilil) should be less than 1.5 times the&#xD;
        upper limits of normal, and serum creatinine should be less than 1.7 or creatinine&#xD;
        clearance should be greater than 45 ml/min unless these abnormalities are due to tumor&#xD;
        involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnant patients may be entered on this study; all patients should be informed about&#xD;
        the need for contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of other malignant neoplasms except for curatively treated basal cell skin&#xD;
        cancer or surgically cured carcinoma of the cervix in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not be in poor medical or psychiatric risks because of nonmalignant systemic&#xD;
        disease which would preclude them being subjected to any treatments in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of cardiac disease must have a normal ejection fraction by MUGA&#xD;
        Scan and have no angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have evidence of CNS metastasis.&#xD;
