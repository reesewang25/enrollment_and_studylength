      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several algorithms have been developed to calculate multivariate risk of CVD based on&#xD;
      characteristics associated with the disease. Framingham Heart Study data were used to develop&#xD;
      the original algorithms, along with later models, using different mathematical forms,&#xD;
      outcomes, and characteristics. Researchers then began to investigate the issue of&#xD;
      generalizability, whether these risk estimates could be applied to new populations. For these&#xD;
      algorithms to have general application, they must be able to rank risk correctly. And, when&#xD;
      Framingham models were compared to new models developed for other studies, resulting&#xD;
      orderings of risk were, in fact, similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to order risk correctly, however, does not imply that estimated probabilities are&#xD;
      right in terms of predicting disease for individuals. Methods are needed to assess individual&#xD;
      risk to make treatment decisions, do cost-benefit analyses, and quantify benefits. These&#xD;
      methods must be based on the patient's absolute risk, and existing equations may be incapable&#xD;
      of establishing absolute risk across populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier comparisons of multivariate risk among studies have made comparison populations as&#xD;
      homogenous as possible before analysis. However, if multivariate risk estimates are to be&#xD;
      truly useful, they must be applicable to the general population, and to be applicable,&#xD;
      estimates must be based on comparisons of cohorts that include women and ethnic minorities.&#xD;
      Also, in statistical terms, estimates must be robust enough to allow for minor shifts in&#xD;
      methodologies for data collection and endpoint definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The heterogeneity of multivariate risk in different populations was examined based on data&#xD;
      from studies representing national samples, cohort studies, and clinical trials. An analysis&#xD;
      of these studies was conducted that included both sexes, various risk profiles, and&#xD;
      representatives from several nationalities and ethnic groups. The pooled sample involved 20&#xD;
      studies, 233,833 participants, and over 47,000 deaths. Based on a common statistical&#xD;
      approach, proportional hazards models were developed for each study to relate a set of&#xD;
      essential characteristics to the prediction of CVD mortality. The characteristics included&#xD;
      body mass index, age, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, smoking, and diabetes status. The&#xD;
      models were then compared in terms of their ability to predict absolute risk of mortality&#xD;
      across studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses were conducted to discover factors associated with inaccurate prediction&#xD;
      and study characteristics associated with particular findings, such as interaction terms. An&#xD;
      empirical examination was conducted of methods for adding newly discovered risk factors to&#xD;
      existing prediction equations.&#xD;
