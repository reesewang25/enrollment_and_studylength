      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1986, the Department of the Navy initiated the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry.&#xD;
      Because the support of a National Bone Marrow Donor Registry was not very closely related to&#xD;
      the Navy's primary missions, in 1989 the management of the contract for the program was&#xD;
      transferred by the Congress from the Navy to the NHLBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By 1989, bone marrow transplantation had become an effective and accepted treatment for an&#xD;
      increasing number of diseases of the bone marrow and the immune system. Until only a few&#xD;
      years prior to 1989, most marrow donors were siblings, carefully matched for HLA (tissue)&#xD;
      antigens. Since only a small proportion of candidates for a bone marrow transplant have&#xD;
      matched brothers or sisters, additional family members were tried as donors. These included&#xD;
      parents, children, slightly mismatched siblings, and other relatives. Even with the&#xD;
      broadening of the bone marrow donor source, no more than 30-40 percent of patients with&#xD;
      diseases amenable to marrow transplant therapy had available donors. Improved results with&#xD;
      these selectively mismatched relatives and a distinct need to provide appropriate treatment&#xD;
      for more patients led to trials with unrelated, HLA-matched community volunteers as bone&#xD;
      marrow donors. By 1989, research had progressed to the point where transplants from such&#xD;
      unrelated donors were nearly as successful as those from matched siblings, when stratified by&#xD;
      disease status and risk parameters. In 1989, 20 to 25 percent of patients for whom a formal&#xD;
      donor search was initiated received a transplant. This was expected to increase&#xD;
      substantially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program was established by the Department of the Navy in 1986 and transferred to the&#xD;
      NHLBI in 1989. The purpose was to develop and maintain a registry of individuals willing to&#xD;
      donate bone marrow for patients in need of transplants, to facilitate marrow transplants by&#xD;
      serving as a coordinating and communications center for a network of donor, collection and&#xD;
      transplant centers in the United States and internationally, and to facilitate research into&#xD;
      the efficacy of unrelated donor marrow transplants. In 1992, the program was enlarged to&#xD;
      support a limited number of demonstration projects to develop, implement, and evaluate&#xD;
      innovative models for minority marrow donor recruitment. In 1995, the NMDP was transferred to&#xD;
      the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), although NHLBI provided funds in&#xD;
      this year.&#xD;
