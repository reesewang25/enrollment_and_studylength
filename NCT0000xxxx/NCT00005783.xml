  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that results from a single nucleotide substitution&#xD;
      in codon 6 of the beta-globin gene which, in the homozygous state, produces an abnormal&#xD;
      hemoglobin that is prone to polymer formation when deoxygenated. The polymerized hemoglobin&#xD;
      leads to impaired deformability and sickling of red blood cells which subsequently lodge in&#xD;
      end-arterioles producing the classic and most prominent feature of the disorder, repeated&#xD;
      vasoocclusive crises. Despite knowledge of the precise genetic defect for decades, only&#xD;
      recently has there been therapeutic impact based upon this knowledge when a clear benefit&#xD;
      from treatment with hydroxyurea, a cell cycle-specific agent administered to induce&#xD;
      production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) by stimulating gamma-globin synthesis, was reported in&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The reduction in the frequency and severity of&#xD;
      vasoocclusive crises seen has been attributed to the increase in HbF levels in responsive&#xD;
      patients. While the majority of patients demonstrate a rise in HbF, not all such patients&#xD;
      benefit from treatment. Given these results, alternative agents that also stimulate the&#xD;
      production of HbF warrant investigation in the treatment of SCD. Recombinant-methionyl human&#xD;
      stem cell factor (SCF) is a hematopoietic growth factor with activity on immature&#xD;
      hematopoietic progenitor cells. SCF stimulates the production of HbF in vitro and in vivo,&#xD;
      and this effect is attainable without the myelosuppression associated with hydroxyurea. In&#xD;
      this phase I/II trial, we will administer SCF in a dose escalating fashion to patients with&#xD;
      sickling disorders. Parameters to be measured are HbF levels, F cell levels, peripheral blood&#xD;
      CD34 levels, frequency, duration, and severity of vasoocclusive crises, and toxicity.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Hb SS, Sbeta-thal, SD, or SO-Arab&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must have had a previous neurologic event (either symptomatic or found by imaging&#xD;
        alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
