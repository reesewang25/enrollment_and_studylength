      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While PEF has routinely been applied in the diagnosis and management of asthma, scientists&#xD;
      were finding new applications for PEF as both a clinical and epidemiologic tool for following&#xD;
      individuals with pulmonary diseases, studying the natural history of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, and evaluating the impact of environmental exposures on lung function. Yet&#xD;
      the standardization of the PEF measurement lagged behind its application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The little attention paid to the performance characteristics of the PEF maneuver contrasted&#xD;
      sharply with the efforts to standardize measurement procedures for FEV1 and FVC. The American&#xD;
      Thoracic Society devoted a great deal of attention to studying these measures and published&#xD;
      guidelines for the standardization of their measurement. These guidelines included detailed&#xD;
      protocols for calibrating equipment, administering the tests, determining reproducibility,&#xD;
      and interpreting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research provided data on the optimal number of trials per test session, the difference&#xD;
      between a PEF performed during a full forced expiratory effort and that resulting from a&#xD;
      short blast, the impact of test supervision on test performance, and the reproducibility of&#xD;
      the PEF measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline survey of ventilatory function was performed using spirometry. PEF was measured&#xD;
      daily with a mini-Wright Peak Flow Meter over a period of several weeks in a study of 201&#xD;
      normals (staff, faculty and graduate students at the University of Massachusetts Lowell).&#xD;
      Serial PEF data were collected on a group of mild asthmatics identified in a local&#xD;
      occupational medicine clinic. Finally, performance characteristics were examined in serial&#xD;
      PEF data from two existing occupational cohort studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in&#xD;
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.&#xD;
