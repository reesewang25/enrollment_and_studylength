      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess and compare the incidence and severity of cardiorespiratory events&#xD;
      documented by home monitoring in infants at increased epidemiological risk for sudden infant&#xD;
      death syndrome (SIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the antecedent medical, demographic, physiologic, and behavioral&#xD;
      characteristics that predict the incidence of cardiorespiratory events documented by home&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter collaborative study. Patients are stratified into 4&#xD;
      groups: healthy term infants, apnea of infancy, subsequent siblings of SIDS victims, and&#xD;
      preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregivers are trained in the use of home monitor equipment and in the graded response to&#xD;
      monitor alarms (observation, gentle stimulation, more vigorous stimulation, mouth to mouth&#xD;
      breathing, and full cardiopulmonary resuscitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers undergo infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training (not required for&#xD;
      caregivers of healthy term infants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information is obtained on each infant. A 30 second recording of each infant's&#xD;
      cry is performed at study entry and at 1 month corrected age, and at the polysomnogram. A&#xD;
      urine sample is collected and frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHIME monitor is used during sleep and whenever the infant is not being observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overnight polysomnography is performed within 2 weeks of study entry. At 1, 2.5, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months corrected age, infants participate in a clinical evaluation. Neurodevelopmental status&#xD;
      is assessed at 1, 4, and 12 months corrected age.&#xD;
