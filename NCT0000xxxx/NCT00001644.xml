      This study will try to define how and where HIV infection persists in the body by&#xD;
      determining: 1) if there are cells where HIV can live for long periods of time without being&#xD;
      seen and destroyed by the immune system; 2) if there are sites where anti-HIV drugs cannot&#xD;
      penetrate enough to stop new HIV replication; and 3) if HIV in certain lymph nodes can remain&#xD;
      infectious for prolonged periods of time. It will also explore whether immune system damage&#xD;
      caused by HIV can be repaired after new virus replication is stopped with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study, which will&#xD;
      include three groups as follows. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, blood and urine tests and possibly chest X-ray and electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into three groups according to CD4 count levels: &gt; 500&#xD;
      cells/microliter of blood; between 300 and 500 cells/microliter, and &lt; 300 cells/microliter&#xD;
      of blood. All participants will be treated with a combination of four antiretroviral drugs:&#xD;
      indinavir, zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. (Exceptions to this regimen may be made in&#xD;
      certain circumstances for patients who cannot tolerate one of the four drugs.) In addition,&#xD;
      they will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests - Blood tests will be done at screening and at study entry to evaluate the&#xD;
      patient's health status and measure CD4 T cell count and plasma HIV levels; at the beginning&#xD;
      of treatment to look for drug-related side effects; and during the course of the study to&#xD;
      evaluate drug effectiveness in inhibiting HIV replication; CD4 T cell levels and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymph node biopsy - Lymph node biopsies are done under local anesthesia. A small incision is&#xD;
      made, the node is removed, and the incision is closed with stitches. Up to two nodes may be&#xD;
      removed during each procedure. Patients with CD4 counts greater than 500 cells/microliter of&#xD;
      blood and those with counts less than 300 cells/microliter will have three lymph node&#xD;
      biopsies in order to 1) assess the effectiveness of therapy in inhibiting HIV replication in&#xD;
      the nodes (the major site of replication); 2) determine how long HIV-infected cells may&#xD;
      persist in the nodes after new replication is stopped by therapy; and 3) determine if immune&#xD;
      damage caused by HIV can be repaired when virus replication is stopped. Lymph node biopsy in&#xD;
      patients with counts between 300 and 500 cells/microliter of blood is required only at&#xD;
      baseline, although follow-up biopsies are encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis - In this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm&#xD;
      vein. The blood circulates through a cell separator machine where the white cells are removed&#xD;
      and collected. The rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle&#xD;
      used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed in the other arm. The collected&#xD;
      white cells are used for special studies of the level and function of T cells before and&#xD;
      after drug treatment. Patients with CD4 counts &gt; 500 cells/microliter and &lt; 300&#xD;
      cells/microliter will undergo leukapheresis up to four times - at study entry and about 2, 6&#xD;
      and 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy. Patients with CD4 counts between 300 and&#xD;
      500 cells/microliter will have this procedure either at study entry and 6 and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      initiation therapy, or on the same schedule as the other patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The reservoirs of HIV-1 infection that permit maintenance of persistent virus infection (even&#xD;
      when virus replication cannot be detected using sensitive assays to quantify plasma HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      levels) are currently unknown. Potential sites for persistent HIV-1 infection include cells&#xD;
      with chronic or latent infections, cells present in locations within the body where antiviral&#xD;
      drugs may not penetrate in levels sufficient to prevent additional cycles of de novo virus&#xD;
      infection (e.g., the central nervous system), the presence of susceptible target cells for&#xD;
      virus infection that may not metabolize certain antiviral drugs to their active inhibitory&#xD;
      forms (e.g., macrophages), or extracellular (possible infectious) virus that may be retained&#xD;
      on the surface of follicular dendritic cells within lymphoid organs. In an attempt to&#xD;
      determine which, if any, of these potential reservoirs contribute to persistent HIV-1&#xD;
      infection, HIV-1-infected persons in two groups categorized by CD4+ T cell levels will be&#xD;
      treated with concomitant administration of 4 antiviral drugs (zidovudine, lamivudine,&#xD;
      indinavir and nevirapine) to accomplish maximal achievable suppression of virus replication.&#xD;
      The rates of decay of virus and virus-infected cells following initiation of antiviral (and&#xD;
      steroid) therapy will be monitored with sensitive, quantitative assays, and the identity and&#xD;
      longevity of persistent sites of infection will be determined. This study may also illuminate&#xD;
      to what extent HIV-1-induced immune system damage manifest as decreased CD4 T cell responses,&#xD;
      a constricted repertoire of T cell antigen recognition, or as structural compromise of&#xD;
      lymphoid tissue architecture can be reversed upon cessation of active HIV-1 replication by&#xD;
      combinations of potent antiviral drugs.&#xD;
