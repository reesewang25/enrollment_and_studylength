  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      St. John's Wort is a popular dietary supplement that many people take to elevate mood or&#xD;
      relieve stress. This study will test in normal volunteers whether this preparation may alter&#xD;
      mood and if so, by what means. Animal studies suggest that St. John's Wort may work similarly&#xD;
      to some antidepressants that affect levels of the chemical serotonin in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study must also be enrolled in NIMH protocol #98-M-0094 (SPECT Imaging&#xD;
      of Dopamine and Serotonin Transporters in Neuropsychiatric Patients and Normal Volunteers)&#xD;
      and protocol #91-M-014 (MRI Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Patients and Controls). Separate&#xD;
      consent forms are required for each study. Candidates will undergo medical and psychiatric&#xD;
      evaluations that may include blood and urine tests, electroencephalogram and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers will have a mood assessment at the beginning of the study. They will then&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to take either placebo (a pill with no active ingredient) or St. John's&#xD;
      Wort 3 times a day for 2 weeks, and will be told what they are taking. After an 11-week&#xD;
      hiatus, they will again start treatment on the same schedule, but will not be told which&#xD;
      preparation they are receiving. Each evening during the 2-week treatment periods, subjects&#xD;
      will complete a brief self-rating mood assessment questionnaire. At the end of each treatment&#xD;
      period, they will undergo SPECT brain imaging (a type of CT scan) to determine dopamine and&#xD;
      serotonin distribution and density in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this procedure, study subjects take three drops of potassium iodide solution within 24&#xD;
      hours before the scan and two drops nightly for 3 days following the procedure. About 10 ml&#xD;
      (less than two teaspoons) of blood are drawn before a radioactive tracer is injected. SPECT&#xD;
      imaging is done the next day. After about 1 hour of imaging, subjects are given either a&#xD;
      placebo or St. John's Wort, and then imaging continues for another 2 hours. During the&#xD;
      procedure, up to five blood samples of 6 ml each may be drawn. At some point during the&#xD;
      study, a MRI scan of the brain will be done.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Extracts of hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) have become increasingly popular for the&#xD;
      treatment of mood disorders. Hypericum extracts have been approved in Germany for the&#xD;
      treatment of mild to moderate depression and are now available in standardized preparations.&#xD;
      In the United States, hypericum extracts are frequently purchased as over the counter&#xD;
      preparations. Inhibition of the serotonin transporter, similar to clinically used selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been suggested as a possible mechanism of action&#xD;
      for the antidepressant properties of hypericum extracts. We propose to study the effects of&#xD;
      hypericum extracts on mood states in normal volunteers who are concurrently volunteering&#xD;
      under NIMH protocol 98-M-0094 for SPECT imaging of serotonin and dopamine transporter&#xD;
      availability with [I-123] Beta-CIT. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject design&#xD;
      will be employed with two two-week periods of drug/placebo administration, clinical&#xD;
      assessment and SPECT imaging separated by eleven weeks. We plan to test three hypotheses: 1)&#xD;
      that hypericum alters mood state, 2) that hypericum reduces serotonin transporter&#xD;
      availability, and 3) that these actions are quantitatively associated with one another.&#xD;
