  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia refers to a condition where there is a loss of intellectual function (cognition). It&#xD;
      is usually a progressive condition that interferes with normal social and occupational&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with frontal lobe dementia (FLD) suffer from a destruction of the brain cells found&#xD;
      in the frontal lobe of the brain. Loss of frontal lobe neurons can cause changes in&#xD;
      personality, such as aggressiveness, agitation, and depression. In addition, patients with&#xD;
      FLD may have difficulty planning tasks and may have a loss of motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe that the cells lost in the frontal lobe of the brain are responsible for&#xD;
      producing a chemical called serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, which means it is&#xD;
      used by neurons to communicate with other neurons. Researchers are inclined to believe that&#xD;
      by replacing the missing serotonin, symptoms of FLD may be relieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs known as serotonin uptake inhibitors, help to maintain high levels of serotonin in the&#xD;
      body. They have been used successfully to treat patients with depression and patients with&#xD;
      violent / impulsive behaviors. Sertraline is a serotonin reuptake blocker that is relatively&#xD;
      easy to give (once daily), is safer than most other serotonin reuptake blockers (very little&#xD;
      effect on vital enzyme systems [cytochrome P-450]), and has few interactions with other&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test the effectiveness of Sertraline for the treatment of symptoms&#xD;
      associated with FLD. Patients participating in the study will receive Sertraline for 6 weeks&#xD;
      and a placebo &quot;inactive sugar pill&quot; for 6 weeks. During the study, researchers will test&#xD;
      psychological and neurological functions to measure the effects of the drug.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Degeneration of frontal serotonin-containing neurons occurs in frontal lobe dementia (FLD).&#xD;
      The associated loss of serotonin transmission may contribute to the frontal lobe dysfunction&#xD;
      associated with this disorder. FLD patients will undergo a controlled clinical trial of an&#xD;
      orally administered serotonergic agent (Sertraline) which acts centrally to selectively block&#xD;
      serotonin uptake to treat patients' cognitive and behavioral frontal dysfunction. Study&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated at regular intervals with a battery of neuropsychological and&#xD;
      behavioral tests designed to assess frontal and other cognitive functions. In addition,&#xD;
      compliance and levels of the medication will be measured in the blood and when possible in&#xD;
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;

        Characterized as having behavioral manifestations using a standardized neuropsychiatric&#xD;
        scale and interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        FLD patients' frontal cognitive sysfunctions characterized using a short neurobehavioral&#xD;
        test battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to be tested and cooperative with the procedures required in this&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No contraindications to the use of Sertraline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No medical conditions that can reasonably be expected to subject the patient to unwarranted&#xD;
        risk (e.g., cancer) or require frequent changes in medication. Well-controlled medical&#xD;
        conditions such as hypertension and diabetes will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not be pregnant or nursing and must be using effective contraception, if&#xD;
        still at child-bearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of prior severe traumatic brain injury or other severe neurologic or psychiatric&#xD;
        condition, such as psychosis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not using any psychotropic medication which cannot be stopped 4 weeks before the study.&#xD;
