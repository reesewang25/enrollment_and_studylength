  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of endostatin in treating patients who have advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. Endostatin may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the optimal biologic dose of endostatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine&#xD;
      the extent, frequency, and duration of tumor response in these patients on this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile and interpatient pharmacologic variability of this&#xD;
      regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo a biopsy during prestudy and after the second course of treatment. Patients&#xD;
      receive endostatin IV daily for 4 weeks. Patients on dose level 1-6 receive endostatin over&#xD;
      20 minutes. Patients on dose level 7 receive endostatin over 40 minutes, with no treatment on&#xD;
      day 2 of the first course only. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of&#xD;
      endostatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for 1 month.&#xD;
