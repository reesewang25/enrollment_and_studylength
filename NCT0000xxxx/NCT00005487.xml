      The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) was initiated to study the correlates,&#xD;
      predictors, and progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) (disease detected&#xD;
      non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) in a diverse&#xD;
      population-based sample of men and women aged 45-84 who had no evidence of clinical CVD at&#xD;
      baseline (www.mesa-nhlbi.org). During 2000-2002, 6,814 participants were recruited from six&#xD;
      field centers (Forsyth County, NC; Northern Manhattan and the Bronx, NY; Baltimore City and&#xD;
      Baltimore County, MD; St. Paul, MN; Chicago, IL; and Los Angeles County, CA). The ethnic&#xD;
      composition of the recruited cohort was 38% Caucasian, 28% African American, 22% Hispanic,&#xD;
      and 12% Chinese. An extensive baseline exam focused on critical CVD risk factors and&#xD;
      subclinical disease measures. Five subsequent exams took place through 2018 to assess changes&#xD;
      in these measures and to explore new innovative research questions. Cohort members are&#xD;
      contacted annually to obtain information about intervening hospitalizations and outpatient&#xD;
      cardiovascular-related procedures. Relevant medical records are abstracted and reviewed and&#xD;
      clinical endpoints of interest are adjudicated. The study is comprised of one Coordinating&#xD;
      Center, six Field Centers and one biospecimen repository.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MESA was derived from an NHLBI Task Force on Research in Epidemiology and Prevention in which&#xD;
      investigation of subclinical disease and its progression to clinical disease was recommended&#xD;
      as a major focus for future NHLBI population studies. This was followed by a Special Emphasis&#xD;
      Panel on Longitudinal Cohort Studies in 1995, which strongly recommended studies based on&#xD;
      subclinical disease measures, and the inclusion of underrepresented minorities in&#xD;
      population-based research. A subsequent Special Emphasis Panel on Use of Cardiac EBCT and MRI&#xD;
      in Epidemiologic Studies of Cardiovascular Disease in 1996 recommended inclusion of carotid&#xD;
      and cardiac MRI and EBCT in elucidating the progression of subclinical to clinical disease&#xD;
      and identifying subclinical disease characteristics most strongly associated with increased&#xD;
      risk. Requests for Proposals were released in 1997 and awards were made in 1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Narrative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were examined at baseline for evidence of subclinical CVD using cardiac computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT), cardiac MRI, carotid ultrasound, flow-mediated brachial artery dilation,&#xD;
      radial artery tonometry, ankle-brachial index measurement; established and putative&#xD;
      laboratory risk markers; and socioeconomic, psychological, behavioral, and environmental&#xD;
      characteristics. Selected baseline components were repeated and additional components such as&#xD;
      spirometry, retinal photography, genotyping, cognitive function assessment and, in subsets,&#xD;
      abdominal aortic CT, carotid MRI, cardiac MRI tagging for measures of regional myocardial&#xD;
      function, were introduced over five subsequent examinations through 2018. Stored blood&#xD;
      samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control&#xD;
      studies. DNA has been extracted for study of candidate genes, genome-wide scanning,&#xD;
      expression, and other -omics investigations, and lymphocytes were cryopreserved for possible&#xD;
      immortalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MESA is unique in its composition of four ethnic groups, having a cohort free of clinical CVD&#xD;
      at baseline, and having multiple - and in some cases unique - subclinical CVD measures over&#xD;
      time in the same individuals. Data collected from a large number and variety of MESA&#xD;
      ancillary studies, including major ancillary studies on air pollution, chronic lung disease,&#xD;
      genetics, and sleep, further contribute to its uniqueness. For a list of all phenotypic data&#xD;
      documentation and protocols, refer to the MESA website: www.mesa-nhlbi.org. The MESA data are&#xD;
      available to qualifying investigators directly from the study and also through dbGaP&#xD;
      (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) and BioLINCC (https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov). A variety of&#xD;
      stored biospecimens are also available from the study, including DNA, serum, plasma, and&#xD;
      urine.&#xD;
