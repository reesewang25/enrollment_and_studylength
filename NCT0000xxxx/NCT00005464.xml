      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISH was a multicenter, controlled, randomized study conducted in 1980-1983 of 496 patients,&#xD;
      who were formerly participants in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and who&#xD;
      had their blood pressure well controlled with medication. At DISH baseline they were&#xD;
      randomized to continue medication or to be withdrawn from antihypertensive medication to&#xD;
      determine if weight reduction or sodium restriction/potassium increase interventions could&#xD;
      maintain these people under blood pressure control without drugs. Only the main findings&#xD;
      regarding diastolic blood pressure control under the different diet regimens, were analyzed&#xD;
      and reported during the course of DISH funding. Many questions which could be uniquely&#xD;
      addressed by this comprehensive data base remained unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators explored the questions dealing with demographic, clinical and physiologic&#xD;
      predictors of relapse to the hypertensive state. They also analyzed the mortality experience&#xD;
      of this cohort five years post DISH in relation to the DISH randomization groups and in&#xD;
      relation to success in remaining off drugs during DISH. They did this by querying the&#xD;
      National Death Index to determine who of the DISH participants died following the termination&#xD;
      of DISH.&#xD;
