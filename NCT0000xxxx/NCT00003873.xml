  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil given by infusion&#xD;
      with that of fluorouracil plus eniluracil given by mouth in treating patients who have&#xD;
      metastatic, recurrent, or residual advanced colorectal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use&#xD;
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet&#xD;
      known if fluorouracil is more effective with or without eniluracil for advanced colorectal&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the response rate, response duration, and survival of patients with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer treated with oral fluorouracil (5-FU) and eniluracil or with protracted&#xD;
      infusion 5-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the toxicity of these treatment regimens in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to performance status&#xD;
      (0 vs 1-2) and measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV as a continuous infusion for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive eniluracil/fluorouracil orally twice a day for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment continues every 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at least every 10 weeks for 1 year.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with measurable or nonmeasurable histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
             the colon and rectum are eligible provided patient has metastatic, recurrent or&#xD;
             residual disease, and tumor is beyond hope of surgical eradication; all pre-study&#xD;
             scans documenting disease must be done =&lt; 4 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable tumor is defined as a known mass that can be clearly measured in two&#xD;
                  dimensions by physical examination, CT scan, radionuclide liver scan, or on chest&#xD;
                  x-ray by a ruler or calipers; the largest diameter of the lesion must measure &gt;=&#xD;
                  2 cm by at least one method of evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had no prior therapy for advanced disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had prior adjuvant treatment with 5-FU provided that the last dose&#xD;
             was received &gt; 12 months prior to entering the study; no prior chemotherapy other than&#xD;
             adjuvant 5-FU is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior radiotherapy are acceptable, but patients should have measurable&#xD;
             or nonmeasurable disease outside the radiation port and/or progressive disease within&#xD;
             the previously radiated volume; in addition, it must be at least 2 weeks since&#xD;
             administration of radiation therapy and all signs of toxicity must have abated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGOT =&lt; 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because Eniluracil changes the metabolism of 5-FU such that it is excreted primarily&#xD;
             by the kidneys, an estimated creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcroft and&#xD;
             Gault formula must be obtained in patients with a serum creatinine &gt; institutional&#xD;
             normal limits; the estimated creatinine clearance must be &gt;= 50 ml/min prior to&#xD;
             starting treatment with Eniluracil/5-FU; if not, a measured creatinine clearance must&#xD;
             be done (using a 24 hour urine collection); the measured creatinine clearance must be&#xD;
             &gt; 50 ml/min for the patient to be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 2000 mm³&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000 mm³&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of significant active infection (e.g., pneumonia, peritonitis, wound&#xD;
             abscess, etc.) at time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of serious intercurrent illness such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             hypothyroidism, malabsorption syndrome or heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior neoplastic diseases (within 5 years) aside from the current malignancy or&#xD;
             curatively resected melanoma, skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No treatment with folinic acid, interferon, flucytosine or topical 5-FU within the&#xD;
             previous 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not pregnant or lactating; pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study&#xD;
             because effects on the fetus are unknown and there may be a risk of increased fetal&#xD;
             wastage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use&#xD;
             an accepted and effective method of contraception&#xD;
