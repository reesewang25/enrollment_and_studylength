  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the relative effectiveness of teaching occupational nurses to conduct cholesterol&#xD;
      screening, counseling and referral events (SCOREs) in their own worksites versus using an&#xD;
      external organization to implement these programs. Also. to study the relative effectiveness&#xD;
      of face-to-face behavior change counseling following the cholesterol measurement versus&#xD;
      automated feedback of essentially the same individualized educational material.&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design was a 2 x 2 design with repeated measures at six and 12 months after the&#xD;
      baseline measurement and treatment application. The investigators tested the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness of two major dimensions of blood cholesterol change programming in worksites of&#xD;
      250 - 800 employees with at least one occupational nurse. The overall design was 2 x 2 with&#xD;
      10 of 25 worksites randomly assigned to an Internal Condition and 10 worksites assigned to an&#xD;
      External Condition. In the Internal Condition, occupational nurses were trained by project&#xD;
      staff to implement the SCOREs and were given Reflotron portable dry chemistry analyzers to&#xD;
      measure cholesterol. In the External Condition, the SCORE was conducted by an external&#xD;
      organization (project staff). Five (5) worksites from each of the above conditions had the&#xD;
      educational session of the SCORE delivered face-to-face [Face-to-Face condition (FF)] by&#xD;
      either the nurse or project staff, depending on the condition (Internal + FF or External +&#xD;
      FF). The other 10 worksites had this education delivered by a microcomputer/optical scanner&#xD;
      (the RT 2000) that read the participant's risk factor and self-reported eating pattern&#xD;
      information and delivered a print-out with recommendations that were prioritized and&#xD;
      individualized for the participant (RT intervention was delivered by the nurse or project&#xD;
      staff depending on the condition (Internal + RT or External + RT). All SCORE participants in&#xD;
      the above 20 worksites also received a self-help nutrition change kit. This cross design&#xD;
      allowed testing for possible interaction effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another group of five worksites was also included which served as a comparison group for the&#xD;
      External Condition. The employees in this group received a screening and education experience&#xD;
      similar to the usual type of program offered by external, commercial screeners with minimal&#xD;
      written education materials and no individualized feedback (Usual Care External Condition).&#xD;
      The primary dependent variables included measured blood cholesterol, weight, other CHD risk&#xD;
      factors, and self-reported eating pattern. Change were assessed six and 12 months after the&#xD;
      SCOREs were conducted. A wide range of other variables including process, cost and mediating&#xD;
      variables were assessed through the project period.&#xD;
