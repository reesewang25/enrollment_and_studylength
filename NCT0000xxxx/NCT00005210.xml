    <textblock>
      To prospectively explore the relationships of endogenous sex steroid hormones and obesity and&#xD;
      their interactions with lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein levels in nine and ten&#xD;
      year old Black and white adolescent girls for five years during puberty.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1987, there was growing evidence that androgens, particularly when elevated, had an&#xD;
      unfavorable effect on lipo/apo levels, tending to lower HDL cholesterol (HDLC) and raise LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDLC). Previous studies confirmed that although pre-pubertal boys and girls had&#xD;
      similar lipo/apo levels, post-pubertal boys had a higher ratio of LDLC/HDLC than girls, in&#xD;
      part because of their androgen levels. Such lipo/apo levels had been associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of coronary heart disease. There was also evidence that obese girls tended to&#xD;
      be hyperandrogenic and thus had unfavorable lipo/apo levels and a higher risk of coronary&#xD;
      heart disease. This study sought to elucidate whether high androgen levels preceded or were a&#xD;
      consequence of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal study was ancillary to the National Growth and Health Study (NGHS), a&#xD;
      multicenter study which investigated the occurrence of obesity in Black and white adolescent&#xD;
      girls, predictors of the transition to the obese state, the correlates of the transition, and&#xD;
      the relationship of the transition to other coronary heart disease risk factors. As part of&#xD;
      the NGHS, participants from the Cincinnati, Ohio and Washington, D.C. public and parochial&#xD;
      schools received physical examinations with attention to pubertal staging and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements including weight, height, and skinfold thickness. Along with NGHS blood samples,&#xD;
      additional blood was obtained in years 1, 3, and 5 for measurements of lipids, lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterols, apolipoproteins A1, A2, and B, and sex steroid hormones including plasma total&#xD;
      and free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, and testosterone estrogen&#xD;
      binding globulin.&#xD;
