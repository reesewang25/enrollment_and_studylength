  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving the ALVAC vCP1452 anti-HIV vaccine alone or&#xD;
      with another vaccine called AIDSVAX B/B to babies of HIV-positive mothers is safe. The study&#xD;
      will also look at how these vaccines affect a baby's immune system. Most HIV-positive&#xD;
      children get HIV from their mothers during pregnancy or birth. Treatment with anti-HIV drugs&#xD;
      can reduce the baby's risk of getting HIV. Vaccines also may help prevent HIV infection. This&#xD;
      study will look at whether the ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine and the AIDSVAX B/B vaccine can help the&#xD;
      body fight off HIV infection. There is no chance of getting HIV infection from the vaccines.&#xD;
      (This study has been changed. In earlier versions, ALVAC vCP205 and AIDSVAX B/E were going to&#xD;
      be used.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transmission of HIV from an untreated infected mother to her offspring is thought to occur to&#xD;
      some infants perinatally and others at parturition. It is possible that administration of an&#xD;
      immunogenic vaccine can reduce the vertical transmission of HIV-1 or moderate its course in&#xD;
      infected infants. Successful early sensitization to HIV epitopes might succeed in preventing&#xD;
      HIV infection. Alternately, the enhancement of HIV-specific immune function might also&#xD;
      succeed in modifying HIV replication and affecting disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty infants are treated in this randomized, double-blind study; 45 infants receive&#xD;
      recombinant Canarypox virus, ALVAC-HIV vCP205, and 15 receive placebo. Mothers serve as proxy&#xD;
      for their infants. All infants receive a minimum of four immunizations, at Weeks 0 (within 72&#xD;
      hours of birth), 4, 8, and 12. Initially, 24 patients are randomized to receive one of two&#xD;
      doses of vCP205 or a saline placebo. When a suitable subunit vaccine is available, the&#xD;
      protocol will be amended and 36 additional infants will be randomized to receive vCP205 alone&#xD;
      or with a subunit vaccine at Weeks 4 and 8 (or vaccine placebo with or without subunit&#xD;
      placebo). [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/5/97: 18 infants receive ALVAC-HIV vCP205 at one of two doses&#xD;
      and 6 receive placebo.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/9/99: Cohort 1 received vCP205. Cohort 2 received&#xD;
      a higher dose of vCP205. Cohort A received vCP205 placebo (saline). Cohorts 1, 2, and A were&#xD;
      double-blinded and closed to accrual in March 1999. As of September 1999, infants are&#xD;
      randomized to one of four new cohorts. Cohort 3 receives vCP1452 at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.&#xD;
      Cohort 4 receives vCP1452 at Weeks 0 and 4, then receives vCP1452 plus AIDSVAX B/E gp120 at&#xD;
      Weeks 8 and 12. Cohort B receives vCP1452 placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Cohort C receives&#xD;
      vCP1452 placebo at Weeks 0 and 4, then receives vCP1452 placebo plus AIDSVAX B/E placebo at&#xD;
      Weeks 8 and 12. All infants are followed every 2 weeks for the first 14 weeks of life, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months until age 2. Cord blood is used to establish autologous B cell lines, and&#xD;
      CTL assays are performed to characterize the immune response to HIV. In addition, CD4 count,&#xD;
      viral load, and mucosal antibody responses are measured. Immunized infants who are not&#xD;
      infected with HIV serve as controls for the immunogenicity of the vaccines in the infected&#xD;
      infants.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/24/00: AIDSVAX B/E has been replaced with AIDSVAX B/B.]&#xD;
