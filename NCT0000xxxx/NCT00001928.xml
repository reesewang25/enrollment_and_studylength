  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease have low levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine&#xD;
      is responsible for motor function and normal physical activity. Patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease typically suffer from tremors, rigid muscles, stooped postures, and walk with a&#xD;
      shuffle. The drug levodopa acts as a replacement for dopamine and has been has been used&#xD;
      effectively for over 30 years as treatment for Parkinsons disease. Because of its&#xD;
      effectiveness, levodopa has been used to distinguish Parkinson's disease from other&#xD;
      conditions that may resemble Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, levodopa has been given as a pill. In this study, researchers would like to&#xD;
      inject levodopa directly into a vein (intravenous) in order to diagnose cases of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. This method provides immediate results and allows doctors to adjust the dose of&#xD;
      levodopa very carefully. Because the intravenous method of giving levodopa is less practical&#xD;
      than oral medication, it is not an available alternative for the routine treatment of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. However, it may be useful for faster diagnosis of the disease and for&#xD;
      determining effective doses of oral medication.&#xD;

      A positive response to levodopa is now considered a condition sine qua non for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Under this protocol, patients with parkinsonism of&#xD;
      uncertain etiology will be tested for their motor response to intravenous levodopa to aid in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This protocol regulates and stipulates the acute&#xD;
      administration of intravenous levodopa and associated safety issues.&#xD;
