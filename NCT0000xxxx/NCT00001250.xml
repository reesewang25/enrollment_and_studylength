  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with untreated clinical stage II breast cancer are eligible. An excisional biopsy of&#xD;
      the primary tumor is acceptable, but without definitive local therapy or prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Histologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma is required. Patients are prospectively&#xD;
      randomized to receive five 21-day cycles of dose-intense (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin,&#xD;
      leucovorin, cytoxan, granuloctye-colony stimulating factor [FLAC/G-CSF]) chemotherapy either&#xD;
      before (preoperative) or after (postoperative) local therapy. Chemotherapy is given as an&#xD;
      outpatient. For patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, local therapy (modified radical&#xD;
      mastectomy, or breast segmentectomy/axillary dissection/breast radiotherapy according to&#xD;
      patient preference) is performed 3-4 weeks after last chemotherapy. For patients receiving&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy, chemotherapy will begin 2-3 weeks after local therapy. Immediate&#xD;
      reconstruction for mastectomy is acceptable. Upon completion of local therapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy in either treatment group, all estrogen receptor positive patients receive&#xD;
      tamoxifen for 5 years. Follow-up consists of history and physical examination each 3 months&#xD;
      for first 3 years, each six months for years 4 and 5, and yearly thereafter. Mammogram, bone&#xD;
      scan, chest x-ray and blood work are performed yearly.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized trial evaluating the effect of preoperative dose intense&#xD;
      chemotherapy (FLAC/G-CSF) on axillary lymph node metastases in women with clinical stage II&#xD;
      (T1N1, T2N0, T2N1) breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive 5 cycles of&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy (5-FU, adriamycin, leucovorin, cytoxan, G-CSF) either as initial&#xD;
      therapy (preoperative) or postoperatively after local therapy (modified radical mastectomy or&#xD;
      lumpectomy/axillary lymph node dissection/whole breast radiotherapy). Each chemotherapy cycle&#xD;
      will be 21 days. At the time of local therapy the incidence of axillary metastases in the&#xD;
      axillary dissection specimen will be determined and compared in the preoperative chemotherapy&#xD;
      vs. postoperative chemotherapy treatment groups.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of any age with clinical stage II breast cancer who met the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with stage II breast cancer will include primary tumor less than or equal to 5 cm&#xD;
        in size with axillary lymph nodes which are clinically ([N0 or N1] [T1N1, T2N0, T2N1]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be staged according to the 1986 AJCC TMM classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with bilateral breast cancer will be eligible provided at least one tumor is&#xD;
        invasive and classified as stage I or II, and neither breast is stage III.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologic sections of the breast tumor must be classified as an invasive primary breast&#xD;
        neoplasm of epithelial origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be geographically accessible for follow-up and willing to return for the&#xD;
        follow-up at the NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be mentally competent to understand and give informed consent for the&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Estrogen receptor (ER) status can include ER positive, negative, or unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with prior cancers may be eligible as long as they have received curative therapy&#xD;
        and have had no evidence of recurrence for greater than or equal to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from this protocol for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Advanced local disease or distant metastases (stage III or IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous therapy to the breast other than excisional biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unwillingness to use birth control during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chronic disease such as heart, lung, liver, kidney, blood or metabolic disorders which may&#xD;
        render the patient a poor risk for surgery or chemotherapy. Specifically, liver function -&#xD;
        SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin should be less than 1.5 x the upper&#xD;
        limits of normal. Renal function - creatinine should be less than 1.7 and/or creatinine&#xD;
        clearance should be greater than 45 ml/min. If there is any history of cardiac disease,&#xD;
        patients must have a normal ejection fraction on MUGA scan and no angina.&#xD;
