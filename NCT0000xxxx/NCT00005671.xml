    <textblock>
      This study will examine the health-related quality of life in patients being treated for&#xD;
      chronic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years or older with chronic ischemic heart disease and left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction enrolled in protocols in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's Cardiology&#xD;
      Branch may participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete five questionnaires at 3 separate times during the study-once&#xD;
      during hospitalization at the NIH Clinical Center and again at home 6 months and 1 year&#xD;
      later. The questionnaires, described below, require a total of about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic Information Sheet -General information such as age, marital status,&#xD;
           employment, education, and history of cardiac medical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General Health Survey -Patient's self-assessment, on a rating scale, of physical and&#xD;
           emotional well being. Questions are related to the ability to perform work and daily&#xD;
           living activities, mood and state of mind, limitations on social activities, energy&#xD;
           level, pain level, general quality of life, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heart Disease Survey - Patient's self-assessment, on a rating scale, of the level of&#xD;
           physical, social, emotional and functional well being related to his or her heart&#xD;
           condition. Questions concern fatigue level, emotional outlook, social well being, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Angina Survey - Information on the frequency of chest pain, chest tightness, or angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Symptom Distress Survey - Patient's ranking of the degree of symptom distress from chest&#xD;
           discomfort, difficulty breathing, heart rate irregularities, wheezing and coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information provided in the questionnaires will be kept confidential. Upon request,&#xD;
      patients will be sent a summary of the study results when the study is completed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A majority of the research in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction deals with increasing patient survival rates and years. Very little&#xD;
      research has focused on patients' perceptions of living with this chronic debilitating&#xD;
      disease. The purpose of this naturalistic, prospective study is to assess the Health Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life (HRQOL), anginal symptoms and symptom distress experienced by patients with&#xD;
      chronic ischemic heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction. The relationship between&#xD;
      underlying cardiac condition, anginal symptoms, symptom distress and HRQOL will be examined.&#xD;
      The trend in HRQOL across time versus treatment group will be evaluated. The question, does&#xD;
      HRQOL, anginal frequency and symptom distress at baseline predict mortality and cardiac&#xD;
      related hospitalization during the year following assessment will also be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are enrolled in protocols in the Cardiology Branch of the National Heart Lung&#xD;
      and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and diagnosed with chronic ischemic heart disease and left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction will be asked to participate in this HRQOL study. Patients will&#xD;
      complete measures of HRQOL (Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey; Minnesota Living with&#xD;
      Heart Failure Questionnaire) and symptom measures (anginal frequency subscale of the Seattle&#xD;
      Angina Questionnaire; cardiopulmonary subscale of the Heart Transplant Symptom Checklist).&#xD;
      Underlying cardiac condition will be assessed using exercise thallium imaging parameters&#xD;
      (METS and perfusion defects) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging parameter&#xD;
      (viability). A sample size of 90 subjects is desired for this study. Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      using multivariate statistics. It is expected that this study will provide new information&#xD;
      regarding how patients with ischemic heart disease and left ventricular function feel their&#xD;
      chronic illness and its corresponding treatment(s) affects their HRQOL.&#xD;
