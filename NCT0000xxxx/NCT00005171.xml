      To describe secular trends in cardiovascular risk factors in the adolescent and adult United&#xD;
      States population and to identify and quantify the changes in variables related to these risk&#xD;
      factors. Also, to modify and implement the statistical methodology available for the analysis&#xD;
      of complex sample survey data in order to model and test these secular trends across separate&#xD;
      nationally representative databases. The differences in risk factors in these samples were&#xD;
      contrasted with those from a special population group, Hispanic Americans.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1985 when the study was initiated, there were surprisingly little data on the distribution&#xD;
      of risk factors among subgroups of the population and the changes occurring over time. These&#xD;
      issues assumed greater importance as the decline in coronary heart disease mortality focused&#xD;
      interest on the role of primary prevention through alteration of risk factors. In review of&#xD;
      the potential contributions to this decline, it was noted that cessation of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, better blood pressure control and decrease in total serum cholesterol may have&#xD;
      accounted partially for the decline in coronary heart disease mortality. However, these&#xD;
      observations overlooked the possibility that observations in the total population or confined&#xD;
      to specific socioeconomic groups may fail to disclose differential changes in particular&#xD;
      population segments. For example, Americans in the higher educational and income groups&#xD;
      experienced rapid and marked changes in risk behaviors while less educated, lower income&#xD;
      Americans or specific racial/ethnic groups experienced no beneficial changes. The majority of&#xD;
      cohort studies followed rather select groups and most cross-sectional surveys also had little&#xD;
      sociodemographic variability. However, focusing public health, educational and medical&#xD;
      intervention efforts required that particular groups at greater risk or experiencing less&#xD;
      beneficial secular change be identified and targeted for greater efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trends in blood pressure, serum lipids, and cigarette smoking were described in nationally&#xD;
      representative samples of adolescents ages 12 to 17 and in young adults ages 18 to 24 using&#xD;
      data from surveys conducted from 1960 to 1984 by the National Center for Health Statistics&#xD;
      (NCHS). Trends in blood pressure, serum lipids, cigarette smoking, and obesity were described&#xD;
      in nationally representative samples of older adults ages 35 to 75 using NCHS survey data.&#xD;
      The national surveys used included National Health Examination Surveys (NHES-I and III), the&#xD;
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES I and II) and Hispanic NHANES. The&#xD;
      secular trends in these risk factors were contrasted by subgroupings of age, race, sex,&#xD;
      family income, and education. The correlates of these risk factors were determined and&#xD;
      secular changes over time were identified and quantified. Risk factor values and their&#xD;
      correlates in the national population sample were contrasted with the three Hispanic&#xD;
      populations surveyed in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES).&#xD;
      Statistical methodologies were refined including statistical software for the analysis of&#xD;
      complete sample survey data, model fitting strategies to characterize the secular trends&#xD;
      across four national surveys, and guidelines for the choice of analytical strategies.&#xD;
