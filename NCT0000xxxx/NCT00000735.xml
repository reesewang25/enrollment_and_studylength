  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of intravenous infusion of ampligen in symptomatic HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients at several dose levels, to determine the maximum dose that can be tolerated, and to&#xD;
      measure the effects of ampligen on the HIV virus infection, immune function, and clinical&#xD;
      condition. Ampligen is a suitable drug for clinical trials against HIV because it has been&#xD;
      shown to stimulate the immune system and to inhibit replication of HIV in vitro at doses that&#xD;
      can be achieved without noticeable harmful side effects.&#xD;

      Ampligen is a suitable drug for clinical trials against HIV because it has been shown to&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system and to inhibit replication of HIV in vitro at doses that can be&#xD;
      achieved without noticeable harmful side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients entered in the study are given ampligen by intravenous infusion at hemophilia&#xD;
      treatment centers once during the first week of the trial and twice a week during the&#xD;
      following 12 weeks. The dose each patient receives is determined by the responses of earlier&#xD;
      patients. If the status of the HIV infection does not improve after the first 13 weeks,&#xD;
      ampligen will be stopped. Each patient maintains a daily diary listing any symptoms or&#xD;
      problems that occur such as headache, nausea, or change in appetite. Other anti-HIV drugs&#xD;
      cannot be taken during the trial, and aspirin or acetaminophen should not be taken for more&#xD;
      than 72 hours at any time during the trial without consulting the research staff. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn at intervals during the 13-week trial and 8-week follow-up and used to determine the&#xD;
      effect of ampligen on HIV and the immune system as well as to monitor toxicity and side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
