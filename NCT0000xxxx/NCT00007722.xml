      Recently, concern has arisen regarding a possible elevated occurrence of ALS among veterans&#xD;
      who served in the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Shield (August 2, 1990 - January 15,&#xD;
      1991), Desert Storm (January 16, 1991 - February 28, 1991) and Clean-up (March 1, 1991 - July&#xD;
      31, 1991). This study involves an epidemiologic investigation into the occurrence of ALS&#xD;
      among veterans of the Gulf War. This study will further define the epidemiology of this&#xD;
      neurological disease among younger individuals while determining whether there is a higher&#xD;
      than expected occurrence. It will also ascertain the etiologic importance of deployment to&#xD;
      the Persian Gulf and exposure to specific environmental factors in that geographic area. VA&#xD;
      is leading this joint federal government epidemiologic study that also involves DoD, HHS,&#xD;
      CDC, and academic centers of excellence in neurology, with advice from the ALS Association.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives: To develop, through nationwide ascertainment, a comprehensive descriptive&#xD;
      epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) among Gulf War veterans with particular&#xD;
      attention to whether there is a higher than expected occurrence of ALS among deployed&#xD;
      veterans as compared to non-deployed Gulf War veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To ascertain probable/possible etiologic factors with particular focus&#xD;
      on the role of chemical or biologic factors in the Persian Gulf area of deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: Incidence of ALS among deployed and non-deployed veterans of the Gulf War.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Abstract: Recently, concern has arisen regarding a possible elevated occurrence of ALS&#xD;
      among veterans who served in the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Shield (August 2, 1990&#xD;
      - January 15, 1991), Desert Storm (January 16, 1991 - February 28, 1991) and Clean-up (March&#xD;
      1, 1991 - July 31, 1991). In response to this concern, a nationwide epidemiological&#xD;
      investigation was conducted to ascertain all occurrences of ALS between August, 1990 and&#xD;
      July, 2000 among all active duty military and mobilized Reserves, including National Guard,&#xD;
      who served during the Gulf War period (August 2, 1990-July 31, 1991). A diagnosis of ALS was&#xD;
      confirmed by medical record review and, as necessary, neurological examination. Risk was&#xD;
      assessed by the age-adjusted, average, annual 10-year cumulative incidence rate. VA led this&#xD;
      joint federal government epidemiologic study that also involved DoD, HHS, CDC, and academic&#xD;
      centers of excellence in neurology, with advice from the ALS Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population was defined as all active duty military and mobilized reserves and&#xD;
      National Guard who served for at least one month at any time during the Gulf War period.&#xD;
      Mobilized reservists and members of the National Guard were those who were activated and&#xD;
      called-up, being either deployed to S.W. Asia or &quot;back-filling&quot; positions of military&#xD;
      personnel who were deployed. Deployed military personnel were those who served in the S.W.&#xD;
      Asian theater during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm or the period immediately&#xD;
      after Desert Storm or received hazardous duty pay during the Gulf War. All other individuals&#xD;
      in the study population were classified as non-deployed, although they may have been&#xD;
      stationed outside the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has as its primary component a field epidemiological investigation, involving&#xD;
      nationwide ascertainment of ALS cases among deployed and non-deployed veterans of the Gulf&#xD;
      War to obtain a census of ALS cases among these populations. Ascertainment of cases occurred&#xD;
      through three avenues. The first was a search of extant VA and DoD medical databases. Second,&#xD;
      we solicited cases from the ALS Association, other related organizations, and from VA and DoD&#xD;
      neurology clinics. And third, we identified cases through self-referrals that resulted from&#xD;
      national media announcements. Purported cases were verified via medical record review and, as&#xD;
      necessary, a detailed clinical examination. For all living cases, we are collecting a sample&#xD;
      of blood and urine for determination of ALS-relevant DNA mutations and heavy metal exposure,&#xD;
      respectively. There is also an in-home visit that includes an interview of the patient and&#xD;
      family members with emphasis on ascertainment of unique exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: In this large epidemiological study, researchers supported by both the Department of&#xD;
      VA and DoD have found preliminary evidence that veterans who served in Desert Shield-Desert&#xD;
      Storm are nearly twice as likely as their non-deployed counterparts to develop ALS. VA is&#xD;
      exploring options for compensating veterans who served in the Gulf and who subsequently&#xD;
      develop ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing Surveillance: The study team has implemented an ongoing surveillance system to detect&#xD;
      future cases of ALS that develop in this veteran population. This system involves maintaining&#xD;
      the linkages created to detect current cases. New cases will be subject to the same protocols&#xD;
      for verification, enrollment and data collection as in the original case ascertainment study.&#xD;
