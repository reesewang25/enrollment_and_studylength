  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the drug zidovudine (AZT) in children, including study of drug&#xD;
      levels in various parts of the body fluids, safety of the drug, and its effect on different&#xD;
      parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of any drug, the way a drug enters the bloodstream, the way it is used by the&#xD;
      body, and the way the body eliminates the drug may be very different in children compared&#xD;
      with adults. The largest group of children who have AIDS are those who are less than 2 years&#xD;
      of age. AIDS is often first identified in infants who are about 6 months old. Studies of AZT&#xD;
      show that it might be useful in the treatment of AIDS. Thus it is important to study the&#xD;
      effects of the drug in children.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients are hospitalized for 8 weeks to receive AZT through the intravenous (IV) route at 1&#xD;
      of 2 doses. Patients are then discharged from hospital and take AZT by mouth for 4 more&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
