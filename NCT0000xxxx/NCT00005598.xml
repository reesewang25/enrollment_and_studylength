      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Amifostine may improve blood counts in patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome. Combining azacitidine with amifostine may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of azacitidine plus amifostine in treating&#xD;
      patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to azacitidine plus amifostine in patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these&#xD;
      patients. III. Assess the rate of progression to acute myeloid leukemia and overall survival&#xD;
      in these patients treated with this regimen. IV. Evaluate the relationship between response&#xD;
      status and cytogenetics, FAB class, ras mutations, and the presence of nonclonal&#xD;
      hematopoiesis with this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Assess the effect of this&#xD;
      treatment regimen on the number of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells in these&#xD;
      patients. VI. Evaluate neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis in these patients before and after&#xD;
      this treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive amifostine IV over 1-3 minutes on days 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22,&#xD;
      24, and 26 plus azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4&#xD;
      courses. Patients who achieve complete remission receive an additional 3 courses, and&#xD;
      patients who achieve hematologic improvement or partial remission continue treatment until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-32 patients will be accrued for this study within&#xD;
      approximately 2 years.&#xD;
