    <textblock>
      Effective treatment and prevention strategies for childhood stroke and porencephaly can only&#xD;
      be developed once the causes are understood. There is increasing evidence that inherited and&#xD;
      acquired coagulation abnormalities alone or in combination with environmental factors,&#xD;
      predispose to arterial and venous thrombosis. Inherited abnormalities of factor V Leiden,&#xD;
      prothrombin, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III may account for many of these&#xD;
      thromboses. At present there is little information on the existing distribution of these&#xD;
      coagulation anomalies in children with thrombosis. Recent reports also suggest that these&#xD;
      clotting abnormalities may be responsible for some instances of intracranial hemorrhage,&#xD;
      porencephaly, cerebral palsy and fetal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure the frequency of several coagulation factor abnormalities (factor V&#xD;
      Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and antiphospholipid&#xD;
      antibodies) in children with a history of porencephaly and stroke, and will compare these to&#xD;
      the prevalence of these mutations in population controls and family members. We will also&#xD;
      describe the exogenous conditions which in concert with these coagulation factors, may have&#xD;
      led to the development of thrombosis in these children....&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective treatment and prevention strategies for childhood stroke and porencephaly can only&#xD;
      be developed once the causes are understood. There is increasing evidence that inherited and&#xD;
      acquired coagulation abnormalities, alone or in combination with environmental factors,&#xD;
      predispose to arterial and venous thrombosis. Inherited abnormalities of factor V leiden,&#xD;
      prothrombin, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III may account for many of these&#xD;
      thromboses. At present there is little information on the existing distribution of these&#xD;
      coagulation anomalies in children with thrombosis. Recent reports suggest that these clotting&#xD;
      abnormalities may be responsible for some instances of intracranial hemorrhage, porencephaly,&#xD;
      cerebral palsy and fetal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this protocol are: 1) to determine the frequency of coagulation&#xD;
      abnormalities in children with porencephaly or stroke as compared to healthy children, 2) to&#xD;
      determine the frequency of coagulation abnormalities in children with porencephaly or stroke&#xD;
      as compared to their family members, 3) to determine the frequency of coagulation&#xD;
      abnormalities in mothers of children with stroke as compared to mothers of healthy children,&#xD;
      and 4) to describe the exogenous conditions, which in concert with coagulation factors, may&#xD;
      have led to the development of thrombosis in children with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine: 1) children with a history of porencephaly or stroke, 2) their&#xD;
      biological mothers, fathers, and siblings, 3) healthy volunteer children, and 4) healthy&#xD;
      volunteer mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case-control study conducted at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders&#xD;
      and Stroke. Children with a history of porencephaly or stroke before 18 years of life, their&#xD;
      first-degree relatives, healthy volunteer children, and healthy volunteer mothers will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Each subject may complete a blood draw, buccal smear, questionnaire, and/or review&#xD;
      of medical records depending on their study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure the frequency of several coagulation factors among the study's&#xD;
      different population groups as well as examine the exogenous conditions that may have&#xD;
      contributed to stroke in these children. Analysis will be descriptive and quantitative.&#xD;
