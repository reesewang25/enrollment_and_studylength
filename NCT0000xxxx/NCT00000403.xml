  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether doxycycline decreases the severity or rate of progression&#xD;
      of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the&#xD;
      most popular agents used to treat OA, but elderly women, in whom OA is especially common, are&#xD;
      at greatest risk of developing serious side effects from NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study targets overweight middle-aged women who have OA in one knee. Half of the 432 study&#xD;
      participants will receive the treatment (doxycycline) and half will receive a placebo&#xD;
      (inactive pill). Treatment with doxycycline (or placebo) will last 30 months, and&#xD;
      participants and researchers will not know who is receiving doxycycline and who is receiving&#xD;
      placebo until the end of the study. We will look for narrowing of the joint space in the knee&#xD;
      that was not affected by OA at the start of the study. Joint space narrowing is a sign of OA.&#xD;
      We will also use questionnaires to evaluate participants' symptoms and functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trial of doxycycline on&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) progression. Our previous research suggests that doxycycline might help&#xD;
      prevent or slow OA development by reducing breakdown of cartilage in joints. The target&#xD;
      population is one that is at high risk for the development of bilateral knee OA: overweight&#xD;
      middle-aged women with unilateral knee OA at baseline. We hypothesize that doxycycline will&#xD;
      decrease the severity or rate of progression of OA. We are recruiting 432 study participants&#xD;
      across six clinical centers and randomizing them to treatment or placebo groups&#xD;
      (N=216/group). Participants will receive either doxycycline (treatment) or placebo for 30&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use several strategies to maximize compliance with the study medications and&#xD;
      retention of participants in the study, including a &quot;faintness-of-heart&quot; test, which will be&#xD;
      used at the outset to eliminate people unlikely to comply, and use of a computerized medicine&#xD;
      cap to provide information on compliance with the prescribed dosing regimen between visits.&#xD;
      These strategies will permit study personnel to aim their efforts to enhance compliance at&#xD;
      those participants who can best benefit from these efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable is minimum joint space width (or joint space narrowing, JSN) in&#xD;
      the medial tibiofemoral compartment of the knee that is normal at baseline. In addition, we&#xD;
      will examine changes in an algofunctional index (WOMAC), global arthritis activity, general&#xD;
      health status (SF-36), and use of health services in the two treatment groups.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women 45-64 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upper tertile of sex-, age- and race-adjusted norms for body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unilateral knee OA at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal status or otherwise incapable of childbearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to ambulate (move about) independently without assistive devices.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal status (unless subject has had a hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any investigational drug.&#xD;

          -  Significant hematologic, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease (but not including&#xD;
             mild/moderate hypertension) or any other serious medical condition that might preclude&#xD;
             the subject's ability to participate fully in the project, keep clinic appointments,&#xD;
             etc.&#xD;

          -  Prior surgery (including arthroscopy) of the contralateral knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significantly abnormal laboratory values at the time of enrollment.&#xD;

             spinal or hip arthritis, painful or dysfunctional feet, peripheral vascular disease,&#xD;
             lumbar radiculopathy, stroke, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Steroid injection into either knee within past 3 months.&#xD;
