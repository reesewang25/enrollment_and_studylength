  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is extremely important to identify and distinguish healthy brain tissue from diseased&#xD;
      brain tissue during neurosurgery. If normal tissue is damaged during neurosurgery it can&#xD;
      result in long term neurological problems for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain tissue as it appears prior to the operation on CT scan and MRI is occasionally very&#xD;
      different from how it appears during the actual operation. Therefore, it is necessary to&#xD;
      develop diagnostic procedures that can be used during the operation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, the techniques used for intraoperative mapping of the brain are not reliable in&#xD;
      all cases in which they are used. Researchers in this study have developed a new approach&#xD;
      that may allow diseased brain tissue to be located during an operation with little risk. This&#xD;
      new approach uses nfrared technology to locate the diseased tissue and identify healthy brain&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to investigate the clinical use of intraoperative infrared (IR)&#xD;
      neuroimaging to locate diseased tissue and distinguish it from normal functioning tissue&#xD;
      during the operation.&#xD;

      It is important during neurosurgical procedures to identify and preserve eloquent functional&#xD;
      cortex adjacent to a resectable lesion. Resection of a lesion infiltrating vital cerebral&#xD;
      cortex can be associated with postoperative neurological deficits if the surgeon cannot&#xD;
      clearly distinguish between the infiltrating borders of a lesion and surrounding functionally&#xD;
      eloquent tissue. Spatial relationships between a lesion and surrounding normal brain can&#xD;
      change significantly from those determined by preoperative methods such as CT and MRI scans.&#xD;
      Necessary intraoperative interventions such as cerebrospinal fluid drainage, osmotic diuresis&#xD;
      and lesion debulking cause quantitatively unpredictable brain shift in three dimensions.&#xD;
      Therefore functional localization in real time that can be performed in the operating room is&#xD;
      desirable. However, intraoperative real-time functional mapping techniques now available&#xD;
      cannot be used in many surgical situations and are not sufficiently reliable in all cases in&#xD;
      which they are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed an intraoperative approach that may permit reliable lesion localization and&#xD;
      brain functional mapping in real time with minimal risk. This approach makes use of infrared&#xD;
      technology to identify functionally active eloquent cortex and may differentiate abnormal&#xD;
      tissue from normal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to investigate the clinical use of intraoperative infrared (IR)&#xD;
      neuroimaging to differentiate intracranial lesions from surrounding normal functionally&#xD;
      important tissue in real time. Reliable real-time intraoperative functional mapping of&#xD;
      eloquent cortex adjacent to lesions by this technique would improve the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of many neurosurgical procedures.&#xD;
