      To conduct a longitudinal investigation of early childhood lower respiratory illness (LRI)&#xD;
      and patterns of lung growth using an existing electronic dataset generated by an 18-year&#xD;
      study (1972-1990) of a population of 102 Black children followed from birth at the Frank&#xD;
      Porter Graham Child Development Center.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study should improve knowledge of the patterns of functional lung development during&#xD;
      childhood and factors that influence both relative level and growth rate of lung function in&#xD;
      Black children and should offer new understanding of the predictive value of spirometric&#xD;
      tests of lung function performed at an early age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used a previously existing database which was of unique value because it included&#xD;
      comprehensive respiratory illness data collected on-site during the children's tenure in the&#xD;
      Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center's daycare facility and spirometric data&#xD;
      collected longitudinally from three to 13 years of age. Furthermore, the measurements were&#xD;
      for children in a racial group for whom limited cross-sectional or longitudinal spirometric&#xD;
      data were available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal analyses had two primary objectives. The first was to characterize patterns&#xD;
      of functional lung development in Black children from three to 13 years of age and relate&#xD;
      these patterns to potentially influential factors such as (a) wheezing and non-wheezing&#xD;
      associated LRI experience during the infant (ages 0 to two) and preschool (ages two to five)&#xD;
      years, (b) ages of occurrence of first and subsequent LRI episodes, and (c) respiratory&#xD;
      syncytial virus etiology of LRI. Potentially confounding factors included prenatal and&#xD;
      childhood exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and allergies. The second objective was to&#xD;
      determine the degree to which spirometric parameters 'track' for individual children and for&#xD;
      populations of children over the interval from three to 13 years of age. This objective&#xD;
      required assessment of the degree to which spirometric evaluations during the preschool years&#xD;
      were predictive of later lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses for achieving these objectives used recently developed statistical&#xD;
      methods based on the general linear mixed model. By design, these methods for longitudinal&#xD;
      data handled unbalanced data with missing values, incorporated time-varying covariates, and&#xD;
      provided more exactly the extent to which the level of lung function of individual children&#xD;
      was maintained relative to that of other study children and determined the value of preschool&#xD;
      spirometric measurements as predictors of levels of spirometric performance during later&#xD;
      childhood and adolescence. These analyses utilized methods developed by Stewart, Pekow,&#xD;
      Burchinal, and Helms in 1991 that were unique in that they were designed to handle&#xD;
      incomplete, inconsistently-timed data as well as complete, balanced data.&#xD;
