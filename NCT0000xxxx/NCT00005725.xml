  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop and demonstrate the efficacy of a set of original, cardiovascular (CVD) nutrition&#xD;
      education materials designed to reduce intake of sodium (Na) fat, and cholesterol and which&#xD;
      would be appropriate for urban Black adults with 5th to 8th grade reading levels.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was part of an NHLBI initiative on &quot;CVD Nutrition Education for Low Literacy&#xD;
      Skills&quot;. The initiative originated within the Prevention and Demonstration Branch of the&#xD;
      DECA, was approved by the September 1988 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council,&#xD;
      and released in July 1990.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials were designed to accomplish the objectives of conventional nutrition&#xD;
      education/behavior change programs, but avoiding the usual dependency of traditional programs&#xD;
      on strategies that required a high level of reading and arithmetic. Guiding principles were:&#xD;
      the need to identify the food related conceptual, cultural, and social frameworks of members&#xD;
      of the target audience; and develop a program that built upon already-developed, alternative&#xD;
      communication and coping skills. The core of the system was a) a protocol for office-based&#xD;
      patient assessment and follow up, b) an educational/motivational videotape viewed in the&#xD;
      clinical setting, c) scripts and supporting materials for a 4-week minicourse led by a clinic&#xD;
      staff member or volunteer, and d) a package of audiocassettes and supporting printed&#xD;
      materials to facilitate self-directed learning over an extended time period. Printed&#xD;
      materials emphasized the use of cards (hence the acronym 'CARDES') that delivered single&#xD;
      concepts about nutrition or behavior change and that permitted manipulation, selection, and&#xD;
      reorganization of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARDES was developed and evaluated in cooperation with Howard University Hospital in&#xD;
      Washington, D.C. Using a randomized two-group design and a 12-24 month follow up, serum&#xD;
      cholesterol and blood pressure levels of persons counseled with the CARDES program were&#xD;
      compared with values for a control group receiving usual care. Process measures described&#xD;
      adherence outcomes and determinants. Secondary outcomes related to CVD risk factor status&#xD;
      were also evaluated. Prior to the evaluation, a pilot study determined the best sequence for&#xD;
      delivering the information related to dietary change (i.e., Na first, fat/cholesterol first,&#xD;
      or concurrent). Subsequent to the evaluation and prior to development of the final system and&#xD;
      dissemination plan, an assessment was made of the potential utility of CARDES with other&#xD;
      black populations with low literacy skills.&#xD;
