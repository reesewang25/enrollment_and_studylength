  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a prospective, longitudinal, analysis of the psychophysiological effects of&#xD;
      chronic exposure to environmental stress. The study took advantage of a unique, naturally&#xD;
      occurring experiment caused by the relocation of a major international airport.&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies were conducted on blood pressure and the neuroendocrine effects of noise resulting&#xD;
      from the relocation of the Munich International Airport. At the former airport site the&#xD;
      investigators monitored people exposed to high levels of noise and then tracked these same&#xD;
      individuals as their ambient environment became normal following the shutdown of the airport.&#xD;
      At the new airport site, the opposite situation occurred: Individuals living in normal, quiet&#xD;
      ambient conditions became exposed to loud aircraft noise. At both sites, control groups were&#xD;
      formed who were not exposed to aircraft noise. The study piggybacked onto a German sponsored&#xD;
      grant. NIH funds covered the costs of cardiovascular and psycho-physiological data analysis.&#xD;
      Measures included biochemical assays of chronic neuroendocrine markers of stress, resting&#xD;
      blood pressure, and reactivity of blood pressure during cognitive tasks. Perceptions of&#xD;
      community noise levels were also assessed as possible mediators of the stressful effects of&#xD;
      chronic exposure to ambient, environmental noise.&#xD;
