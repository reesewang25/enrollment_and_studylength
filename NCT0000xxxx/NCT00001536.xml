  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the gene responsible for achondroplasia was identified in 1994, it has become possible&#xD;
      to test for achondroplasia prenatally. Moreover, prenatal genetic testing for achondroplasia&#xD;
      is relatively simple and is highly likely to be informative for any couple seeking testing.&#xD;
      Four diagnostic laboratories in the U.S. are currently performing prenatal genetic testing&#xD;
      for achondroplasia. Before prenatal genetic testing for achondroplasia becomes more widely&#xD;
      available, however, it is essential that we learn more about the lives of affected&#xD;
      individuals and their families, the implications of offering testing for achondroplasia, and&#xD;
      the education and the counseling needs of this community. Personal interviews and stories&#xD;
      have been published and discussed at national meetings (Ablon 1984). We conducted a pilot&#xD;
      telephone interview survey of 15 individuals with achondroplasia. What is needed now is a&#xD;
      large scale quantitative study of the community of little people and their families. To meet&#xD;
      this need, we have developed a survey tool to analyze family relationships, quality of life,&#xD;
      tendencies toward optimism or pessimism, information-avoiding or information-seeking&#xD;
      behaviors, social support, involvement in Little People of America Inc. (LPA), self-esteem,&#xD;
      sociodemographics and views on achondroplasia, religiousness, reproductive and family plans,&#xD;
      genetic testing, and abortion. The self-administered survey will be completed nationally by a&#xD;
      sample of persons with achondroplasia and their family members.&#xD;
