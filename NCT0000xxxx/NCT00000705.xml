  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving azidothymidine (AZT) to HIV-positive patients&#xD;
      with hemophilia is safe and if it is effective in lowering HIV levels and boosting the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infects and inactivates certain blood cells that are part of the body's immune system.&#xD;
      The damage to the body's immune system can result in unusual infections and/or unusual forms&#xD;
      of cancer. A large percentage of hemophiliacs are HIV-positive and there is a clear risk for&#xD;
      the development of AIDS in these patients. AZT may be effective in lowering HIV levels and&#xD;
      boosting the immune system but its side effects are not understood in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a clear risk for development of AIDS in hemophilic patients. AZT administration has&#xD;
      been shown to inhibit HIV replication in vitro. Patients taking AZT have experienced fewer&#xD;
      opportunistic infections and improvements in measures of immunity. The most common laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities observed with AZT are hematologic. However, the clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      toxicity of AZT remains poorly understood in hemophiliacs. Hepatitis and liver dysfunction&#xD;
      are more common in this population compared to other groups at risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
      Because AZT is largely metabolized in the liver, drug pharmacokinetics needs to be evaluated&#xD;
      in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both hemophiliacs and non-hemophiliacs take AZT for a period of 12 weeks. The first dose is&#xD;
      administered intravenously. AZT is then given orally every 4 hours while awake (5 doses per&#xD;
      day). Patients are evaluated by physical examinations and laboratory assessments. These&#xD;
      include HIV culture of blood and leukocyte counts, lymphocyte counts, and lymphocyte subsets&#xD;
      measured at study entry and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients are hospitalized for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies at study entry and at Weeks 6 and 12. Each of these studies involves&#xD;
      both intravenous and oral administration within 48 hours of one another. Blood is sampled at&#xD;
      0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after each administration and urine is collected&#xD;
      every 2 hours for 12 hours.&#xD;
