      To compare the effects of three levels of dietary sodium and two patterns of diet (a control&#xD;
      diet and an intervention diet high in fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy products and low&#xD;
      in fat) on blood pressure in individuals with higher than optimal blood pressure or with&#xD;
      Stage 1 hypertension.. DASH - Sodium built on and extended the results of the NHLBI-initiated&#xD;
      Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive&#xD;
      medication, affects 24 percent of the United States adult population or about 50 million&#xD;
      people. Because the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke increases with increasing blood&#xD;
      pressure throughout the entire range of blood pressure levels, people with blood pressure&#xD;
      above the optimal level of 120/80 are at increased risk of disease. Approximately 48 percent&#xD;
      of the adult population have blood pressure either normal but above optimal levels or have&#xD;
      Stage 1 hypertension, a prevalence which increases with age. To combat this highly prevalent&#xD;
      condition, primary prevention through lifestyle modification represents a highly promising&#xD;
      strategy for public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DASH - Sodium extended research from DASH trial to address several issues of relevance to&#xD;
      clinical practice and public health and capitalized on the success of DASH by following the&#xD;
      multicenter outpatient feeding study model. The model permitted a true test of efficacy&#xD;
      because of high adherence and follow-up rates. In addition, the population studied across&#xD;
      four geographic areas, encompassing individuals with diastolic blood pressure between 80-95&#xD;
      mm Hg and systolic blood pressure &lt;160 mm Hg, was broadly representative, thus making the&#xD;
      results generalizable to a large portion of the United States population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects on blood pressure of three levels of sodium intake and two dietary patterns were&#xD;
      compared. The combined impact of sodium reduction with dietary intervention was evaluated as&#xD;
      a potential non-pharmacologic treatment alternative to drug therapy for stage one&#xD;
      hypertension or for maintaining normal blood pressure levels. The two dietary patterns were a&#xD;
      control diet that represented the typical American diet and an intervention diet (DASH diet)&#xD;
      that was high in fruits, vegetables, included whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, and&#xD;
      reduced in fats, red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages and dairy products. The&#xD;
      three levels of sodium were higher (current United States intake), intermediate (current&#xD;
      recommended levels), and lower (potentially optimal levels). Participants were assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two dietary patterns using a parallel group design and were fed at each sodium&#xD;
      level using a randomized cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three eligibility pre-screening visits were followed by a two-week run-in feeding period and&#xD;
      then a four-week intervention period at each of three sodium levels. During the run-in for&#xD;
      the intervention feeding periods, all food was provided to participants. They were required&#xD;
      to attend the clinic for at least one meal per day, five days per week, and to take home food&#xD;
      to eat for other meals. Each of the four clinics recruited 100 participants. Blood pressure&#xD;
      was measured once a week during the first of three weeks and five times during the last week.&#xD;
      During the final feeding period, fasting blood was collected and 24-hour urine collections&#xD;
      were analyzed for magnesium, potassium. calcium, sodium, and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DASH - Sodium determined, separately by race, gender, and hypertension status: 1) the effects&#xD;
      on blood pressure of three levels of dietary sodium within the context of both a control diet&#xD;
      and the DASH diet; 2) the effect on blood pressure of the DASH diet, relative to the control&#xD;
      diet, at each of the three levels of sodium intake. The study also assessed whether the&#xD;
      effect on blood pressure of going from higher to lower sodium diets differs for participants&#xD;
      in the control and DASH diets. Lastly, the study determined whether the blood pressure effect&#xD;
      associated with reducing sodium from the higher to the intermediate level differs from the&#xD;
      blood pressure effect associated with reducing sodium from the intermediate to the lower&#xD;
      level, that is, testing whether the blood pressure effects of sodium are linear across sodium&#xD;
      levels for each diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and screening began in August 1997. The first cohort began the experimental diets&#xD;
      in January 1998 and the last cohort completed the diets in November 1999. A total of 412&#xD;
      participants were enrolled into the study. Results were presented at the annual meeting of&#xD;
      American Society of Hypertension in May 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was renewed under R01HL57114 to to analyze the data of the trial The hypothesis to&#xD;
      be tested is that genetic makeup modulates the BP effects of DASH diet and reduced sodium&#xD;
      intake through one or more of the following mechanisms: 1) effects on vascular tone; 2)&#xD;
      effects on mineralocorticoid regulation of sodium homeostasis; and 3) effects on&#xD;
      non-classical regulation of sodium homeostasis.&#xD;
