  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. The disease&#xD;
      can be serious and even fatal. Approximately 25% of patients with chronic hepatitis C will&#xD;
      develop cirrhosis and some of these patients will develop cancer of the liver or liver&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently the disease is treated with a combination of alpha interferon or peginterferon&#xD;
      (antiviral and immune stimulating drugs) and ribavirin (an antiviral drug). Alpha interferon&#xD;
      is given by injection three times a week whereas peginterferon is given by injection only&#xD;
      once a week. Ribavirin is given as a tablet by mouth twice a day. The combination therapy is&#xD;
      given for 6 to months. About half of the patients given these medications will receive a&#xD;
      lasting benefit and many patients do not respond well to the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will select up to 50 patients will chronic hepatitis C who have not responded to&#xD;
      combination therapy or who could not stand the side effects associated with interferon or&#xD;
      peginterferon therapy. These subjects will be evaluated and undergo liver biopsy to determine&#xD;
      their present liver condition. If selected as subjects they will be started on single drug&#xD;
      therapy with ribavirin. The drug will be given orally twice a day at a dose based on the&#xD;
      patient's body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed on an out-patient basis. They will we asked to return for&#xD;
      regular check-ups and blood tests every 2 to 8 weeks for the duration of the study. After 6&#xD;
      months, the medication will be stopped or adjusted based on the results of the subject's&#xD;
      blood tests (liver enzymes). A response is considered if a decrease of 50% or more of the&#xD;
      initial liver enzyme (alanine aminotransferase, ALT) is noted. A complete response will be&#xD;
      considered if liver enzymes return to normal levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy will be discontinued after 6 months if patients do not respond. However, patients&#xD;
      that respond to the single drug therapy will continue to receive the medication at a&#xD;
      decreased dose. The patients will remain on an appropriate dose for up to 8 years with repeat&#xD;
      liver biopsies at 2, 4 and 8 years to assess progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if long-term therapy with ribavirin is safe and effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50 patients with chronic hepatitis C will be treated for up to eight years with&#xD;
      ribavirin, an orally administered antiviral agent. Patients will be chosen who have moderate&#xD;
      to severe chronic hepatitis C who previously failed to have a sustained virological response&#xD;
      to the combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin or who were intolerant to interferon&#xD;
      therapy or who have significant contraindications to the use of interferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After medical evaluation and liver biopsy, patients will begin receiving ribavirin in a dose&#xD;
      of 1000 mg (body weight less than 75 K) or 1200 mg daily (two or three capsules of 200 mg&#xD;
      twice daily by mouth). Patients will be followed on therapy with visits to the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic for medical interview, physical examinations and blood tests at 2 to 8 week intervals.&#xD;
      After six months, the dose of ribavirin will be stopped or adjusted based upon changes in&#xD;
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels comparing the average of the three values from month 2,&#xD;
      4, and 6 to the baseline levels. A decrease by 50% or more will be considered a partial&#xD;
      biomedical response and a decrease to within the normal range will be considered a complete&#xD;
      biochemical response. In patients who do not respond by six months, therapy will be stopped,&#xD;
      whereas, in patients who respond, therapy will be continued decreasing the dose in increments&#xD;
      of 200 mg per day every 6 months as long as a biochemical response is maintained. The minimal&#xD;
      dose will be 400 mg per day. In patients with a response, therapy will be continued for up to&#xD;
      8 years with repeat liver biopsies and evaluations at 2, 4 and 8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary criterion for success of therapy will be the degree of histologic improvement on&#xD;
      liver biopsy at 2, 4 and 8 years; supportive, secondary criteria will be improvements in ALT&#xD;
      levels and in symptoms done at the same time points. This open-label pilot study will allow&#xD;
      for therapy of patients with resistant forms of chronic hepatitis C and will address whether&#xD;
      long-term therapy with this agent is safe, as well as whether prolonged monotherapy with&#xD;
      ribavirin leads to sustained improvements in serum ALT levels, whether these can be&#xD;
      maintained using lower doses of ribavirin, and whether the improvements reflect amelioration&#xD;
      of the underlying liver disease as judged histologically.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Elevated alanine (ALT) or asparate (AST) aminotransferase activities averaging at least&#xD;
        twice the upper limit of normal on three determinations taken at least one month apart&#xD;
        during the previous 6 months. The mean of these three determinations will be defined as&#xD;
        &quot;baseline&quot; ALT and AST levels.&#xD;

        histology activity index of at least 6 (out of a maximum of 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindications to the use of alpha interferon, either in the form of specific&#xD;
        contraindications to its use (depression, psychiatric illness, neurological impairment,&#xD;
        severe thrombocytopenia, autoimmune disease), or the history of severe side effects or&#xD;
        intolerance during a previous course of alpha interferon, or lack of a sustained&#xD;
        virological (sustained lost of HCV RNA from serum for more than six months after stopping&#xD;
        treatment) response to an adequate course (6 months) of the combination of alpha interferon&#xD;
        and ribavirin or (after September 1, 2003) the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS IN 98-DK-0003:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An important group of patients who were enrolled in the current study, were patients who&#xD;
        participated in the Clinical Research Protocol 98-DK-0003 (Combination of alpha interferon&#xD;
        with long-term ribavirin for patients with chronic hepatitis C) and who did not have a&#xD;
        sustained virological response to this treatment. These patients were eligible to enroll&#xD;
        into the current study once they had finished the therapy and follow up period in that&#xD;
        trial. These patients fit the inclusion criteria listed above with one exception: some&#xD;
        patients were receiving ribavirin monotherapy as a part of their participation in&#xD;
        98-DK-0003. These patients were eligible to be immediately enrolled into this study without&#xD;
        a medication-free period in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregancy or, in women of childbearing potential, inability to practice adequate&#xD;
        contraception. Men with spouses or sexual partners of childbearing potential also be&#xD;
        excluded if they are unable to practice adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant systemic illnesses other than liver disease, including a history of congestive&#xD;
        heart failure, cerebral vascular disease, renal failure (creatinine clearance less than 50&#xD;
        ml/min), and angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with an abnormal stress test or carotid untrasound will not be enrolled into this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pre-existing anemia (hematocrit less than 32%) or known history of hemolytic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Interferon or immunosuppressive therapy within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of another form of liver disease in addition to viral hepatitis, such as&#xD;
        autoimmune or alcoholic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active or recent (within one year) alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness that is&#xD;
        likely to interfere with compliance and requirements for safety monitoring during this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
