  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the role of prostaglandins-a&#xD;
      type of fatty acid with hormone-like actions-in the regulation of brain blood flow. The&#xD;
      results will provide information on how to better use this technique to study brain function,&#xD;
      which, in turn, may lead to a better understanding of certain illnesses and more effective&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants will fill out a health questionnaire and undergo a history, physical examination&#xD;
      and MRI studies. MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
      instead of X-rays to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scanning,&#xD;
      the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. An intercom&#xD;
      system allows the subject to speak with the staff member performing the study at all times&#xD;
      during the procedure. Four separate studies will be done-two carbon dioxide inhalation&#xD;
      studies and two functional activation studies-as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon dioxide inhalation (indomethacin): This study is done in two parts. In both parts, an&#xD;
      MRI brain scan is done. During the scan, the subject inhales an air mixture containing 6%&#xD;
      carbon dioxide through a facemask or mouthpiece. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored&#xD;
      during inhalation of the mixture. For the second part of the study, indomethacin-a&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-is injected through a catheter (thin flexible tube) in&#xD;
      an arm vein. Indomethacin inhibits prostaglandin production. Total scan time averages between&#xD;
      45 and 90 minutes, with a maximum of 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon dioxide inhalation (rofecoxib and celecoxib): This study is identical to the one&#xD;
      above, except either rofecoxib or celecoxib is given instead of indomethacin. Both of these&#xD;
      drugs are also non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit prostaglandin production.&#xD;
      Unlike indomethacin, rofecoxib and celecoxib are given orally instead of through a vein, so,&#xD;
      to allow time for the drug to be absorbed, the second scan is delayed for 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional activation (indomethacin): This study is done in two parts. In both parts, a MRI&#xD;
      brain scan is done. During the study, the subject performs a simple motor task, such as&#xD;
      finger tapping. For the second part of the study, indomethacin is injected through a catheter&#xD;
      in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional activation (rofecoxib and celecoxib): This study is identical to the indomethacin&#xD;
      functional activation study, except either rofecoxib or celecoxib is given instead of&#xD;
      indomethacin. Because they are given orally instead of through a vein, the second scan is&#xD;
      delayed 2 hours to allow time for the drug to be absorbed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advances in MR perfusion imaging have provided clinical researchers with the opportunity to&#xD;
      quantify regional increases in cerebral blood flow. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate in humans the role of prostaglandins in the regulation of cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      during hypercapnia and functional activation. For this investigation the increase in cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow associated with either hypercapnia or functional activation will be measured&#xD;
      before and after the administration of pharmacological agents that inhibit the production of&#xD;
      prostaglandins. In the hypercapnia study cerebral blood flow will be increased by inhalation&#xD;
      of an air mixture containing 6% CO2. For the functional activation study cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      will be increased by a sensory motor task.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any healthy normal volunteer above the age of 18 who is capable of giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded for the following reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They have contraindications to MR scanning, such as the following: aneurysm clip, implanted&#xD;
        neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker or autodefibrillator, cochlear implant,&#xD;
        ocular foreign body (e.g., metal shavings), or insulin pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They have panic disorder or migraine (because of possible complications with CO2&#xD;
        inhalation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        They have cirrhosis, any renal dysfunction, or a chronic respiratory illness (such as&#xD;
        asthma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        They have allergies to sulfonamide drugs or cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (NSAIDS).&#xD;
