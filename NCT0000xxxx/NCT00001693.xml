    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I/II multi-center trial, of the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Celecoxib in a cohort of 81 HNPCC subjects and gene carriers. The three proposed&#xD;
      intervention arms are: Celecoxib (to be provided by Searle) will be administered at 200mg&#xD;
      p.o. BID x 12 months or 400mg p.o. BID x 12 months vs. Placebo p.o. BID x 12 months.&#xD;
      Assessment of endoscopic and tissue-based biomarker endpoints will be conducted at baseline&#xD;
      and 12 months on study drug or placebo. Patients that present with polyps at baseline will&#xD;
      undergo a month 4 endoscopy. Plasma drug trough samples for pharmacokinetic analyses will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and month 12. NCI-Chemoprevention Branch will coordinate the efforts&#xD;
      and activities of all sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring will occur via in-patient interviews with exams at month twelve; symptom&#xD;
      questionnaires completed at baseline, months one, four, eight and twelve; blood and&#xD;
      urinalysis at baseline and at months one, four, eight and twelve. A post-administration&#xD;
      telephone call to evaluate side effect resolution will occur at months 13-14 for patients who&#xD;
      have unresolved adverse events at the end of month 12.&#xD;

        Diagnosis of HNPCC patient or HNPCC carrier status defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HNPCC patient is an individual with a personal history of RER plus HNPCC related malignancy&#xD;
        AND; meets the Amsterdam criteria or modified Amsterdam criteria (an HNPCC associated&#xD;
        extracolonic cancer may be substituted for one of the three colorectal cases in one family&#xD;
        otherwise required by these criteria) OR; having a definite mutation of one of the HNPCC -&#xD;
        related genes identified by gene sequencing or other method of reliability. This includes&#xD;
        gene status determined through segregation analysis in cases in which &quot;direct&quot; testing&#xD;
        yields no alteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HNPCC carrier is a relative of an individual meeting the criteria of an &quot;HNPCC patient&quot; as&#xD;
        described above and having a mutation of one of the HNPCC-related genes identified by gene&#xD;
        sequencing or other method of equivalent reliability (this includes gene status determined&#xD;
        through segregation analysis in cases in which direct testing yields no alterations, as&#xD;
        above) OR; having an RER plus adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Voluntary consent documented by a signed and witnessed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to abstain from use of NSAID's (including aspirin), oral adrenocorticosteroids,&#xD;
        and other nonsterodial OTC products for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If patient is female and of childbearing potential, she must meet all of the following&#xD;
        conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have been using adequate contraception (e.g., abstinence, condom, IUD, birth control pill,&#xD;
        diaphragm and spermicide gel combination) since her last menses AND;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be willing to use adequate contraception (as above) during the study AND;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not be breastfeeding AND;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Though an individual with prior colorectal surgery is allowed, the subject must have&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 50 percent of the colorectum with documentation describing the&#xD;
        post-surgical anatomy (e.g., operative report).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No use of investigational agent within the last 3 months, or at the discretion of the&#xD;
        medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject will be allowed to proceed to baseline colonoscopy so long as all of the&#xD;
        following laboratory criteria are met on baseline evaluation: Hgb greater than 10.0 gm/dl,&#xD;
        platelet count greater than 100,000/ul; WBC greater than 3,000/ul; ALT less than 1.5 x&#xD;
        upper limit of normal; AST less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase less&#xD;
        than 1.5 x upper limit of normal, total bilirubin less than 1.2 x upper limit of normal,&#xD;
        creatinine less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal, negative pregnancy test. For tests not&#xD;
        mentioned specifically, there must be no clinically significant abnormalities which in the&#xD;
        opinion of the PI would preclude a subject's safe participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To proceed to randomization, the subject must have all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An assessable colon or colonic segment (greater than or equal to 50 percent) which was&#xD;
        endoscopically evaluated in its entirety following an adequate preparative procedure AND;&#xD;
&#xD;
        An assessment of aberrant crypt foci via &quot;enhanced&quot; endoscopy 10 cm distal to the ileocecal&#xD;
        valve or 10 cm distal to the anastamosis and at the distal most 10 cm from the rectum AND;&#xD;
&#xD;
        All polyps must have been removed with the exception of small polyps (less than or equal to&#xD;
        0.6 cm in maximal diameter) amenable to serial endoscopic surveillance AND;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mucosal sampling via pinch biopsies must have been obtained from normal-appearing mucosa in&#xD;
        standardized areas of the right and left colon (or surrogate regions in the case of prior&#xD;
        surgical resections) and from any areas that are clearly neoplastic or suspicious for&#xD;
        neoplastic pathologies (ACF, adenomas, carcinomas) of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No anticipated colectomy within eighteen months of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of hypersensitivity to COX-2 inhibitors, sulfonamides, NSAID's or salicylates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No use of NSAID's (including aspirin) or oral adrenocorticosteroids, at any dose at a&#xD;
        frequency averaging greater than 3 times per week during the six months prior to study&#xD;
        entry. Use of such NSAID's or oral adrenocorticosteroids at the above frequency will&#xD;
        require a six-month washout period prior to eligibility, beginning with the time of the&#xD;
        patient's last dose. Use of any dose of NSAID's or oral adrenocorticosteroids, at an&#xD;
        average frequency of 1-3 times per week during the six months prior to study entry will&#xD;
        require a three-month washout period beginning with the time of last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history in the past year of discrete gastric or duodenal ulcer of size greater than 5&#xD;
        mm, except that patients with a history of Helicobacter pylori-related peptic ulcer disease&#xD;
        may become eligible for study upon successfully completing antibiotic treatment of&#xD;
        Helicobacter pylori.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to participate in the scheduled follow-up tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No significant medical or psychiatric problems which would make the patient a poor protocol&#xD;
        candidate, in the opinion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No &quot;unacceptable clinical risk&quot; to proceed (based upon the subclinical discoveries made via&#xD;
        baseline colonoscopy and biopsies) including a previously-unknown bleeding diathesis, a new&#xD;
        diagnosis of carcinoma, suspicion that the subject may require colectomy (complete or&#xD;
        partial) within eighteen months of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must not have undergone a colectomy within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must not have undergone chemotherapy within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must not have received pelvic radiation.&#xD;
