  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study of children and adolescents (current N=100) with very early onset by age 12 (COS) of&#xD;
      DSM-III-R defined schizophrenia with (97-M-0126) is examining the clinical, neurobiological,&#xD;
      early neurodevelopmental, genetic, and clinical drug response characteristics of these cases.&#xD;
      Earlier studies have documented the continuity between COS and adult onset cases (See&#xD;
      Jacobsen and Rapoport, 1998 for review). The focus has now shifted to increasing the sample&#xD;
      size and evaluation of familial risk factors including: psychiatric diagnoses of family&#xD;
      members; smooth pursuit eye movements; neuropsychological tests deficits, and obtaining blood&#xD;
      for cell lines for genetic studies (family members only, this is also covered under&#xD;
      96-M-0060, Dr. Ellen Sidransky).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of obstetrical records of COS probands indicated no increase in adverse pre or&#xD;
      perinatal events for these cases compared with obstetrical records of their siblings&#xD;
      (Nicolson et al submitted). In contrast, several findings point to increased risk for these&#xD;
      probands. To date, a total of 5 (10.4%) COS subjects were found to have previously unknown&#xD;
      cytogenetic abnormalities (Microdeletion of 22q11 (3 cases), (Usiskin et al, submitted),&#xD;
      Mosaic 45X0 (one case) (Kumra et al, 1998) and balanced 1:7 translocation (Gordon et al&#xD;
      1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of first degree relatives of these very rare cases addresses the hypothesis that&#xD;
      risk factors, most probably genetic, are increased in immediate family members relative both&#xD;
      to community controls and to the relatives of patients with chronic, treatment resistant,&#xD;
      adult-onset schizophrenia (AOS). A second hypothesis is that COS familial risk factors show&#xD;
      significant relationship to the developmental delays/abnormalities being observed in the COS&#xD;
      probands. As a total of 50 additional COS subjects will be studied over the next 5 years, the&#xD;
      pediatric control sample for the probands will also be increased, determined by the need to&#xD;
      have concurrent measures for patients and controls to maintain measurement validity. Thus a&#xD;
      total of 600 additional subjects are to be studied including 50 controls for COS probands,&#xD;
      150 COS relatives, 150 controls for COS relatives, and 250 relatives of adult onset&#xD;
      schizophrenics (AOS).&#xD;

      A study of children and adolescents with very early onset by age 12 (COS) of DSM-III-R&#xD;
      defined schizophrenia is examining the clinical, neurobiological, early neurodevelopmental,&#xD;
      genetic, and clinical drug response characteristics of these cases, under Protocols 97-M-0126&#xD;
      and 03-M-0035. Earlier studies have documented the continuity between COS and adult-onset&#xD;
      cases. The focus has now shifted to increasing the sample size and evaluation of familial&#xD;
      risk factors including: psychiatric diagnoses of family members; neuropsychological testing,&#xD;
      anatomic and functional brain imaging, and obtaining blood and fibroblasts for cell lines for&#xD;
      genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of obstetrical records of COS probands indicated no increase in adverse pre or&#xD;
      perinatal events for these cases compared with obstetrical records of their well siblings. In&#xD;
      contrast, several findings point to increased genetic risk for these probands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of first-degree relatives of these very rare cases addresses the hypothesis that&#xD;
      risk factors, most probably genetic, are increased in immediate family members relative both&#xD;
      to community controls and to the relatives of patients with chronic, treatment resistant,&#xD;
      adult-onset schizophrenia (AOS). A second hypothesis is that COS familial risk factors&#xD;
      include similar forms of the developmental delays/abnormalities being observed in the COS&#xD;
      probands. Preliminary data suggests greater abnormalities of frontal-parietal circuits for&#xD;
      early onset patients and their relatives than seen in adult onset illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine brain development in unrelated healthy volunteers and siblings of our COS&#xD;
      probands by combining resting- and task-related magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging. Imaging studies may lead to greater understanding of&#xD;
      the course, mechanisms, and influences on brain development of high-risk siblings and may&#xD;
      lead to improved understanding of the risk factors, early identification, and optimization of&#xD;
      brain maturation. For more than 20 years, imaging has been done under a separate protocol&#xD;
      (89-M-0006); however, we now plan to incorporate these imaging studies into this protocol (as&#xD;
      well as into our main patient screening and follow-up protocol (03-M-0035) by previously&#xD;
      submitted amendment).&#xD;
