  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in humans of the APL-400-047 vaccine&#xD;
      when administered intramuscularly by needle and syringe at 1 of 3 doses or by Biojector at&#xD;
      the intermediate dose. [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/98: To evaluate the tolerability, safety, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of an increased dose in an additional group of volunteers.] DNA-based&#xD;
      immunization mimics live-attenuated virus vaccination by stimulation of both the humoral and&#xD;
      cellular arms of the immune system; thus, potentially providing the advantages of a live&#xD;
      virus vaccination but without the potential risks. It is essential that novel vaccine&#xD;
      strategies (including DNA-based immunizations) continue to be developed and enter Phase I&#xD;
      human testing because to date, no candidate vaccine from any of the approximately 30 AVEG&#xD;
      Phase I or II trials has progressed to a Phase III efficacy trial. Use of a Biojector jet gun&#xD;
      for vaccine delivery may also have potential psychological, comfort, safety and immunologic&#xD;
      advantages over the traditional needle and syringe method of delivery.&#xD;

      for vaccine delivery may also have potential psychological, comfort, safety and immunologic&#xD;
      advantages over the traditional needle and syringe method of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 volunteers receive four immunizations each (at months 0, 1, 2 and 6) as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 volunteers are enrolled at the 100 microgram dose given intramuscularly (IM) by needle and&#xD;
      syringe. If this dose appears safe and well tolerated through Day 14, 20 more volunteers are&#xD;
      enrolled at the 300 microgram dose; 10 receiving vaccine administered by needle and syringe,&#xD;
      10 receiving vaccine administered by Biojector. If the 300 microgram dose appears safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated through Day 14 in the 10 volunteers who receive intramuscular (IM) injections&#xD;
      with needle and syringe, an additional group of volunteers are enrolled at the 1000 microgram&#xD;
      dose given with needle and syringe. NOTE: Within each group of 10 volunteers, 8 receive&#xD;
      APL-400-047, 2 receive control preparation (bupivacaine carrier alone). [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      07/98: An additional group of 12 volunteers will be treated at a dose of 3000 micrograms&#xD;
      administered by needle and syringe. Ten of these volunteers will receive APL-400-047&#xD;
      formulated with bupivacaine as a facilitating agent; the remaining 2 patients will receive&#xD;
      control preparation (bupivacaine carrier alone).] [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/27/99: Volunteers&#xD;
      previously primed with either 300 or 1000 micrograms of the APL-400-047 vaccine receive an&#xD;
      additional dose of DNA (or control, for control volunteers in the original protocol) followed&#xD;
      one month later by two monthly canarypox (or placebo for control volunteers in the original&#xD;
      protocol) boosts.]&#xD;
