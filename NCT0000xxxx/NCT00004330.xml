      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess whether chronic administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues is safe and&#xD;
      effective for the prevention of cyclic attacks of acute porphyria in women.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: All patients receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue.&#xD;
      Treatment begins on days 1 to 3 of a menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose estrogen begins at approximately 3 months. All patients must have a daily calcium&#xD;
      intake of at least 1 gram; supplements are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for at least 1 year.&#xD;

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Disease Characteristics-- Acute porphyria, i.e.: Acute intermittent porphyria Hereditary&#xD;
        coproporphyria Variegate porphyria Definite cyclic attacks with severe abdominal pain and&#xD;
        other porphyria symptoms during luteal phase of menstrual cycle only Attacks resolve&#xD;
        completely within 5 days of onset of menses, i.e., no symptoms between attacks At least 4&#xD;
        to 6 attacks during the 6 months prior to entry More than half of these attacks must meet&#xD;
        the following criteria: Readily distinguishable from menstrual cramps and premenstrual&#xD;
        syndrome Required hospitalization for narcotic analgesics, phenothiazines, hematin,&#xD;
        intravenous fluids, or other treatment Luteal attacks not requiring hospitalization must be&#xD;
        similar in symptoms and differ only in severity No life-threatening porphyria attacks No&#xD;
        cyclic abdominal pain unless caused by porphyria --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- At least 6&#xD;
        months since ovulation suppression --Patient Characteristics-- Reproductive: Menstrual&#xD;
        cycle 25-35 days for at least 6 months prior to entry Pelvic exam normal within 60 days&#xD;
        prior to entry Pap smear normal, i.e., no dysplasia No amenorrhea No other menstrual&#xD;
        abnormality No other gynecologic abnormality Negative pregnancy test Medically approved&#xD;
        contraception required for 2 months prior to entry and throughout study OR at least 1&#xD;
        menstrual cycle following tubal ligation Other: No allergy to gonadotropin-releasing&#xD;
        hormone analogues No clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results No medical&#xD;
        contraindication to protocol treatment&#xD;
