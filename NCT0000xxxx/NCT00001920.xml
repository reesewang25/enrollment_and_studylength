  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore how the brain works during particular memory tasks in&#xD;
      people with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that patients with schizophrenia have structural and functional&#xD;
      abnormalities in the hippocampus and cerebellum of their brains. These abnormalities are&#xD;
      likely associated with the memory impairment experienced by these patients. Eye blink tests&#xD;
      can provide information about memory acquisition involving the cerebellar and hippocampal&#xD;
      regions. By altering the stimuli interval, these tests can distinguish between&#xD;
      cerebellum-dependent memory associated with subliminal mnemonic encoding and&#xD;
      hippocampus-dependent memory associated with conscious awareness. This study will use&#xD;
      eyeblink tests to determine which type of memory is predominantly affected in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be screened with a physical and psychiatric examination.&#xD;
      Participants will have an electroencephalogram (EEG), an electrocardiogram (ECG), and an&#xD;
      electrodermal test. Evoked potentials and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain&#xD;
      may also be taken.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eyeblink conditioning is a paradigm that allows the study of aspects of the neural mechanism&#xD;
      of memory in humans. This paradigm has been extensively studied in animals and human beings&#xD;
      and its functional neuroanatomy appears to be well understood, involving the hippocampus and&#xD;
      cerebellum. The performance on this task is most likely independent of subject motivation.&#xD;
      Moreover, manipulation of the intervals between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli allows&#xD;
      to study subliminal forms of mnemonic encoding (&quot;delay&quot; task) as well as learning that is&#xD;
      associated with conscious awareness (&quot;trace&quot; task). This makes eyeblink conditioning&#xD;
      particularly suited for study in patient populations, and particularly in schizophrenia where&#xD;
      motivation and attention are frequently confounding factors in the study of memory processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with schizophrenia have been reported to have hippocampal and possibly cerebellar&#xD;
      structural and functional abnormalities, however eyeblink conditioning has been minimally&#xD;
      studied in this patient population. We expect implicit forms of memory (cerebellum dependent)&#xD;
      to be relatively spared as compared to declarative memory (hippocampus dependent) in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to test the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia have deficits in&#xD;
      acquiring the trace form of the task as opposed to the delay, where we assume they would be&#xD;
      unimpaired as compared to normal controls. We would also like to study heart rate and skin&#xD;
      conductance changes that occur during conditioning, since patients with schizophrenia have&#xD;
      showed impaired autonomic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also plan to study neurophysiological correlates of these behaviors with evoked response&#xD;
      potentials (EP) and eventually functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect EPs to show significant change in relation to development of the behavioral&#xD;
      response. The association of awareness of the stimulus contingency with slow cortical&#xD;
      potentials on the EEG will also be of interest.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No psychiatric or severe chronic medical illness at the time of the study, and by history.&#xD;
        This includes the absence of substance abuse histories, learning disabilities and all DSM&#xD;
        IV disorders. Medical histories will be evaluated by the investigators and medical&#xD;
        conditions that are judged not to interfere with the study may be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No use of psychotropic substances in the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 18-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No family history of schizophrenia by subject report and possibly also by collateral report&#xD;
        by at least one other family member.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Schizophrenia, any subtype or schizoaffective disorder, depressed type by DSM IV (110).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only concomitant medications should be neuroleptics and medications directed at controlling&#xD;
        side effects (e.g. anticholinergics). An effort will be made to recruit patients on&#xD;
        atypical neuroleptics, therefore attempting to minimize the anticholinergics, which might&#xD;
        interfere with the acquisition of a conditioned response. When patients on anticholinergic&#xD;
        treatment will be recruited as inpatients, a clinical evaluation of the risks and benefits&#xD;
        of suspending anticholinergic treatment will be made and discussed with the patient.&#xD;
        Anticholinergics will be withdrawn for a period equivalent to 3 half lives of the drug&#xD;
        before attempting the study, if this is judged to be achievable with a relatively low risk&#xD;
        and the patient agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age18-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls and Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Impaired hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of caffeine or tobacco in the 2 hours preceding the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Head trauma with loss of consciousness in the last year, or any evidence of functional&#xD;
        impairment due to and persisting after head trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects who are unable to withstand the eyeblink testing will be excluded. Subjects&#xD;
        who are not able to participate in the MRI (e.g. due to claustrophobia) will be studied to&#xD;
        achieve a larger group for the behavioral experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are found to have eye lesions on exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or healthy volunteers with a known risk from exposure to high magnetic fields&#xD;
        (e.g. patients with pace makers) and those who have metallic implants (e.g. braces) in the&#xD;
        head region (likely to create artifact on the MRI scans) will be excluded from&#xD;
        participating in the MRI studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Coexistence of another major mental illness at the time of the study. If the patients&#xD;
        experienced other mental illnesses in the past (e.g. a learning disability or major&#xD;
        depression), then this should be judged to be fully recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for substance abuse met in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for substance dependence met in the last year. If criteria for dependence were met&#xD;
        in the past, then the duration of the disorder was less than 3 years, or not judged to have&#xD;
        produced long term brain changes to allow the patient to be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Major concurrent medical illness likely to interfere with the acquisition of the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concomitant medications which could interfere with performance on the task, excluding&#xD;
        neuroleptics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of diskinetic movements of the face and tongue (likely to interfere with eyeblink&#xD;
        measures, or of gross involuntary movements of the whole body (likely to interfere with&#xD;
        positioning in the MRI scanner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy testing will be performed on women of childbearing age within the three days&#xD;
        prior to MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Siblings of Patients with Schizophrenia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The same inclusion criteria as normal volunteers, with the exception of family history, of&#xD;
        course. In addition, the inclusion criteria for protocol #95-M-0150 will apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The same exclusion criteria as normal volunteers will apply.&#xD;
