  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine and compare the health-related quality of life and degree of symptom&#xD;
      discomfort in two groups of patients receiving intensive drug therapy for HIV infection. One&#xD;
      group will receive continuous treatment over the entire 88-week study period; the other will&#xD;
      have interruptions in therapy over the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's trial,&#xD;
      &quot;Immunologic and Virologic Studies of Intermittent versus Continuous HAART [highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy] in the Treatment of HIV Disease,&quot; may participate in this study. At&#xD;
      periodic intervals for a total of 7 times during the 88-week trial, this companion study will&#xD;
      require participants in both the interrupted and the continuous therapy groups to complete&#xD;
      the following two questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MOS-HIV Health Survey - The patient provides a self-assessment of his or her physical&#xD;
           and emotional well being. Survey questions are related to the ability to perform work&#xD;
           and daily living activities, mood and state of mind, limitations on social activities,&#xD;
           ability to concentrate, energy level, pain level, general quality of life, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptom Distress Scale - The patient rates the degree of symptom distress by ranking&#xD;
           from 1 to 5 his or her agreement with statements about various physical and emotional&#xD;
           factors, including appetite, nausea, breathing, cough, pain, insomnia, fatigue, bowel&#xD;
           problems, concentration, appearance, and outlook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the impact of HIV treatments on health-related quality of life and symptom&#xD;
      distress may provide information helpful in evaluating new treatment approaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of multi-drug regimens known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV&#xD;
      infection can now be considered a chronic, manageable disease for many people in the United&#xD;
      States. However, these therapies come with complex medication administration regimens and&#xD;
      numerous side effects and distressing symptoms, which may impact significantly on a person's&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the HR-QOL&#xD;
      and symptom distress (the degree of discomfort from specific symptoms) in individuals&#xD;
      participating in the NIAID protocol, &quot;Immunologic and virologic studies of intermittent&#xD;
      versus continuous HAART in the treatment of HIV disease&quot;. In that study thirty-five subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive continuous HAART therapy and 35 subjects will receive&#xD;
      interrupted therapy. In this, a companion study, HR-QOL and symptom distress will be measured&#xD;
      at seven time points during the 88 weeks of the protocol. Data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      repeated measures and multivariate statistical tests.&#xD;
