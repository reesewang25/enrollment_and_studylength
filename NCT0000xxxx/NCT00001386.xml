      Synthetic HIV Peptide Vaccines (Treatment Protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are conducting a study to evaluate the safety of two peptide vaccines (given alone or in&#xD;
      combination) in patients with early HIV infection. Patients entered onto the study must have&#xD;
      &gt;500 CD4 cells/mm(3) and have preserved cardiac, hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function.&#xD;
      Patients must be off all anti-retroviral therapy for at least 6 months and may not have&#xD;
      received any experimental HIV vaccines. The vaccines being testing in this trial are&#xD;
      comprised of short peptide segments of the HIV envelope, including the V3 loop. In animal&#xD;
      studies, the peptides were able to induce neutralizing antibodies as well as cytotoxic T&#xD;
      responses to HIV. This will be the first trial in which they are given to humans. The study&#xD;
      will last for approximately one year, during which time the volunteers will receive 6 peptide&#xD;
      vaccines under the skin. For more information, please call Tino Merced-Galindez, R.N. at&#xD;
      (301) 496-8959 or Dr. Richard Little at (800) 772-5464.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients who are seropositive, documented by a licensed ELISA with a confirmatory Western&#xD;
        blot assay for HIV with greater than or equal to 500 CD4+ cells/mm(3) at the time of&#xD;
        screening who also meet either of the 2 following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        During acute infection there is no lower limit for the CD4 count (acute infection is&#xD;
        defined for this protocol as the 6 month period after diagnosis of HIV seropositivity in a&#xD;
        patient with documented negative HIV serology within the 6 months prior to diagnosis of HIV&#xD;
        seropositivity) OR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        If there is a history of CD4 count less than 300 cells/mm(s) at any point after initial HIV&#xD;
        seropositive diagnosis patient will not be eligible, unless this count was during the time&#xD;
        of acute infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ambulatory status, and ability and willingness to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be over 18 years old and have an estimated life expectancy of more than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hgb greater than or equal to 12 g/dl for men and 11 gm/dl for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ANC greater than or equal to 1000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance greater than 50&#xD;
        ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        LFT: AST and ALT less than or equal to 3x upper limit of normal IU/ml for enrollment.&#xD;
        Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bilirubin within normal limits, except for known Gilbert's Syndrome or if patient is on&#xD;
        protease inhibitor therapy. For patients on protease inhibitor therapy, direct bilirubin&#xD;
        less than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl and indirect bilirubin less than or equal to 4.5 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to comply with a medical regimen of highly active antiretroviral&#xD;
        therapy, and must be on a stable antiretroviral regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
        the first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not be receiving antiretroviral therapy or should not have received&#xD;
        antiretroviral therapy within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients without actual or suspected allergies to any component of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior vaccines for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not have received treatment with the following meds at study entry or&#xD;
        within preceding 3 months - agents with immunomodulating activity, parenteral therapies,&#xD;
        HIV drugs, vaccines, interferons, corticosteroids, any growth factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior Aids defining OI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No active life threatening infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No severe malabsorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No evidence of Kaposi Sarcoma or other tumor - likely to require cytotoxic antitumor&#xD;
        therapy within 6 months of entering study. Must complete acute therapy for infections at&#xD;
        least 14 days prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No pregnancy. Female patients of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy&#xD;
        test prior to vaccine administration. Males and females must agree to use effective birth&#xD;
        control methods during the course of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients in whom there is a medical contraindication or potential problems in complying&#xD;
        with the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
