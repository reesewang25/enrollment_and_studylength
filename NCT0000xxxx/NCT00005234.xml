      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies of Black-white differences in hypertension and coronary disease have compared&#xD;
      racial groups from markedly different socioeconomic and educational backgrounds. This study&#xD;
      represented one of a few, if any, long term prospective studies of cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      middle-class Blacks and whites of similar education and occupation, in whom both youthful and&#xD;
      midlife risk factors were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, the prevalence and incidence of coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases were compared using standardized endpoint&#xD;
      criteria. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in midlife were compared between&#xD;
      cohorts, and included smoking, diabetes, family history, dietary factors, and lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol levels. The youthful predictors of midlife cardiovascular risk factors were&#xD;
      determined using baseline data collected by identical protocols in the two cohorts between&#xD;
      1957 and 1965. The youthful risk factors were related to the incidence of disease in midlife&#xD;
      in two cohorts to identify differences in significance, independence, and relative importance&#xD;
      of risk factors in Blacks versus whites.&#xD;
