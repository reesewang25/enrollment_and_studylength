      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in older persons in the United&#xD;
      States. Nearly two-thirds of all deaths in men and women 65 years of age or older are due to&#xD;
      some manifestation of cardiovascular disease. Further, cardiovascular disease is a major&#xD;
      cause of disability in the elderly. Although there is relatively extensive epidemiologic data&#xD;
      on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in younger individuals, particularly younger men,&#xD;
      in 1986 when the study was initiated, relatively little information existed on the prevalence&#xD;
      and antecedents of cardiovascular disease in men and women over 65 years of age. Further, the&#xD;
      data that did exist tended to be contradictory. From a public health perspective, it was&#xD;
      important to identify risk factors for cardiovascular disease in older individuals for&#xD;
      several reasons. The numbers and proportion of elderly persons in the U.S. were growing, and&#xD;
      would continue to grow well into the next century. This segment of our society, which&#xD;
      comprised 12 percent of the population in 1986, accounted for one third of our health care&#xD;
      costs. Older Americans will continue to make significant demands on the health care system in&#xD;
      the coming decades. The identification of risk factors for this major public health problem&#xD;
      (e.g., cardiovascular disease) may lead to interventions which would improve the health of&#xD;
      older Americans and thus benefit the entire society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for this project have been gathered since 1975 by the Dunedin Program, a&#xD;
      population-based geriatric health-screening program. This Program was designed to screen&#xD;
      persons 65 years of age or older for a wide variety of medical disorders. It was situated in&#xD;
      Dunedin, Florida, which is on the mid-west Gulf coast. Each participant was seen at the&#xD;
      clinic once a year. The clinic visit consisted of registration, a physical examination, and&#xD;
      questionnaire/medication form. Data were available on family history of illnesses, illnesses&#xD;
      of participant, smoking history, alcohol use, emotional status, coffee consumption, dietary&#xD;
      habits, current symptoms, social activities, exercise, attitudes towards health care, height,&#xD;
      weight, blood pressure, carotid artery auscultation, electrocardiogram, lipid levels, blood&#xD;
      chemistries and blood counts, diabetes, urine samples, and medication use. In 1986, a total&#xD;
      of 5,085 persons had completed the first screening examination and 1,540 had completed a full&#xD;
      eight years of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase, follow-up time for each participant was computed and changes in risk&#xD;
      factor status analyzed. Cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality rates were calculated.&#xD;
      In the second phase, incidence rates of cardiovascular disease were computed by category of&#xD;
      risk factor level at baseline. The relative risk of cardiovascular disease was calculated for&#xD;
      each risk factor. Multivariable analyses were carried out in the third phase. Regression&#xD;
      models were used to determine independent and interactive effects of the identified risk&#xD;
      factors on the incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
