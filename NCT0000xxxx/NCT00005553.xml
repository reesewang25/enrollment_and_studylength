      To evaluate children undergoing catheter ablation at pediatric centers in North America in&#xD;
      order to provide information on the incidence rate of serious cardiac damage as a result of&#xD;
      ablation, the incidence rate and time course of recurrence after initially successful&#xD;
      ablation, and the incidence rate of proarrhythmia following ablation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency catheter ablation is a catheterization laboratory technique for the cure of&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmias, which has become common in pediatric cardiology practice. Recent&#xD;
      analyses have suggested that ablation therapy is more cost-effective compared not only with&#xD;
      surgery, but also with antiarrhythmic medication. Despite a good initial success rate of the&#xD;
      technique, and a low initial complication rate, there is concern about possible long-term&#xD;
      effects with the technique in the pediatric age group. There are reports not only of damage&#xD;
      to cardiac valves, but also the development of new arrhythmias, including sudden death, as a&#xD;
      result of ablations in children. Recurrences are observed frequently following initially&#xD;
      successful procedures. Finally, there are animal data to suggest that immature myocardium is&#xD;
      more prone to severe damage as a result of ablation procedures. Few, if any, data exist to&#xD;
      support the long-term safety of these ablation techniques in children. Therefore, before&#xD;
      ablation therapy becomes the standard approach in children, it is important to carefully&#xD;
      assess the long-term risks in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-center, prospective, five-year study. The collection of these data was intended to&#xD;
      provide the following information: 1) the incidence of serious cardiac damage as a result of&#xD;
      ablation; 2) the incidence and time course of recurrence after initially successful ablation;&#xD;
      and 3) the incidence of proarrhythmia following ablation. A total of 480 pediatric patients&#xD;
      were enrolled prospectively and evaluated both before ablation of supraventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia and at intervals following ablation with clinical history and examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, 24-hour Holter monitor, and echocardiogram, with non-invasive studies read&#xD;
      by outside consultants. In addition, a complete Registry of pediatric patients undergoing&#xD;
      ablation at the participating centers was established to allow comparisons with the study&#xD;
      group and to provide population estimates of success and complication rates.&#xD;
