  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The idiotype of the immunoglobulin on a given B cell malignancy (Id) can serve as a clonal&#xD;
      marker, and a previous pilot study in lymphoma patients has demonstrated that autologous Id&#xD;
      protein can be formulated into an immunogenic, tumor specific antigen by conjugation to a&#xD;
      carrier protein (KLH) and administration with an emulsion-based adjuvant. The goals of&#xD;
      vaccine development in the current study are to develop vaccines: 1) with improved potency&#xD;
      and 2) which are more effective at inducing cell-mediated immune responses. The selection of&#xD;
      GM-CSF as the immunological &quot;adjuvant&quot; is a direct extension of our laboratory studies in&#xD;
      small animal models demonstrating that GM-CSF can enhance the potency of the prototype Id-KLH&#xD;
      vaccine by augmenting almost exclusively the cellular arm of the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are: 1) to evaluate cellular and humoral immune responses&#xD;
      against the unique idiotype of the patient's lymphoma and 2) to evaluate the ability of the&#xD;
      Id vaccine to clear the bone marrow of malignant cells detectable by pathologic examination&#xD;
      or molecular examination (polymerase chain reaction amplification of the rearranged bcl-2&#xD;
      oncogene).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to treat previously untreated patients with follicular lymphomas to&#xD;
      complete remission or minimal residual disease with ProMACE chemotherapy. Three to six months&#xD;
      after completion of chemotherapy, in an effort to reduce the relapse rate (by eradicating&#xD;
      microscopic disease resistant to chemotherapy), patients will receive an autologous Id&#xD;
      vaccine administered in combination with GM-CSF. Id-KLH (0.5 mg) is administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously. GM-CSF is administered subcutaneously locally with the vaccine on the day of&#xD;
      vaccination and for the three consecutive days following vaccination as close to the initial&#xD;
      vaccination site as possible at one of two doses (patients are randomized to either a high or&#xD;
      low dose, 500 or 100 micrograms/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to accrue 42 patients. Twenty-nine patients have been enrolled. Sixteen patients have&#xD;
      entered and/or completed the vaccination phase. Patients have demonstrated significant&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative responses specific for autologous idiotype of a magnitude which is&#xD;
      significantly greater than previously observed.&#xD;
