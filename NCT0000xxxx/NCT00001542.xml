      This is a placebo-controlled trial of intermittent fluconazole prophylaxis (200 mg orally&#xD;
      three times a week) in the prevention of thrush.&#xD;

      Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) occurs in up to 93% of persons with human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV) infection at some time during the course of their illness. OPC usually responds&#xD;
      well to initial antifungal therapy, but with increasing immunodeficiency it usually recurs&#xD;
      and can become resistant to clinical and microbiologic cure. Therapy usually begins with&#xD;
      topical agents, followed by systemic therapy with azole antifungals when those fail.&#xD;
      Amphotericin B is also used, but is less well tolerated and usually only effective in&#xD;
      parenteral form. Because of its bioavailability and efficacy, fluconazole has become the most&#xD;
      commonly used agent in treating OPC. Recurrences have often led to frequent re-treatment or&#xD;
      prophylactic therapy with fluconazole. Daily prophylaxis with fluconazole (200 mg) has been&#xD;
      shown to decrease the incidence of OPC. With the widespread and prolonged use of fluconazole&#xD;
      reports of clinical failures and yeasts with decreased susceptibilities have appeared. This&#xD;
      resistance appears to be associated with advanced immunosuppression and azole exposure. The&#xD;
      most effective regimen to decrease relapse and morbidity from OPC which minimizes development&#xD;
      of resistance has not been established. Could less frequent and/or lower dose prophylaxis&#xD;
      with fluconazole decrease the incidence of recurrences while slowing the development of drug&#xD;
      resistance?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to perform a two phase study of low-dose fluconazole prophylaxis in HIV infected&#xD;
      patients with a history of OPC. Patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 less than or&#xD;
      equal to 150 cell/mm3) who have not received prior fluconazole prophylaxis will be included.&#xD;
      Phase 1 of the study will be a placebo-controlled trial of fluconazole at a dose of 200 mg&#xD;
      three times weekly. Phase 1 will examine whether this low-dose prophylaxis can delay&#xD;
      recurrence of OPC. Phase 2 of the study will be an open-label prophylaxis with fluconazole at&#xD;
      first 200mg thrice weekly, then 200mg daily as patients develop recurrent OPC. In this phase&#xD;
      the primary question to be answered will be whether subjects starting in the placebo arm of&#xD;
      Phase 1 will progress more or less rapidly to clinical fluconazole failure compared to those&#xD;
      starting in the fluconazole arm. We will learn more about the natural history of fluconazole&#xD;
      resistance, including how gradually the change occurs, how much fluconazole the patient has&#xD;
      received at the time resistance develops and whether the resistance occurs in the patient's&#xD;
      own isolate or from acquisition of a new isolate. Other evaluations will include compliance,&#xD;
      cost, and host and organism-associated factors. If thrice weekly fluconazole prophylaxis can&#xD;
      increase the time to development of resistance and decrease episodes of OPC in this group of&#xD;
      severely immunocompromised individuals, it would increase the effective use (to include&#xD;
      cost-effective use) of fluconazole in the treatment of OPC.&#xD;
