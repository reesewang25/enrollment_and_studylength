      To determine the safety and tolerance of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in patients with AIDS-related&#xD;
      Kaposi's sarcoma. To determine the effects of IL-4 on tumor growth in patients with&#xD;
      AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.&#xD;

      IL-4 exhibits a variety of beneficial effects on the immune system and is a potent inhibitor&#xD;
      of Kaposi's sarcoma cells in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified into two groups according to CD4 count (less than 100 cells/mm3 and&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm3) and are enrolled in cohorts of four patients at each&#xD;
      of four dose levels of IL-4 per stratum. Within each stratum, if patients at a given dose&#xD;
      level have received at least 2 weeks of study therapy and no more than two patients&#xD;
      experienced grade 3 or 4 drug-related toxicity, dose escalation in subsequent patients may&#xD;
      begin. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 50 percent of patients develop grade 3 or&#xD;
      worse toxicity. Patients with CD4 count less than 500 cells/mm3 (per 12/30/94 amendment) must&#xD;
      be on antiretroviral therapy during study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: Group I - enrollment is closed, the objective has been defined. Group&#xD;
      II - patients must have CD4 cells greater than or equal to 100/mm3 and less than 500/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: All patients will receive antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
