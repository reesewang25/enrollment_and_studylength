    <textblock>
      To determine the pharmacokinetics profile of single doses of nitazoxanide (NTZ) in patients&#xD;
      with AIDS-related cryptosporidial diarrhea. To determine steady state concentrations of NTZ&#xD;
      following repeated dosing. To assess the safety and efficacy of 4 dose levels of NTZ in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryptosporidial enterocolitis in AIDS patients is frequently chronic and severe, contributing&#xD;
      substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in this population. NTZ exhibits&#xD;
      antimicrobial activity that may extend to Cryptosporidial infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cryptosporidial enterocolitis in AIDS patients is frequently chronic and severe, contributing&#xD;
      substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in this population. NTZ exhibits&#xD;
      antimicrobial activity that may extend to Cryptosporidial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are enrolled in groups of 7. Group A receives the lowest dose of NTZ. Groups B - D&#xD;
      receive sequentially higher doses. Patients in Groups B - D do not begin therapy until all&#xD;
      patients have been enrolled at the preceding dose. For determination of single-dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, patients receive a single dose of NTZ on Day 1 and blood samples are&#xD;
      obtained over the next 24 hours. Immediately following the 24-hour blood sample collection,&#xD;
      patients begin the treatment phase during which they take NTZ for an additional 13 days.&#xD;
      Blood samples are obtained again on Day 14 to determine full plasma concentration-time&#xD;
      profiles over the dosing interval. At the end of treatment, responders discontinue treatment&#xD;
      and nonresponders continue NTZ treatment for an additional 14 days on the same dose. Patients&#xD;
      who still fail to respond are provided with an additional month of NTZ. Patients have&#xD;
      scheduled visits for clinical and parasitologic efficacy assessments and safety laboratory&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AIDS diagnosis according to CDC criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4 count less than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 or CD4 count greater than or equal to&#xD;
             200 cells/mm3 and documented cryptosporidiosis for a minimum of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cryptosporidial diarrhea as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) presence of Cryptosporidium oocytes in a stool specimen within 14 days of&#xD;
             enrollment; and (2) chronic diarrhea (i.e., an average of at least 4 bowel movements&#xD;
             per day for a minimum of 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to tolerate food by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Required:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any anti-diarrheal or anti-emetic medication for which the dosage regimen has been&#xD;
             stable for at least 1 week prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any antiretroviral medications (e.g., zidovudine, ddI, ddC) for which the dosage&#xD;
             regimen has been stable for at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medication for prophylaxis or maintenance therapy of opportunistic infection, stable for at&#xD;
        least 2 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Co-existing Condition:&#xD;

        Grade 4 (hematologic) or Grade 3 (for all others) toxicity. (Patients with Grade 3 toxicity&#xD;
        for hepatic parameters may be enrolled if, in the investigator's judgment, the&#xD;
        abnormalities are due to biliary cryptosporidiosis.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba&#xD;

             stool (based on assessment within 14 days prior to enrollment by stool ova and&#xD;
             parasite examination, culture, and C. difficile assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of intestinal Mycobacterium avium intracellular infection or intestinal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of Cytomegalovirus colitis, unless 28 days of therapy with ganciclovir or&#xD;

&#xD;
        Prior Medication:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Investigational drug therapy within 14 days of enrollment, unless available under an&#xD;
             FDA-authorized expanded access program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any drug or therapy with possible anticryptosporidial activity (e.g., paromomycin,&#xD;

             of enrollment.&#xD;
