  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to compare differences in brain&#xD;
      structure, chemistry, and functioning in individuals with brain and mental disorders compared&#xD;
      to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that results from subtle changes and abnormalities in&#xD;
      neurons. These deficits likely occur in localized regions of the brain and may result in&#xD;
      widespread, devastating consequences. The neuronal abnormalities are inherited through a&#xD;
      complex combination of genetic and environmental factors. Brain imaging technologies can be&#xD;
      used to better characterize brain changes in individuals with schizophrenia. This study will&#xD;
      use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to identify predictable, quantifiable&#xD;
      abnormalities in neurophysiology, neurochemistry and neuroanatomy that characterize&#xD;
      schizophrenia and other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is meant to provide a matrix for multiple, simultaneous brain imaging&#xD;
      investigations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We intend to study regional brain&#xD;
      structure, physiology, and biochemistry in living human subjects, both healthy and ill. Based&#xD;
      on multiple clinical, neuropathological, and functional neuroimaging studies, it is clear&#xD;
      that schizophrenia is a brain disorder arising from subtle neuronal deficits (for lack of&#xD;
      more specific terminology). These deficits likely arise in a few key regions such as&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampal formation, that result in widespread,&#xD;
      multifaceted, and devastating clinical consequences. These neuronal deficits are clearly&#xD;
      heritable, although in a complex fashion from multiple genes interacting in an epistatic&#xD;
      fashion with each other and the environment. We hypothesize that these neuronal deficits,&#xD;
      clearly resulting in quantifiable behavioral abnormalities in schizophrenic patients, will&#xD;
      produce predictable, quantifiable aberrations in neurophysiology that we can &quot;map&quot; using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging. In spite of numerous functional imaging findings, clinical&#xD;
      applications remain scarce and pathognomic findings absent. Therefore, we do not anticipate&#xD;
      that an approach based solely on any one modality is likely to significantly advance our&#xD;
      knowledge base. Instead, we propose to create brain imaging datasets for individual human&#xD;
      subjects predicated on 1) the appraisal of brain function from multiple domains&#xD;
      simultaneously; 2) the characterization of brain function via summation and intercorrelation&#xD;
      of these data; and 3) the digestion of these data based on the parsing of complex clinical&#xD;
      phenomenology into quantifiable neurophysiological parameters. Thus, in addition to the&#xD;
      identification of those parameters that best characterize and identify manifest schizophrenia&#xD;
      (i.e., state variables), we hypothesize that some of these fundamental characteristics will&#xD;
      be heritable. These fundamental characteristics, so-called endo- or intermediate phenotypes,&#xD;
      represent powerful tools to find susceptibility genes and have already generated a number of&#xD;
      linkage findings.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        CONTROLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No psychiatric or severe chronic medical illness at the time of the study, and by history.&#xD;
        This includes the absence of substance abuse histories, learning disabilities and all DSM&#xD;
        IV disorders. The investigators will evaluate medical histories and medical conditions that&#xD;
        are judged not to interfere with the study may be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No use of psychotropic substances in the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There is no upper age limit. The lower age limit is 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Schizophrenia, any subtype or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM IV, as detailed in&#xD;
        protocol # 89-M-0160 (&quot;Inpatient Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Inpatients&quot;) and #95-M-0150&#xD;
        (&quot;A Longitudinal Investigation of Siblings of Schizophrenic and Manic-Depressive&#xD;
        Patients&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features according to DSM IV as detailed in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Menstrually-Related Mood Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mild to Moderate Parkinson's Disease (Hoehn and Yahr Stage 1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        CONTROLS AND PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Impaired hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Head trauma with loss of consciousness in the last year, or any evidence of functional&#xD;
        impairment due to and persisting after head trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or healthy volunteers with a known risk from exposure to high magnetic fields&#xD;
        (e.g. patients with pace makers) and those who have metallic implants (e.g. braces) in the&#xD;
        head region (likely to create artifact on the MRI scans) will be excluded from&#xD;
        participating in the fMRI studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Coexistence of another major mental illness at the time of the study. If the patients&#xD;
        experienced other mental illnesses in the past (e.g. major depression), then this should be&#xD;
        judged to be fully recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for substance abuse met in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for substance dependence in the last year. If criteria for dependence were met in&#xD;
        the past, then the duration of the disorder was less than 3 years, or not judged to have&#xD;
        produced long-term brain changes to allow the patient to be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Major concurrent medical illness likely to interfere with the acquisition of the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concomitant medications which could interfere with performance on the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of dyskinetic movements of the face and tongue (likely to interfere with eyeblink&#xD;
        measures, or of gross involuntary movements of the whole body (likely to interfere with&#xD;
        positioning in the MRI scanner).&#xD;
