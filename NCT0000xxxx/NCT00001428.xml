      This protocol will evaluate the activity of 5-Fluorouracil (FUra) given as a 1 hour infusion&#xD;
      in combination with leucovorin (LV) and interferon IFN alpha-2a in patients with advanced,&#xD;
      measurable colorectal cancer. IFN alpha-2a will be given at 5 million U/m(2) SC days 1-6; LV,&#xD;
      200 mg/m(2), will be given as a short infusion over 30 minutes days 2-6, followed immediately&#xD;
      by a 1 hour IV infusion of FUra days 2-6. The starting dose of FUra will be 425 mg/m(2)/d(1).&#xD;
      Cycles will be repeated at three week intervals provided that the granulocyte count and&#xD;
      platelet count have recovered to &amp;gte; 1200/microL and &amp;gte; 80,000/microL, respectively, and&#xD;
      all non-hematologic toxicity has resolved. The dose of FUra will be adjusted according to&#xD;
      individual tolerance. Preliminary experience with FUra given as a 1 hour infusion suggests&#xD;
      that it is less toxic. The primary goal of this study is to determine if this less toxic&#xD;
      regimen retains clinical antitumor activity. FUra plasma samples will be obtained the initial&#xD;
      cycle at 50 and 55 minutes during the first 1 hour infusion of FUra to permit documentation&#xD;
      of achieved plasma levels and to permit correlation between FUra pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      clinical toxicity and/or response. Pharmacokinetic sampling will be repeated if the dose of&#xD;
      FUra is increased or decreased in subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified according to whether or not they have received prior adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. A two-stage design will be employed for patients with no prior chemotherapy: If&#xD;
      less than or equal to 4 responses are seen among the initial 20 previously untreated&#xD;
      patients, accrual will cease. If greater than or equal to 5 responses are seen in the initial&#xD;
      20 patients, however, accrual will be expanded to 40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourteen patients who have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy (completing it at least 6&#xD;
      months prior to study entry) or have received prior FUra only as a radiation sensitizer will&#xD;
      be entered. If no responses are seen, accrual to this cohort will cease. If greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 1 response is seen, accrual may be expanded to 24 patients.&#xD;
