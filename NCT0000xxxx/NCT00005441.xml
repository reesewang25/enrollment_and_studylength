      To develop and evaluate a comprehensive lifestyle self-management (CLSM) program (low-fat&#xD;
      vegetarian diet, smoking cessation and stress management training) for postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with coronary heart disease and Type II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death among postmenopausal women. Yet few&#xD;
      studies have examined the potential for altering risk factors for coronary heart diseases&#xD;
      among postmenopausal women, especially as a result of comprehensive lifestyle changes. A&#xD;
      pressing need existed for controlled studies to evaluate the effects of comprehensive&#xD;
      lifestyle changes on risks for coronary heart disease among postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comprehensive lifestyle management program appeared to produce substantial cardiovascular&#xD;
      benefits among men but little was known about the behavioral processes through which change&#xD;
      occurred. Its generalizability and applicability -- especially for high-risk women --was&#xD;
      uncertain. The program was compared to a usual care condition in an initial randomized trial.&#xD;
      Outcome measures included patient self-care behaviors and health outcomes (serum lipid&#xD;
      profiles, blood pressure, relative weight, and glycemic control). Process measures included&#xD;
      self-efficacy, personal health models, perceived stress, social support and problem-solving&#xD;
      skills. Subjects participated in the intervention for three years, with gradual fading of the&#xD;
      program in the third year to evaluate the long-term effects of the program. Analyses included&#xD;
      assessments of between groups differences on physiological risk factors, behavioral&#xD;
      (lifestyle) measures and process measures as well as maintenance over time. Based upon the&#xD;
      results of this study, the long-term goal was to design a second outcome study in which the&#xD;
      revised intervention would be evaluated with a larger sample to determine the relative&#xD;
      contribution of adding moderate exercise and the effects on reversal of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
