  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a longitudinal, natural history study of cardiovascular disease risk factors in&#xD;
      children. Growth curves were compared for levels of blood pressure, lipids, cardiac&#xD;
      structures and function, and related to physical growth and maturation, nutrient intake,&#xD;
      physical activity, body composition, puberty, and smoking.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the pathologic precursors of atherosclerosis and the development of its major risk&#xD;
      factors -- blood pressure, blood lipids, and cigarette smoking -- are often far advanced&#xD;
      before age 20 or within the period from birth or conception through adolescence. In 1990,&#xD;
      there was growing interest in understanding these aspects of human biology and in devising&#xD;
      appropriate preventive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1990, knowledge about the risk factors during childhood and adolescence was based mainly&#xD;
      on cross-sectional surveys, from which very striking and consistent patterns of change with&#xD;
      age were inferred, and from which reference values for screening and management were derived.&#xD;
      Both growth and sexual maturation influence these patterns strongly, yet these risk factors&#xD;
      had only recently been taken into account in 1990, only partially in screening&#xD;
      recommendations for blood pressure and not at all for cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were selected by simple random sampling. Data were collected on dependent variables&#xD;
      including blood pressure, heart rate, echocardiography, Doppler flow, blood lipids, and&#xD;
      smoking. Independent variables included growth, diet and nutrition, electrolytes, physical&#xD;
      activity and fitness, personal, family, and social history, and bone age. Most observations&#xD;
      were recorded at four month intervals. There was a six month pretest recruitment period, four&#xD;
      years of cycled measurements and data collection, and six months of analysis and reporting.&#xD;
      Curves for both velocity and acceleration of growth for attained levels of blood pressure,&#xD;
      blood lipids, and smoking were determined as were longitudinal relationships between&#xD;
      individual growth curves of blood pressure, echocardiographic measures, physical growth,&#xD;
      sexual maturation, body composition, diet, physical activity, and social factors.&#xD;
