  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine sleep duration varies greatly among individuals. The biological meaning of this&#xD;
      variation is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term circadian rhythm refers to the biological clock that regulates the timing of falling&#xD;
      asleep, waking up, and secretion of hormones, like melatonin. Melatonin is secreted at night.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that melatonin may play a role in the regulation of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether the duration of nighttime (nocturnal) melatonin&#xD;
      secretion is longer in people with long regular sleep duration than people with short sleep&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare levels of melatonin and cortisol, body temperature, sleepiness, and&#xD;
      sleep in two extreme groups. Group one will be made up of people with short sleep duration&#xD;
      lasting less than 6 hours. Group two will be made up of people with long sleep duration&#xD;
      lasting more than 9 hours.&#xD;

      Habitual sleep duration varies greatly among individuals. The biological meaning of this&#xD;
      variation is unknown. The present project proposes that differences in habitual sleep&#xD;
      duration are associated with differences in the output of the endogenous circadian pacemaker,&#xD;
      which programs the 'internal biological night'. The protocol hypothesizes that the duration&#xD;
      of the internal biological night as defined by the nocturnal intervals of detectable plasma&#xD;
      melatonin levels, low body temperature, low EEG activity in the high-frequency alpha band,&#xD;
      increasing sleepiness and increasing plasma cortisol levels is longer in habitual long&#xD;
      sleepers (sleep duration greater than 9 hours) than in short sleepers (less than 6 hours).&#xD;
      Since recent results in healthy subjects suggest that melatonin has some soporific or&#xD;
      hypnotic properties, we furthermore hypothesize that the level of nocturnal melatonin&#xD;
      secretion is higher in long sleepers than in short sleepers. The circadian rhythms of plasma&#xD;
      melatonin, body temperature, waking EEG activity, subjective sleepiness and plasma cortisol&#xD;
      will be assessed in a ~40-hour constant routine protocol. In addition, a 36-hour extended bed&#xD;
      rest protocol will be carried out in order to study spontaneous sleep duration and sleep&#xD;
      structure under ad lib conditions while time cues and social cues are absent. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that as a consequence of differences in the circadian output, long sleepers will&#xD;
      sleep more, have a different sleep structure, and spontaneously wake up on a lower level of&#xD;
      homeostatic sleep pressure than short sleepers. Finally, we intend to determine whether&#xD;
      differences in habitual sleep duration between long and short sleepers are associated with&#xD;
      dysthymic and hypomanic characteristics of mood, respectively. We are asking to study a total&#xD;
      of 15 long sleepers and 15 short sleepers. Given that we have already studied 9 long sleepers&#xD;
      and 9 short sleepers, we anticipate that 72 patient-days per year for one year would be&#xD;
      required to complete the study.&#xD;
