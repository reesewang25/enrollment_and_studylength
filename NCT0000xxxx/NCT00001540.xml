  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and utility of bacteriophage phi X174&#xD;
      immunization as a tool to assess the immune competence of HIV-infected patients at different&#xD;
      stages of disease in vivo, and to assess the impact of viral load levels and therapy-induced&#xD;
      changes in viral load levels on the response to immunization with the neo-antigen&#xD;
      bacteriophage phi X174. Bacteriophage phi X174 immunization is a method that has been in use&#xD;
      for more than 25 years to assess the immunity of patients with various types of primary and&#xD;
      secondary immunodeficiencies, including 48 HIV-infected patients. This is a prospective&#xD;
      open-label, controlled study which will enroll 39 HIV-infected patients and 13 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, male or female with 18 years of age and over. The HIV-infected patients will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups according to their CD4 cell count: less than 200 cells/mm(3), between&#xD;
      200 and 500 cells/mm(3) and greater than 500 cells/mm(3). After screening and a two week&#xD;
      pre-study evaluation, all eligible participants will receive a primary, secondary and&#xD;
      tertiary immunization with 2 x 10(9) PFU/kg of bacteriophage phi X174 six weeks apart.&#xD;
      Patients who present with detectable levels of viral load at entry will be offered a more&#xD;
      effective antiviral drug regimen. Patients will have to be on a stable antiviral regimen for&#xD;
      at least one month prior to receiving the primary immunization. Patients will return for&#xD;
      visits 1, 2 and 4 weeks after each immunization for clinical and laboratory evaluations. The&#xD;
      study endpoints are: safety (as measured by incidence of adverse events, CD4 cell count and&#xD;
      HIV plasma RNA), kinetics of bacteriophage clearance following primary immunization,&#xD;
      quantitation of bacteriophage phi X174 specific antibody titers following primary, secondary&#xD;
      and tertiary immunizations and determination of qualitative and quantitative antibody isotype&#xD;
      switching following secondary and tertiary immunizations.&#xD;
