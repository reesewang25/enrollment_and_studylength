    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study genetic testing and the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating&#xD;
      patients who have solid tumors and lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to&#xD;
      stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Genetic testing for a specific&#xD;
      enzyme may help doctors determine whether side effects from or response to chemotherapy are&#xD;
      related to a person's genetic makeup&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Classify patients with solid tumors or lymphoma according to UGT1A1 promoter (TATA box)&#xD;
      and coding region (Gly71Arg) mutation, and CYP3A4 promoter (G to A) polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify UGT1A1 enzyme glucuronidator and irinotecan oxidizer phenotypes in these&#xD;
      patients and determine the correlation between the two metabolic reactions in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the relationship between UGT1A1 genotype (promoter and/or coding region&#xD;
      mutation) and CYP3A4 promoter genotype vs gastrointestinal or bone marrow toxicity, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are genotyped for UGT1A1 enzyme and classified as &quot;Gilbert's&quot; (7/7),&#xD;
      &quot;heterozygotes&quot; (6/7), and &quot;homozygotes for allele 6&quot; (6/6). The DNA is analyzed for the&#xD;
      UGT1A1 coding region mutation (Gly71Arg) and CYP3A4 promoter polymorphism. Patients are also&#xD;
      examined for glucuronidator ratio of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, and&#xD;
      classified as &quot;low/slow&quot; (very low or zero SN-38G/SN-38 ratio), &quot;intermediate&quot; (less than 50%&#xD;
      normal ratio), or &quot;normal&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at&#xD;
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>A Cochran-Armitage test for trend will be used to determine whether there is a linear trend in the proportion of patients within each genotype experiencing grade 3-4 diarrhea. Similarly, trend analysis will be performed to determine if there is a linear trend in the proportion of patients within each phenotype experiencing grade 3-4 myelosuppression. Genotype (3 ordered levels) will be modeled as a function of metabolic ratios and biliary index to determine whether these are independent.</description>
