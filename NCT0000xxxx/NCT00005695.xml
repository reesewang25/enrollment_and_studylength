      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were two specific aims. The first was to test the hypothesis that controlled physical&#xD;
      training (PT) reduced blood pressure, at rest and in reaction to forehead cold and exercise&#xD;
      stressors, in 8-9 year olds who were high in both blood pressure and body fatness. Subjects&#xD;
      were divided equally on gender and blood pressure and body fatness. Subjects were divided&#xD;
      equally on gender and ethnicity (black/white). Both resting and reactive blood pressure were&#xD;
      correlated with left ventricular mass and were predictive of future essential hypertension.&#xD;
      The underlying hemodynamic regulators of blood pressure, cardiac output and the total&#xD;
      peripheral resistance, were measured with impedance cardiography to explore hemodynamic&#xD;
      mechanisms through which training had a favorable influence on blood pressure and left&#xD;
      ventricular mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim tested the hypothesis that physical training reduced percent body fat, as&#xD;
      measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Children above the 70th percentile in&#xD;
      both blood pressure and fatness were randomly assigned, within ethnicity and gender, to a&#xD;
      physical training or waiting list control group. After the physical training group underwent&#xD;
      four months of training, all subjects were retested and these data were used to test the&#xD;
      primary hypotheses. The initial control subjects then performed four months of physical&#xD;
      training, after which they were retested. The data from this second phase were added to the&#xD;
      data of the initial physical training group to explore interactions of training with gender&#xD;
      and ethnicity. The initial physical training group was brought back four months after&#xD;
      cessation of training to see if the changes elicited by the training were reversible. To&#xD;
      document the stimulation provided by the training, heart rate was monitored during training&#xD;
      sessions. To observe the time course of changes between the full lab testing sessions,&#xD;
      skinfolds and resting blood pressure were measured monthly. Diet and free living physical&#xD;
      activity were assessed to help explain changes in body composition. Aerobic fitness was&#xD;
      measured with treadmill tests of maximal oxygen consumption.&#xD;
