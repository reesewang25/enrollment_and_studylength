      This study began as an efficacy study of interferon alpha-2a in patients with hairy cell&#xD;
      leukemia. It was observed that most patients responded with interferon, but that very few&#xD;
      complete responses were being obtained. Studies being done elsewhere confirmed the low&#xD;
      complete remission rate. Once interferon was stopped, nearly uniformly disease progression&#xD;
      requiring reinstitution of therapy was observed. There appear to be very few if any patients&#xD;
      who will not require further therapy after receiving 12 or 18 months of continuous interferon&#xD;
      treatment. Because of these findings, and in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      long-term recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-Alpha) in patients with hairy cell leukemia, we&#xD;
      opted to administer interferon continuously to patients who were initially responsive to this&#xD;
      drug. Of the 53 evaluable patients (of the 56 entered on this study), there was one complete&#xD;
      remission, 41 partial remissions, 1 minor response, 9 patients with stable disease and only 1&#xD;
      patient with disease progression. Fourteen patients continue to receive interferon without&#xD;
      interruption with a median duration of continuous interferon treatment of 9.2 years.&#xD;
      Thirty-four patients discontinued interferon for a variety of reasons, the most common being&#xD;
      the development of acquired interferon resistance in association with interferon antibodies.&#xD;
      The resistance to interferon was manifested early, in the first 18 months of treatment,&#xD;
      except in two cases. An important finding in this study is the continued slow, but&#xD;
      significant, hematologic improvement in absolute granulocyte and platelet counts beyond 18&#xD;
      months of therapy, thereby indicating that prolonged treatment results in continued benefit&#xD;
      rather than the production of antibodies with subsequent development of interferon&#xD;
      resistance. Although it is clear from this study that hairy cell leukemia can be controlled&#xD;
      in the long-term with interferon, longer follow-up will be necessary to determine if&#xD;
      continuous therapy with interferon is better than intermittent therapy. The optimal therapy&#xD;
      for hairy cell leukemia remains open to discussion. Although early reports suggested that&#xD;
      2-chlorodeoxyadenosine was curative, additional studies with longer periods of follow up&#xD;
      suggests that as many as 30% of patients will relapse. This study provides the only instance&#xD;
      where continuous long term treatment with interferon has been evaluated. This provides an&#xD;
      opportunity to evaluate the long term toxicity of chronic interferon therapy, the long term&#xD;
      efficacy of this treatment and to evaluate the potential benefits of long term interferon in&#xD;
      preventing second malignancies, a complication noted in about 15% of patients treated in&#xD;
      other fashions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their initial clinical evaluation, patients were given 3 million units of recombinant&#xD;
      IFN-Alpha subcutaneously daily for 4 to 6 months. In responding patients, maintenance therapy&#xD;
      was given at a dose of three million units subcutaneously 3 times per week. Responding&#xD;
      patients have continued on therapy indefinitely.&#xD;
