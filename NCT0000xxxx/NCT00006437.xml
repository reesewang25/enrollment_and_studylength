  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare blood from healthy volunteers and with wound fluid and tissue samples&#xD;
      from patients with acute and chronic wounds enrolled in other NIH studies. Chronic wounds,&#xD;
      such as venous leg ulcers, pressure sores, ischemic ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, affect&#xD;
      more than 4 million Americans each year and cost about $9 billion to treat. The nature of&#xD;
      these wounds is not well understood and treatments are not always successful, for unknown&#xD;
      reasons. Blood collected from healthy volunteers will be used to prepare a model for studying&#xD;
      various processes involved in wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age and older who do not smoke and have no medical&#xD;
      problems of the heart, bones, muscles, stomach, lungs, blood, or nervous system, do not have&#xD;
      problems going to the bathroom, and have no infections may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be interviewed briefly for information on their date of birth, gender,&#xD;
      ethnic identity and medical history and will have a brief physical examination, including a&#xD;
      check of height and weight, vital signs and heart and lung sounds. About 14 milliliters (2&#xD;
      tablespoons) of blood will be drawn from the arm.&#xD;

      Chronic wounds are &quot;any interruption on the continuity of the body's tissue that requires a&#xD;
      prolonged time to heal, does not heal, or recurs&quot; (Wysocki, 1996). Venous leg ulcers,&#xD;
      pressure sores, ischemic ulcers, and diabetic foot ulcers are examples of chronic wounds.&#xD;
      These kinds of wounds affect over 4 million Americans each year and cost over $9 billion to&#xD;
      treat. The pathophysiology of these wounds is not well understood and therapies directed at&#xD;
      healing these wounds are not always successful for unknown reasons. To better understand the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of these wounds we propose to collect blood by venipuncture from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Blood will be used to prepare blood and plasma derived serum for use in an in&#xD;
      vitro wound healing model and Boyden chamber assays to study cell migration, adhesion,&#xD;
      genetic expression, expression of cell surface receptors, and protein expression to construct&#xD;
      a profile of various healing processes. This baseline data will be used for studying the&#xD;
      effect of acute and chronic wound fluids on cell migration, adhesion, genetic expression,&#xD;
      expression of cell surface receptor and protein expression in an in vitro wound model&#xD;
      (protocols to be submitted for each patient population).&#xD;

        Male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
