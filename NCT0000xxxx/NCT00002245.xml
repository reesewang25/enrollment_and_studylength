      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 3-drug anti-HIV regimen, amprenavir&#xD;
      (APV) plus abacavir (ABC) plus lamivudine (3TC), on the way carbohydrates (sugars) and fats&#xD;
      are metabolized (processed by the body) in HIV-infected patients who have received little or&#xD;
      no previous anti-HIV drug therapy.&#xD;

      This single-site study uses an open-label, single-arm design to evaluate the effects of APV,&#xD;
      a protease inhibitor (PI), plus concurrent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
      (NRTIs) ABC and 3TC on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in non-diabetic, HIV-1 infected&#xD;
      patients initiating antiretroviral therapy. Treatment duration is 24 weeks, and patients&#xD;
      serve as their own controls. The combination therapy is evaluated for safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      efficacy, and effects on body composition. The proportion of patients who attain plasma HIV&#xD;
      RNA below the lower limit of quantitation of the Roche Amplicor (less than 400 copies/ml) and&#xD;
      Ultrasensitive (less than 50 copies/ml) is measured at 24 weeks after starting therapy with&#xD;
      APV plus ABC plus 3TC.&#xD;

             taken ABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a CD4 count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 within 30 days prior to study&#xD;
