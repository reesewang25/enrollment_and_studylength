      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese children who engage in vigorous exercise programs show beneficial effects on total body&#xD;
      percent fat (percent BF) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT); however, little is known about&#xD;
      how to prevent accretion of total body or visceral adiposity in high risk youths, such as&#xD;
      African-American (AA) females.The project has important health implications for two reasons,&#xD;
      as follows. There is a dearth of information concerning the effects of exercise interventions&#xD;
      in school and community settings. If the study shows that an afternoon exercise program&#xD;
      reduces accretion of general and visceral adiposity and has a favorable impact on fitness and&#xD;
      health in a population that is at high risk of obesity, then schools may be encouraged to&#xD;
      implement similar interventions to prevent juvenile obesity and associated health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was awarded in response to a Program Announcement on Physical Activity and&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Health released in October 1994 jointly by the NHLBI, the National Institute&#xD;
      of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the National Institute of Nursing&#xD;
      Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design involves randomization of 200 African American girls, eight to 10 years of age&#xD;
      into intervention or control groups. After one year, the groups are compared to test the&#xD;
      primary hypothesis that a one year afternoon exercise program will reduce accretion of&#xD;
      general and visceral adiposity in these girls. Then the girls will switch group assignments&#xD;
      for the next year. The pattern of data over the three time points will show what happens over&#xD;
      a two year period in which the youths are, or are not, involved in the exercise program. The&#xD;
      measurements will include: (1) percent body fat with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; (2)&#xD;
      visceral adipose tissue (VAT) with magnetic resonance imaging; (3) cardiovascular fitness&#xD;
      with a multi-stage treadmill test; (4) cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (i.e., the&#xD;
      ratio of total to high density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, systolic blood pressure, and&#xD;
      fibrinogen); (5) free-living exercise and diet; (6) psychosocial variables (i.e.,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and self-concept); (7) sexual maturation; (8) anthropometric measures. The&#xD;
      exercise program will be implemented in neighborhood schools for 90 minutes each weekday&#xD;
      afternoon. Transportation will be provided if needed. Sessions will include motor skill&#xD;
      instruction and aerobic exercises.&#xD;
