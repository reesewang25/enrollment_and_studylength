      To provide zalcitabine ( ddC ) for patients with AIDS or Advanced ARC in whom zidovudine (&#xD;
      AZT ) is contraindicated, or who have failed treatment with or are intolerant to AZT and to&#xD;
      demonstrate that ddC monotherapy is safe, and tolerable in this patient population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aerosolized Pentamidine or Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis against&#xD;
             Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dapsone is permitted but discouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs that could cause other serious toxicity when coadministered with study&#xD;
             medication is allowed for treatment of an acute intercurrent illness or opportunistic&#xD;
             infection at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medication that has the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy should be&#xD;
             avoided; patients should consult their physicians for specific drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isoniazid is permitted if there is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy at entry and&#xD;
             the patient is taking pyridoxine = or &gt; 50 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metronidazole is permitted only with a study drug interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on amphotericin, pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,&#xD;
             ganciclovir, intravenous pentamidine, intravenous acyclovir = or &gt; 1000 mg/day orally&#xD;
             or other bone marrow or renal toxic drugs may not tolerate concomitant ddC. If these&#xD;
             drugs are given concomitantly with ddC, patients should have frequent (weekly)&#xD;
             laboratory assessments, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs that are nephrotoxic or have the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy might&#xD;
             be expected to cause increased toxicity when co-administered with ddC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following experimental medications are allowed if, in the judgement of the&#xD;
             investigator, no serious additive toxicities are anticipated and the experimental drug&#xD;
             is necessary for optimal patient management:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ampligen, azithromycin, BW 566C80, bovine colostrum, clarithromycin, diclazuril,&#xD;
             foscarnet, oral ganciclovir, GM-CSF, G-CSF, hypericin, IL-2, interferon-beta,&#xD;
             interferon-gamma, itraconazole, liposomal amphotericin, liposomal gentamicin,&#xD;
             nimodipine, PEG-IL2 (polyethylene glycosylated IL-2), roxithromycin, spiramycin,&#xD;
             trimetrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AIDS or Advanced ARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients eligible to enter this protocol must fall into one of the following three&#xD;
             categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AZT treatment failure or AZT intolerance or AZT ineligibility or Rollover Patients&#xD;
             Under 18 years of age must have the consent of a parent or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of peripheral neuropathy due to any cause, even if peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
             was not the reason for discontinuation of other anti-HIV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding suggestive of peripheral neuropathy found at baseline neurological exam.&#xD;
             If a patient has an isolated finding of an absent achilles reflex he may be entered if&#xD;
             no signs or symptoms and no other findings are suggestive of peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment with excluded medications. Excluded medications include any&#xD;
             other experimental drugs (including ddI), drugs with known nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic&#xD;
             potential, and drugs likely to cause peripheral neuropathy. Any = or &gt; Grade 3&#xD;
             laboratory or clinical abnormality or any severe abnormality not listed requires&#xD;
             permission from the medical monitor to be entered into this study..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or deemed unable to sign informed consent.&#xD;
