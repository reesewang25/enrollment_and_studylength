      This study will compare the effectiveness of relatively new antidepressants which have&#xD;
      different mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Buproprion (Wellbutrin) works on dopamine and the dopaminergic pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sertraline (Zoloft) works as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venlafaxine (Effexor) works as a mixed serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will be patients diagnosed with a bipolar disorder who are&#xD;
      presently taking medication to prevent the symptoms of the disease (prophylactic treatment),&#xD;
      but have had breakthrough episodes of depression despite taking their medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive any one of the three antidepressant medications as noted above plus a&#xD;
      placebo inactive sugar pill, in order to mask which antidepressant is being prescribed) in&#xD;
      addition to their regular medication for bipolar disorder. All of the doses will be&#xD;
      calculated as effective for the treatment of a unipolar major depressive disorder. The&#xD;
      patient will continue receiving the medication for ten weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the drug treatment will be measured by using three different scales;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inventory for Depressive Symptoms - Clinicians form (IDS-C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical Global Impression scale(CGI-BP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Life Charting Methodology (LCM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not respond to their medication within ten weeks from the beginning of the&#xD;
      study will be considered as non-responders and be offered the opportunity to start the study&#xD;
      again, taking one of the two remaining medications. For example, if a patient was assigned to&#xD;
      take Wellbutrin but it was ineffective, he/she could re-enter the study and be given either&#xD;
      Zoloft or Effexor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that do respond in the first ten weeks of the study will be eligible to continue&#xD;
      taking the medication for one year to assess the long term effectiveness of the drug on&#xD;
      preventing episodes of depression and to assess for any possible differential induction of&#xD;
      mania.&#xD;

      This NIMH-Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network (the &quot;Network&quot;) study will be the first&#xD;
      systematic assessment in bipolar depression of the comparative efficacy of bupropion&#xD;
      (Wellbutrin), sertraline (Zoloft), and venlafaxine (Effexor), three newer antidepressants&#xD;
      which have very different mechanisms of action. Bupropion is largely dopaminergic while&#xD;
      sertraline is a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and venlafaxine is a mixed&#xD;
      serotonin, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Subjects&#xD;
      enrolled in this study will be bipolar patients on prophylactic treatment who experience a&#xD;
      breakthrough major depressive episode. Subjects will be assigned in a double-blind manner&#xD;
      using a three-arm forced randomization procedure to antidepressant therapy with either&#xD;
      bupropion, sertraline, or venlafaxine for a ten-week acute response trial. The study&#xD;
      medications will be assigned as adjuvant treatment to mood stabilizing medication(s) which&#xD;
      have proven unsatisfactorily effective within therapeutic range(s) or at maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose(s). All subjects will receive active drug at dosages established as clinically relevant&#xD;
      for unipolar major depressive disorder. Subjects and research personnel conducting&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal rating assessments of mood and functioning will be blinded&#xD;
      to treatment group assignment. The primary outcome measures will be the Inventory for&#xD;
      Depressive Symptoms - Clinician form (IDS-C), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI-BP) scale,&#xD;
      and the Life Charting Methodology (LCM). Subjects who worsen from baseline to week four of&#xD;
      treatment will be considered non-responders to the initially assigned medication, and will be&#xD;
      offered re-randomization to either of the two drugs to which the subject was not originally&#xD;
      randomized (e.g., for bupropion non-response, to either sertraline or venlafaxine) for an&#xD;
      additional ten-week acute response trial. Responders to the acute trial enter a 12 month&#xD;
      trial of continuation therapy to assess long term effects on prophylaxis of depression and&#xD;
      possible induction of mania or cycle acceleration. We also wish to explore possible clinical&#xD;
      and biological correlates of acute and long term response to these antidepressants which have&#xD;
      received almost no systematic study in bipolar illness. One hypothesis of this study is that&#xD;
      the acute efficacy for the three antidepressants would be the same. Another hypothesis is&#xD;
      that because of the potent noradrenergic (NE) effects, venlafaxine would have a higher rate&#xD;
      of inducing mania compared with bupropion or sertraline.&#xD;
