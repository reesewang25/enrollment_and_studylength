      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phenobarbital Prophylaxis for Neonatal Intracranial Hemorrhage Study was a clinical trial&#xD;
      supported by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke&#xD;
      (NINCDS), and enrolled 280 infants at three Harvard Neonatal Intensive Care Units between&#xD;
      June 1981 and April 1984. Babies were recruited for the study if their birth weights were&#xD;
      1,750 grams or less, they had no demonstrable intraventricular hemorrhage by cranial&#xD;
      ultrasound and they required intubation within the first twelve hours of life. Data collected&#xD;
      included maternal history, infant health status, and events of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Antenatal Risk Factors for Intraventricular Hemorrhage Study, also funded by NINCDS, was&#xD;
      composed of 520 infants, at or less than 1,500 grams birth weight who were born at two&#xD;
      Harvard teaching hospitals between July 1984 and September 1986. Babies were enrolled if they&#xD;
      were alive when their mothers were interviewed, usually 24-48 hours after delivery.&#xD;
      Procedures in the delivery room and findings on early examinations were recorded. Information&#xD;
      about the first five days of life was collected daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic pulmonary disease of prematurity is a substantial&#xD;
      long-term problem in survivors of neonatal intensive care. This disorder is seen in 15 to 35&#xD;
      percent of surviving infants whose birth weight was less than 1,500 grams. It is estimated&#xD;
      that 5 percent of all neonatal intensive care unit admissions develop the affliction.&#xD;
      Affected infants require prolonged neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study was begun in 1988, infants with BPD who survived to NICU discharge required&#xD;
      home oxygen therapy for months to years. In addition, they had a 50-69 percent chance of&#xD;
      re-hospitalization and an 11-36 percent probability of death in the first year of life.&#xD;
      Although improvement with age was often seen, pulmonary function abnormalities persisted into&#xD;
      late childhood or beyond in at least 75 percent. Among other associated morbid sequelae were&#xD;
      myocardial and pulmonary vascular dysfunction, cor pulmonale, systemic hypertension, growth&#xD;
      failure, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Pathologic studies showed structural pulmonary&#xD;
      and myocardial abnormalities in the most severely affected infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of advances in the field of neonatology, one of the most exciting was the experimental use of&#xD;
      exogenous surfactant. Neonatal clinicians and researchers looked to these preparations for&#xD;
      specific therapy for hyaline membrane disease and indirect reduction of neonatal mortality&#xD;
      and chronic pulmonary disease of prematurity. Published clinical studies of exogenous&#xD;
      surfactant were supportive of the anticipated trends in neonatal mortality and morbidity. Up&#xD;
      to 1988, however, surfactant therapy was shown to have a more appreciable impact on acute&#xD;
      respiratory disease and neonatal mortality than on the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, published trials reported that even surfactant-treated premature infants&#xD;
      developed fatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design was that of a retrospective, case-control study. The populations of babies studied&#xD;
      in the Phenobarbital Study and the Antenatal Risk Factor Study were not identical and&#xD;
      therefore, were not combined for analysis but allowed hypotheses generated in one sample to&#xD;
      be tested in the other. In a review of medical records, cases were chosen based on the&#xD;
      clinical criterion of a requirement for supplemental oxygen for 28 days or more. An&#xD;
      additional requirement for case status was the presence of classical stages II, III, or IV&#xD;
      radiographic findings of bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic pulmonary disease of prematurity.&#xD;
      Positive readings by two independent pediatric radiologists were required for case&#xD;
      assignment. Control infants were those who failed to meet case criteria. Hypothesis testing&#xD;
      proceeded from univariate to stratified analyses and, finally, to multivariate modeling.&#xD;
      Candidates for multivariate analysis included: antenatal factors such as maternal age, race,&#xD;
      marital status, obstetric history and pregnancy history; perinatal factors such as birth&#xD;
      weight, gestational age, degree of illness; neonatal factors such as respiratory condition,&#xD;
      body fluids, and miscellaneous laboratory data.&#xD;
