  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections are often life-threatening in persons with immunocompromise.&#xD;
      Persons with prolonged neutropenia secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapies are at high risk for&#xD;
      these infections. Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, receiving prolonged&#xD;
      corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapies, and persons with HIV infection and AIDS&#xD;
      are also at risk. With the use of currently approved antifungal therapy, many of these&#xD;
      infections may still be associated with a high mortality. Amphotericin B in its conventional&#xD;
      form, is the current standard treatment for most life-threatening fungal infections. Because&#xD;
      of its nephrotoxicity and other adverse effects, alternatives to conventional amphotericin B&#xD;
      have been sought. Alternated agents include three lipid formulations of amphotericin B,&#xD;
      fluconazole, itraconazole. Although all of these agents are associated with a decrease in&#xD;
      adverse effects, their efficacy in most life-threatening fungal infections has not been shown&#xD;
      to be equivalent to conventional amphotericin B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole is an investigational antifungal drug currently being brought to phase III&#xD;
      trials in the US. This azole has been shown active against many fungal pathogens in vitro. In&#xD;
      animal models and early human trials this new agent has been shown to be effective against&#xD;
      aspergillosis. It has been shown to be well-tolerated and is available in an intravenous and&#xD;
      oral formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-comparative, open label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and toleration&#xD;
      of voriconazole in the treatment of invasive fungal infections. This agent will be used as&#xD;
      primary therapy in those fungal infections in which no antifungal agent is currently approved&#xD;
      or in patients unable to tolerate the approved agent. Voriconazole will also be used as a&#xD;
      secondary treatment in those patients who have failed therapy with the primary approved agent&#xD;
      or are unable to tolerate that agent or have unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Males or (non-pregnant) females must be at least 18 Years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have one of the following systemic or invasive fungal infections at baseline:&#xD;
        (1) systemic or invasive infection due to a fungal pathogen for which there is no currently&#xD;
        licensed treatment; (2) systemic or invasive fungal infection, with evidence of failure&#xD;
        and/or intolerance/toxicity to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents.&#xD;
        Definition of failure to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents: a) for&#xD;
        invasive aspergillosis and other invasive fungal infections: lack of clinical response&#xD;
        after at least 7 days of systemic antifungal treatment at adequate doses; or b) for Candida&#xD;
        esophagitis only: lack of clinical response after at least 14 days of fluconazole at a dose&#xD;
        of greater than or equal to 200 mg/day. Definition of intolerance/toxicity to treatment&#xD;
        with approved systemic antifungal agents: a) intolerance to the infusion-related toxicities&#xD;
        of amphotericin B preparations despite appropriate supportive therapy; b) nephrotoxicity&#xD;
        defined as a serum creatinine that had increased by greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl&#xD;
        while receiving amphotericin B therapy or c) preexisting renal impairment defined as a&#xD;
        serum creatinine that increased to greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl due to reasons other&#xD;
        than amphotericin B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The systemic or invasive fungal infection must be present at baseline and documented within&#xD;
        four weeks preceding study entry as follows: (1) positive histopathology with evidence of&#xD;
        tissue invasion by fungal elements, or (2) positive serology where diagnostic (CSF&#xD;
        cryptococcal antigen; serum or CSF Coccidioides antibody; serum, CSF or urine Histoplasma&#xD;
        antigen), or (3) positive mycologic culture from a normally sterile site, taken during the&#xD;
        current episode of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of child bearing potential (or less than 2 years post-menopausal) must have a&#xD;
        negative serum pregnancy test at baseline, and must agree to use barrier methods of&#xD;
        contraception during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical history must be obtained at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Signed written informed consent must be obtained at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have previously participated in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not be taking and are unable to discontinue the following drugs at least 24&#xD;
        hours prior to randomization: terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, and sulphonylureas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have received any of the following drugs within 14 days prior to&#xD;
        randomization: rifampin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates as these are potent inducers of&#xD;
        hepatic enzymes and will result in undetectable levels of voriconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have the following abnormalities of liver function tests (LFT's): AST,&#xD;
        ALT greater than 5 times upper limit normal; alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin greater&#xD;
        than 5 times upper limit normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have a serum creatinine greater than 3.5 mg/dl or end-stage renal disease&#xD;
        requiring chronic dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, zygomycoses,&#xD;
        candiduria, and/or catheter- or device-related candidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have fungal infections which are not considered to be invasive or&#xD;
        systemic including dermatophytosis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not be receiving or are likely to receive any investigational drug (any&#xD;
        unlicensed new chemical entity), except one of the following classes of medications: Cancer&#xD;
        chemotherapeutic agents, antiretrovirals, therapies for HIV/AIDS-related opportunistic&#xD;
        infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not be receiving or are likely to receive the following medications or&#xD;
        treatments during the study period: G-CSF or GM-CSF (for other than treatment of&#xD;
        granulocytopenia), any systemic antifungal medication or white blood cell transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have a history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to azole antifungal&#xD;
        agents including miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have a life expectancy of less than 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could&#xD;
        affect subject safety, preclude evaluation of response, or render it unlikely that the&#xD;
        contemplated course of therapy can be completed.&#xD;
