  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune cells attack the&#xD;
      insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Several environmental and genetic factors may&#xD;
      predispose individuals to developing this disease, including changes in a gene called CD152.&#xD;
      This study will examine how this gene may influence the development of insulin-dependent&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus enrolled in clinical trials at the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health and at the University of Florida and healthy normal volunteers may participate in&#xD;
      this study. Participants will have up to three blood samples drawn over a period of less than&#xD;
      1 year. The first sample (about 20 milliliters, or 4 teaspoons), will be examined for changes&#xD;
      in the structure of the CD152 gene. If the CD152 structure is different from that normally&#xD;
      seen in the general population, a second sample (about 90 ml, or 6 tablespoons of blood) will&#xD;
      be drawn. This sample will be used to study the function of specialized immune system cells&#xD;
      (T cells), including their growth and survival, chemicals they produce when stimulated, and&#xD;
      other factors. If these cells function differently from what is generally seen in the&#xD;
      population, a third sample (90 ml) will be drawn for more detailed studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation may help explain what makes certain individuals susceptible to Type 1&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and may contribute to the development of improved treatments for the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Genetic variations in CD152 have been reported to confer susceptibility to the development of&#xD;
      type-1-diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In this protocol we will draw blood samples from patients&#xD;
      and normal control volunteers in order to analyze for the presence of CD152 genetic&#xD;
      variations and to determine whether those variations are associated with measurable&#xD;
      abnormalities in T cell function. Subjects with T1DM and homozygous CD152 gene polymorphisms,&#xD;
      patients with T1DM but without CD152 polymorphisms, and control subjects with or without&#xD;
      CD152 polymorphisms will be studied to determine whether the CD152 polymorphisms have&#xD;
      measurable effects on T cell function and signaling. We will assess T cell function by&#xD;
      measuring: proliferation, viability, apoptosis, cytokine production and T cell signal&#xD;
      transduction. The identification and characterization of genes that are linked to T1DM may&#xD;
      provide an explanation into the mechanisms by which individuals are predisposed to T1DM.&#xD;
