  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1997, the Genetics Department of the NCI Medicine Branch helped establish a breast cancer&#xD;
      genetics program at the National Naval Medical Center s Breast Care Center. Genetic&#xD;
      education, counseling, and germline testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2, two genes which confer&#xD;
      increased lifetime risks for breast and ovarian cancer, were offered under a Navy&#xD;
      IRB-approved study. Sixty participants received education and counseling on that protocol, 49&#xD;
      of whom chose to have genetic testing. The education and counseling, provided by oncology&#xD;
      nurses trained in cancer genetics, focused on preparing participants to make well-informed&#xD;
      decisions about testing. Included were information on cancer and genetics; hereditary&#xD;
      breast/ovarian cancer syndrome; risks, benefits and limitations of BRCA1/BRCA2 testing; and&#xD;
      screening and risk reduction options for high-risk individuals. Through our experience with&#xD;
      this study, we devised two different methods of providing this information. Both of these&#xD;
      methods were well received and appear to be equally effective, as measured by knowledge&#xD;
      assessments before and after the sessions and subjective evaluation by the participants. We&#xD;
      will now study them in a randomized fashion in the current protocol, to better evaluate&#xD;
      whether one method is preferable. Ultimately we hope to be able to make recommendations that&#xD;
      will allow for access to genetic education and counseling for more individuals in a more cost&#xD;
      efficient manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In October 1995 the National Naval Medical Center opened the only Department of Defense&#xD;
      funded Breast Care Center (BCC). Within less than one year the Center was seeing 100 - 200&#xD;
      new patients per week and making 10 - 20 new diagnoses of breast cancer per month. In 1997 we&#xD;
      began conducting germline testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 under an approved Navy IRB study. To&#xD;
      date, 51 individuals have enrolled into the Education and Counseling component, and 42&#xD;
      individuals have elected to receive germline testing. Early on it became apparent that a more&#xD;
      time efficient approach to education and counseling would be required if access to&#xD;
      information on breast cancer genetics was to be made available to a larger population.&#xD;
      Traditionally, education and counseling has been offered on a one to one basis prior to&#xD;
      germline testing. Often, hours are spent with an individual. At some centers, multiple visits&#xD;
      are standard. Not only is there a shortage of health care providers trained in cancer&#xD;
      genetics, but even if there were an abundance of trained providers, the time and cost, as&#xD;
      well as need for efficiency would preclude this type of approach. Thus, this approach is not&#xD;
      applicable to most health care delivery systems. We began offering education in small groups&#xD;
      approximately 18 months ago, using the same informational content that we use in our one to&#xD;
      one sessions. Based on preliminary, nonrandomized results, there appeared to be no difference&#xD;
      in learning and general patient satisfaction based on results of pre- and post-test&#xD;
      administered before and after the education. It was our contention that group education is&#xD;
      equivalent, and in some situations better than individual education. Therefore, we will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized trial designed to test equivalence between individual and group&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
