      This study will follow patients with salivary gland dysfunction to identify the long-term&#xD;
      course of this disorder and its effects on the mouth, oral function, and overall health.&#xD;
      Saliva is important in maintaining oral health and comfort. It moistens the mouth, lubricates&#xD;
      food for easier swallowing, provides enzymes needed to begin the digestive process and&#xD;
      promotes repair and cleansing of soft tissues of the mouth. Decreased salivary production or&#xD;
      changes in salivary composition may affect oral and systemic health and cause an increase in&#xD;
      tooth decay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 4 years of age and older with dry mouth symptoms and a diagnosis of primary,&#xD;
      secondary or incomplete Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome or salivary gland dysfunction due&#xD;
      to radiation may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a complete&#xD;
      medical and dental history and blood and saliva tests. Some patients will have a biopsy of&#xD;
      the minor salivary glands, usually from the lower lip, to confirm or rule out the diagnosis&#xD;
      of Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and determine the extent of changes in the salivary&#xD;
      glands. (A biopsy is the surgical removal of a small piece of tissue for laboratory&#xD;
      examination.) The ability to taste and smell may also be evaluated, and patients may have an&#xD;
      ultrasound examination of their swallowing function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a general oral examination of the teeth and soft tissues of the mouth,&#xD;
      general physical examination, eye examination and blood tests and will fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire on oral health and function. In addition, they will have the following tests&#xD;
      and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of possible fungal infection Patients rinse their mouth with 2 teaspoons&#xD;
           of a salt-water solution and spit it in a sterile container for laboratory examination.&#xD;
           If a fungal infection is detected, treatment will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unstimulated salivary function assessment Saliva production is measured by collecting&#xD;
           saliva samples through small suction cups connected to collection tubes over the&#xD;
           salivary gland ducts in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulated salivary function assessment A sour-tasting liquid (2% citric acid) is&#xD;
           applied to the top and sides of the tongue at 30-second intervals to stimulation saliva&#xD;
           production while saliva is collected using the procedure described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of markers of precancerous lesions The salivary gland biopsy done at the&#xD;
           screening evaluation (or from outside sources) is examined for markers of precancerous&#xD;
           lesions, as about 5 percent of patients with Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren's syndrome develop a&#xD;
           tumor called Non-Hodgkin s lymphoma. In some cases, the minor salivary glands may be&#xD;
           re-biopsied a few years after the screening biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed once a year with a comprehensive history and physical examination,&#xD;
      eye examination, full oral examination, salivary function assessment and questionnaires about&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of salivary gland dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Saliva plays a major role in maintaining oral health and comfort. Saliva is needed to moisten&#xD;
      the mouth, to lubricate food for easier swallowing, to protect oral hard and soft tissues, to&#xD;
      modulate oral microbial populations, to provide enzymes necessary to begin food breakdown for&#xD;
      digestion, and to promote soft tissue repair and oral cleansing. Therefore, salivary&#xD;
      dysfunction may result in numerous clinical conditions affecting oral and systemic health,&#xD;
      comfort and quality of life. In particular, we will focus on individuals with&#xD;
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren's syndrome, an autoimmune exocrinopathy that primarily affects the&#xD;
      salivary and lacrimal glands. A number of unanswered questions remain concerning salivary&#xD;
      involvement in this disorder. These include the rate of progression of secretory dysfunction,&#xD;
      and related oral and systemic complications associated with xerostomia in autoimmune and&#xD;
      non-autoimmune diseases, and B-cell dysregulation. Also, more precise estimates of the&#xD;
      incidence of the lymphoma development are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is :1) to allow careful follow-up of patients with defined salivary&#xD;
      gland alterations so that the long term course and effects of Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren's&#xD;
      syndrome (SS) on the oral cavity and systemic health in SS may be delineated; 2) to follow&#xD;
      the development and progression of B-cell dysregulation in SS; 3) to follow subjects to&#xD;
      establish whether those initially manifesting incomplete criteria for SS progress toward&#xD;
      fully meeting the criteria.; 4) to refine diagnostic tests for SS, and to determine whether&#xD;
      those subjects who meet the criteria for SS continue to do so; and 5) to develop intermediary&#xD;
      outcome measures for SS based on long term outcomes (loss of tears and loss of stimulated&#xD;
      salivary flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return every two years from the baseline visit for a full oral examination,&#xD;
      salivary function assessment, clinical laboratory studies, and questionnaires concerning&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of salivary gland dysfunction. These individuals will be patients with&#xD;
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren's syndrome (SS), incomplete SS (patients who have some, but not all of&#xD;
      the criteria for SS) or radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction. We anticipate that&#xD;
      many of these patients will also participate in therapeutic trials conducted within the&#xD;
      branch.&#xD;
