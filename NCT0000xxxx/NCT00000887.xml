  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving nelfinavir (NFV) plus zidovudine (ZDV) plus&#xD;
      lamivudine (3TC) to HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies is safe. This study will&#xD;
      also look at how long these drugs stay in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ZDV has been given to mothers in the past to reduce the chances of passing HIV on to their&#xD;
      babies. However, better treatments are needed to further reduce these chances and to better&#xD;
      suit the treatment needs of mothers and their children. Taking a combination of anti-HIV&#xD;
      drugs during pregnancy may be an answer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the dramatic reduction of perinatal HIV transmission by the administration of ZDV to&#xD;
      mother and infant, new and more potent strategies are needed to further reduce perinatal&#xD;
      transmission and better suit the diverse treatment needs of these patients. Initiation of&#xD;
      triple antiretroviral combinations during gestation, particularly combinations that include&#xD;
      drugs that cross the placenta such as 3TC, may be the most effective in reducing maternal&#xD;
      virus load to its lowest levels prior to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women receive nelfinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV antepartum (Study Day 0 until onset of active&#xD;
      labor) through postpartum (after cord clamped to 12 weeks). [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/28/97: If&#xD;
      patient presents in active labor with less than 1 hour to delivery time, the institutional&#xD;
      protocol for ZDV infusion during labor should be followed.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/26/99: For&#xD;
      maternal dosing, one Combivir tablet bid can be substituted for the individual formulation of&#xD;
      3TC and ZDV. For mothers who receive Combivir during the antepartum period, Combivir is held&#xD;
      during labor and delivery, and the separate formulations of ZDV and 3TC are used. Patients&#xD;
      who prematurely discontinue study treatment should continue to be followed on study for the&#xD;
      duration of the study.] Full pharmacokinetic sampling is performed 10 to 15 days after start&#xD;
      of therapy [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/7/00: 10 to 15 days after study entry for women currently&#xD;
      taking nelfinavir] and again 5 to 6 weeks after delivery. A maternal blood sample and cord&#xD;
      blood sample is collected at birth for analysis of nelfinavir concentrations. Maternal HIV&#xD;
      RNA in plasma is monitored throughout the study. Cervicovaginal secretions are collected at&#xD;
      entry, late gestation, and postpartum to assess the presence of HIV. A single&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics sample is collected with each cervicovaginal secretion. Serial CD4/CD8&#xD;
      activation markers are measured in women during gestation and postpartum. Infants receive&#xD;
      nelfinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV beginning approximately 12 hours following birth and continuing&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. After birth, several blood samples are collected from the infant for&#xD;
      determination of washout kinetics of nelfinavir. Full pharmacokinetics sampling is performed&#xD;
      5 to 8 days post birth and 5 to 6 weeks following multiple doses. Pharmacokinetic samples are&#xD;
      analyzed on the first six mother-infant pairs and dosing may be adjusted accordingly for the&#xD;
      next cohort. Agouron has agreed to make nelfinavir available to all interested study&#xD;
      participants for a period of 6 months after the study via the patient assistance program.&#xD;
