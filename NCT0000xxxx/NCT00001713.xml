  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute deep venous thrombosis (ADVT) of the lower extremity is a common disorder. Traditional&#xD;
      treatment with anticoagulation therapy is effective in reducing the associated risk of&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism, but is ineffective in restoring patency of the venous system of the lower&#xD;
      extremity. While systemic thrombolytic therapy has been shown to be more effective than&#xD;
      anticoagulation, catheter directed local thrombolytic therapy is the most effective treatment&#xD;
      in restoring venous patency. Current treatment regimens are based on use of urokinase,&#xD;
      infused continuously through catheters imbedded into the thrombus. These treatment regimens&#xD;
      require doses on the order of 10,000,000 units of urokinase, resulting in significant&#xD;
      bleeding complications and prohibitive costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experience at NIH with pulse-spray treatment of axillary subclavian venous thrombosis with&#xD;
      rtPA indicates that this is a highly effective and safe alternative thrombolytic regimen. The&#xD;
      proposed protocol is designed to evaluate the efficiency, safety, and doses of rtPA&#xD;
      associated with pulse spray directed rtPA treatment of the more extensive venous thrombosis&#xD;
      encountered in the lower extremity.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be 18 years or older. A negative pregnancy test is required for all female&#xD;
        patients of child-bearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients with first onset acute DVT will be accepted. Acute DVT-LE must be documented&#xD;
        by ultrasonography or venogram and will be defined as thrombosis of a major deep vein&#xD;
        segment above the popliteal vein less than 14 days since onset of symptoms or diagnosis.&#xD;
        Extension of thrombosis from the popliteal vein into calf veins is acceptable, but isolated&#xD;
        calf vein thrombosis will not be treated under this protocol, as the benefits of&#xD;
        thrombolytic therapy do not outweigh the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current familial or acquired bleeding diathesis not attributable to heparin (prothrombin&#xD;
        time greater than 15 s, a PTT greater than 36 s, fibrinogen less than 150 mg/dL); platelet&#xD;
        count less than 50,000/gL unsupportable with platelet transfusions; creatinine greater than&#xD;
        2 mg/dL; severe hypertension (systolic greater than 200 mm Hg, or diastolic greater than&#xD;
        100 mm Hg); atrial fibrillation; known right-to-left shunts; pregnancy; breast feeding;&#xD;
        history of anaphylactic reactions to contrast media; history or evidence of heparin-induced&#xD;
        thrombocytopenia. Patients with underlying coagulopathy must be evaluated and cleared by&#xD;
        Dr. Horne or a consulting NIH hematologist before they can be accepted for the treatment&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following within the previous 2 weeks: gastrointestinal hemorrhage, active&#xD;
        peptic ulcer disease, hemoptysis, genitourinary tract hemorrhage (except microscopic&#xD;
        hematuria), major surgery, trauma, or biopsy of a non-compressible site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following within the previous 2 months: cerebrovascular accident or hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with hematocrits less than 30 percent or hemoglobin's less than 19 g/dl, based on&#xD;
        Clinical Center testing will not be asked to participate in the Thrombolytic Enzyme Kinetic&#xD;
        Study.&#xD;
