  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diseases of mineral metabolism such as familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (FMEN1),&#xD;
      familial hypocaliuric hypercalcemia (FHH), familial hyperparathyroidism (FH), and&#xD;
      pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) are known as hereditary abnormalities. Meaning these&#xD;
      conditions are passed from parents to their children through genes. These specific conditions&#xD;
      result in abnormal levels of calcium in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to help researchers understand more about the genes that are&#xD;
      responsible for these disorders. By learning more about the genetic process involved in&#xD;
      hereditary abnormalities, new tests and treatments can be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects for this study will be members of families that have had relatives diagnosed with a&#xD;
      disease of mineral metabolism. Participants will be asked to give blood samples for DNA&#xD;
      extraction. DNA is the part of cells that carries genetic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA will be analyzed and the results given to the subjects. Genetic counseling will be&#xD;
      provided to subjects to aid in interpreting their results....&#xD;

      Familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), familial hypocalciuric (or familial&#xD;
      benign) hypercalcemia (FHH), hyperparathyroidism - jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT), other causes&#xD;
      of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP), and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) are&#xD;
      disorders of metabolism that are generally inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. MEN1&#xD;
      is characterized by overgrowth and hyperfunction of the parathyroids, anterior pituitary and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endocrine tissue. MEN1, p15, p18, p21, and p27 are identified genes for&#xD;
      MEN1- like states. FHH is characterized by a usually benign syndrome sometimes mistaken for&#xD;
      typical primary hyperparathyroidism, which may result in unnecessary and unsuccessful&#xD;
      parathyroid surgery. The CASR gene for the calcium-sensing receptor of the parathyroid cell&#xD;
      is mutated in most FHH kindreds; a minority of kindreds with FHH have mutation of the GNA11&#xD;
      or AP2S1 gene. HPT-JT is a distinctive subtype of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism that&#xD;
      has combinations of parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid cancer, jaw tumor, uterus tumor, kidney&#xD;
      tumor and kidney cysts. It is caused by mutation of the CDC73/HRPT2 gene. PHP is&#xD;
      characterized by parathyroid hormone resistance, and one form is associated with mutations in&#xD;
      the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein. We are continuing to&#xD;
      collect blood and tissue samples from affected and unaffected members of kindreds with known&#xD;
      or suspected MEN1, FHH, HPT-JT, FIHP, PHP, and related disorders for the purpose of&#xD;
      geneticanalysis and gene identification. In most cases, the procurement of specimens under&#xD;
      this protocol will be at an off-site location. Samples will be processed for extraction of&#xD;
      DNA and RNA.&#xD;

    <description>Studies will be focused around forms of hereditary hypercalcemia, MEN1, FHH, HPT-JT, and FIHP as well as other disorders of mineral metabolism like PHP. In doing so, we will test the hypothesis that MEN1 and MEN1-like states develop as a result of a germ line mutation in MEN1 or a CDKI gene, define the mutations present in the affected members of MEN1 kindreds, and assess the frequency of such mutations in patients with apparently sporadic disease.</description>

               1. Patient has possible form of familial hyperparathyroidism. Or case is a&#xD;
                  clinically unaffected first degree relative of such a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
