      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereditary iron overload, or hemochromatosis, is a common inherited disorder among&#xD;
      Caucasians, with an estimated prevalence of 0.25-0.50 percent, though it is mistakenly&#xD;
      believed by many to be quite rare. The disease is insidious in onset, and many or even most&#xD;
      individuals diagnosed with this disorder are not identified until advanced organ damage is&#xD;
      present. However, in the absence of anemia, which can be caused by tissue damage from iron in&#xD;
      late stages of the disease, it is relatively easy to treat the disorder by removing the&#xD;
      excess iron through repeated phlebotomy. Evidence suggests that early diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      can prevent disease manifestations and enable normal life expectancy The discovery of the HFE&#xD;
      C282Y and H63D variants in the HLA gene region on chromosome 6 provides an opportunity for&#xD;
      early and rapid genetic identification of individuals at risk for development of hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis. Much remains to be learned about the penetrance and expression of these&#xD;
      alleles, including their relevance to the full spectrum of clinical disease. To date, the HFE&#xD;
      alleles appear predominantly associated with disease mainly in populations of Caucasian&#xD;
      descent. While 80-90 percent of Caucasian hemochromatosis patients have HFE abnormalities,&#xD;
      there are hetero- and homozygotes that do not manifest any evidence of disease, or manifest&#xD;
      disease at different ages and with different outcomes, implying the existence of other&#xD;
      genetic or environmental factors. Similarly, not all hemochromatosis patients have HFE&#xD;
      abnormalities. Other genes yet to be discovered are also likely to be involved in&#xD;
      pathogenesis of iron overload and familial hemochromatosis in non-Caucasian populations as&#xD;
      well. This project is intended to examine the genetic and environmental determinants and&#xD;
      correlates of iron overload and hereditary hemochromatosis in diverse populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increases in body iron may be due to increased absorption (hemochromatosis), increased oral&#xD;
      intake of non-therapeutic iron, unneeded iron therapy, or multiple blood transfusions in the&#xD;
      absence of bleeding. The excess iron is deposited in body tissues, and can reach toxic levels&#xD;
      leading to organ damage. The toxicity can affect most tissues and organs, but particularly&#xD;
      the liver, causing cirrhosis; the endocrine system, causing diabetes, hypogonadism, and&#xD;
      sometimes hypoparathyroidism; and the heart, causing arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload and hereditary hemochromatosis have not been as extensively studied in&#xD;
      non-Caucasian racial/ethnic groups as they have in Caucasians. The toxicity of excess iron in&#xD;
      non-Caucasians appears to be similar to that in Caucasians, but the prevalence of iron&#xD;
      overload is unknown and while a genetic contribution to that overload is suspected it has not&#xD;
      been proven in all groups. It has long been assumed that iron storage disease in populations&#xD;
      of sub-Saharan Africa is due to increased iron absorption from beer brewed in iron pots, but&#xD;
      more recent information suggests there is also a hereditary component to that accumulation of&#xD;
      iron. However, iron overload among Africans does not appear to be due to HFE abnormalities,&#xD;
      nor to other genes in the HLA region at all. Primary iron overload has been reported in&#xD;
      African Americans but it remains to be determined whether or not this is linked to HFE or&#xD;
      other genetic factors. Iron overload has been reported in Asian populations, but the&#xD;
      frequency and genetic contributions (if any) are not known. In some studies where HFE&#xD;
      variants have been found in non-Caucasians, additional genetic testing has suggested that&#xD;
      Caucasian admixture may have been involved. Hispanic-Americans appear to have a frequency of&#xD;
      iron overload similar to non-Hispanic Caucasians, although further study of the genetic and&#xD;
      environmental correlates is warranted. There has been almost no study of iron overload and&#xD;
      hereditary hemochromatosis in Native American populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemochromatosis may be suitable for detection and intervention through primary care or&#xD;
      population-based screening strategies because: 1) it is relatively common; 2) it is&#xD;
      asymptomatic in its early stages; 3) screening methods are reliable; 4) standard diagnostic&#xD;
      methods are widely available in developed countries and relatively inexpensive; 5) it is&#xD;
      easily treatable; and 6) if untreated, the subsequent burden of morbidity and mortality is&#xD;
      substantial. The feasibility and benefits of such programs remain to be assessed, however,&#xD;
      since the prevalence of the disorder and the factors related to its phenotypic expression&#xD;
      (such as the optimal age for reliable detection and effective intervention) are unknown.&#xD;
      Other questions needing to be addressed include public acceptability of screening and&#xD;
      testing; sensitivity and specificity of the screening methods, particularly in&#xD;
      non-Caucasians; optimal timing and setting of screening and testing; as well as the benefits&#xD;
      and costs and/or other burdens associated with screening and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major objective of the project is to gather information needed to develop recommendations&#xD;
      regarding possible primary care- or population-based screening for hemochromatosis.&#xD;
      Estimating the burden of preventable illness from unrecognized hemochromatosis is one of the&#xD;
      most important of these needs. Comparing the relative value and acceptability of diagnosis&#xD;
      and screening by genotype vs phenotype is also important. In particular, differences by&#xD;
      racial/ethnic group, age and other characteristics will need to be examined. Some of these&#xD;
      issues, such as appropriate thresholds for transferrin saturation screening, may be resolved&#xD;
      during the proposed study's planning phase, while others will constitute key research&#xD;
      questions to be addressed by the study itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study is a multi-center epidemiological study&#xD;
      of the prevalence and genetic and environmental determinants of iron overload and hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis in a diverse and representative primary care-based sample of men and women&#xD;
      aged 25 and older. Over 101,000 patients undergoing routine screening or testing involving a&#xD;
      blood draw were recruited from five Field Centers and screened for transferrin saturation&#xD;
      levels. Cost-effective population-based strategies for recruitment was also considered. A&#xD;
      repeat fasting transferrin saturation screen in conjunction with a serum ferritin assay was&#xD;
      used to identify potential 'case' participants with confirmed elevated transferrin saturation&#xD;
      levels and matched random 'control' participants with confirmed non-elevated transferrin&#xD;
      saturation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain data on the prevalence of genetic factors in a routine care population, a&#xD;
      random subgroup of approximately 20-40 percent of the 101,000 screenees will be genotyped for&#xD;
      known variants, such as HFE C282Y and H63D, related to iron metabolism and overload. The&#xD;
      panel of genotypes to be assayed will reflect the state of knowledge at the time this phase&#xD;
      of the study is conducted. In particular, any newly discovered variants related to iron&#xD;
      overload and hemochromatosis in non-Caucasian populations, such as for iron overload among&#xD;
      Africans, will be included. The results of the genotyping will not directly impact the&#xD;
      selection of case and control participants; case/control selection will be based only on the&#xD;
      transferrin saturation/serum ferritin screen results. It is likely that many HFE genotype&#xD;
      positive persons will have confirmed elevations of transferrin saturation and thus may get&#xD;
      selected as confirmed elevated transferrin saturation case participants. Genotype positive&#xD;
      persons with non-elevated transferrin saturation levels, who are not randomly selected as&#xD;
      controls, will constitute a third group and undergo the same intensive studies as cases and&#xD;
      controls. A random sample of the individuals being recruited to participate in the genotyping&#xD;
      subgroup will be surveyed to determine their knowledge and attitudes about, interest in, and&#xD;
      support for such screening programs. Both qualitative and quantitative measures will be&#xD;
      employed. Efforts will be made to ascertain reasons for refusal and related information from&#xD;
      those who decline participation. In addition, 2,000 primary care patients will be selected to&#xD;
      participate in a substudy comparing phenotype- versus genotype-based screening and testing&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these transferrin and random subgroup genotyping screens, a comprehensive clinical&#xD;
      examination will be conducted in the confirmed elevated transferrin saturation potential case&#xD;
      participants, the genotype-positive participants, and the confirmed non-elevated control&#xD;
      participants to assess iron stores, distinguish between primary and secondary causes of iron&#xD;
      overload and to examine the associated hepatic, endocrinologic, hematologic and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease correlates and sequelae of hemochromatosis. A detailed family and&#xD;
      medical history will be obtained. Examination participants not previously genotyped will&#xD;
      undergo genotyping, with a panel of genotypes as described above, for use in association&#xD;
      analyses. The genotype-positive participants will receive counseling on their results. The&#xD;
      examination will also include an extended ELSI assessment of issues related to genetic&#xD;
      screening and testing and diagnosis of disease. Data will be collected on the participants'&#xD;
      acceptability of genetic testing, their experience with screening, their understanding and&#xD;
      interpretation of their results, and on the impact this information is having on their own&#xD;
      lives as well as those of their family members. Specific components of the comprehensive&#xD;
      clinical examination will be determined during protocol development. Follow-up ELSI&#xD;
      assessments will examine issues such as impact of the screening program on relationships with&#xD;
      family members, and any experiences with stigmatization and discrimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A family study, using comprehensive clinical examinees as probands, will seek to identify&#xD;
      modifier genetic variants related to the expression of iron overload and hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis disorders via genome scanning and assessment of linkage. Identification of&#xD;
      new genetic variants, particularly in minorities, is also of great interest, but it is&#xD;
      possible this study will not achieve sufficient power to do so. Proposed efforts to improve&#xD;
      the power, such as combining data from other studies, will be considered. The family study&#xD;
      ELSI assessment will examine family members' experiences with the screening program, the&#xD;
      impact of this information on their lives and relationships, and any experiences with&#xD;
      stigmatization and discrimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repository of blood specimens will be established to permit additional studies of genetic&#xD;
      and environmental factors relating to iron overload. This will require careful attention to&#xD;
      the details of informed consent. For some later studies, the specimens may be anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has five Field Centers, a Coordinating Center (which will subcontract for any&#xD;
      necessary Reading Centers such as an ECG Reading Center), and a Central Laboratory (which may&#xD;
      subcontract for novel assays and/or the genome-wide scan).&#xD;
