      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was of great practical importance because asthma is a common condition (3-5&#xD;
      percent of the population) which has had a recent, unexplained rise in morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Many previous epidemiological studies focused on predictors of hospitalization for&#xD;
      people with asthma seen in the emergency room. These studies were of limited value for the&#xD;
      practicing physician who sees the vast majority of patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study should, for the first time, enable a profile to be constructed of the&#xD;
      high risk patient with asthma which includes identification of modifiable risk factors. These&#xD;
      results can be used for physician and patient education programs as well as to target medical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study developed a key piece of information needed for outpatient care of patients with&#xD;
      asthma; a profile of patients at risk for severe, potentially life-threatening exacerbations&#xD;
      of asthma. The experimental design was a prospective study of 800 patients with asthma drawn&#xD;
      from a large, pre-paid health care plan. The key advantage of this population was that all&#xD;
      the care occurred within the health plan. Characteristics identified included demographic&#xD;
      factors, socioeconomic status; patient characteristics such as tobacco use, atopy, pattern of&#xD;
      medication use, self-reporting of compliance/adherence, attitudes about asthma; historical&#xD;
      assessment of indoor air quality; characteristics of asthma such as duration of asthma, lung&#xD;
      function, and variation in asthma symptoms; and speciality of physician. The outcome measures&#xD;
      were obtained over a three year period and included all episodes of hospital-based care&#xD;
      including hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and urgency care clinic visits. Based on&#xD;
      these data, models were developed which assigned relative risk to each of the independent&#xD;
      variables. These models were validated in a subset of the population.&#xD;
