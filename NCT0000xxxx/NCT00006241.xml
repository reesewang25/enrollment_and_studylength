      RATIONALE: Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were&#xD;
      destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Treating the peripheral stem cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory to remove any existing cancer cells may improve the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of treated peripheral stem&#xD;
      cells with that of untreated stem cells in patients who have relapsed low- or&#xD;
      intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of the B-cell high density microparticles&#xD;
      (BCell-HDM) device in purging B-cells from peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) harvested from&#xD;
      patients with relapsed low or intermediate grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine&#xD;
      the recovery of T-cells and CD34+ cells in BCell-HDM processed PBSC in these patients. III.&#xD;
      Compare hematopoietic engraftment following infusion of autologous PBSC purged using the&#xD;
      BCell-HDM device versus unpurged autologous PBSC in these patients receiving high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy. IV. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse effects from this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by&#xD;
      grade of lymphoma (low vs intermediate), type of myeloablative conditioning regimen&#xD;
      (chemotherapy only vs chemotherapy/total body irradiation), and center. Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)&#xD;
      harvest over no more than 4 consecutive days. A myeloablative conditioning regimen of either&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/total body irradiation is given within 4 weeks of PBSC&#xD;
      harvest. Prior to randomization one patient at each center receives PBSC transplantation&#xD;
      using cells purged with the B-cell high density microparticle (BCell-HDM) device. Arm I:&#xD;
      Patients receive BCell-HDM treated PBSC transplantation on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive&#xD;
      untreated PBSC transplantation on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously&#xD;
      beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed on days&#xD;
      30 and 100, and then at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 115 patients (15 for prerandomization study, 50 for each&#xD;
      treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

        disease No active CNS involvement A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
        lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma&#xD;
        will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma.&#xD;
