      The purpose of this research is to study a new way to test for chromosome abnormalities.&#xD;
      Chromosomes are strands of DNA (the genetic material in the cell nucleus) that are made up of&#xD;
      genes-the units of heredity. Chromosome abnormalities are usually investigated by staining&#xD;
      the chromosomes with a dye (Giemsa stain) and examining them under a microscope. This method&#xD;
      can detect many duplications and deletions of pieces of chromosomes and is very accurate in&#xD;
      diagnosing certain abnormalities. It is not useful, however, for identifying very small&#xD;
      abnormalities. This study will evaluate the accuracy of a test method using 24 different dyes&#xD;
      for finding small chromosome abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults with various chromosome abnormalities may be eligible for this study,&#xD;
      including, for example, people with developmental delay or mental retardation, abnormal&#xD;
      growth features or growth retardation, and certain behavioral disorders. Participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the clinic over a 1- to 3-day period, depending on their symptoms. All&#xD;
      participants will be examined by a genetics specialist and will have a physical examination&#xD;
      and possibly X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      ultrasound studies and medical photography. Blood will be drawn for chromosome testing-about&#xD;
      3 tablespoons from adults and 1 to 3 teaspoons from children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the test results are available, participants will return to the clinic for follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation and review of the test findings. The genetic and medical evaluations, along with&#xD;
      their implications, will be discussed.&#xD;

      There is a range of genomic aberrations from aneuploidy down to single base pair deletions or&#xD;
      inserts. Present technology uses microscopic cytogenetics for detection of large&#xD;
      rearrangements (greater than 2 Mb) and molecular techniques for small rearrangements (less&#xD;
      than 2 Mb). There is a gap in practical diagnostic technology in that microscopic&#xD;
      cytogenetics has poor sensitivity for aberrations less than 5 Mb and the molecular techniques&#xD;
      are cumbersome for clinical use in the megabase range. In many cases it is possible to&#xD;
      determine that an aberration is present by microscopic cytogenetics but cannot be&#xD;
      characterized. We propose to use Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and supplementary FISH and&#xD;
      molecular techniques to characterize these aberrations. Subjects will be seen in OP9 for a&#xD;
      clinical genetics evaluation and phlebotomy for SKY. Confirmation of SKY results will be&#xD;
      performed by standard FISH, genomic content mapping, and other standard techniques.&#xD;

        Physical anomalies or developmental anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karyotype showing derivative chromosome abnormality that is not fully characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No abnormal parental karyotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prenatal specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Probands of all ages, genders, and ethnic origin are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The proband must have a non-mosaic abnormal G-banded chromosome analysis of good quality&#xD;
        that shows one or more derivative chromosomes whose foreign component cannot be determined&#xD;
        by standard G-banding techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The parents should also have G-banded chromosome analysis prior to eligibility for consent&#xD;
        2. If this has not been done by the referring physician, it may be done as part of the&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The proband with the abnormal karyotype should have one or more of the following features:&#xD;
        dysmorphic features; developmental delay or mental retardation; growth retardation,&#xD;
        microephaly, short stature or failure to thrive; behavioral disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        Biological parents must be willing to supply a blood specimen. If they have any of the&#xD;
        features listed above, they must attend the clinic if the proband is to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The proband must be evaluated by the NCHGR clinical genetics service by the PI, a&#xD;
        co-investigator, or his associates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mothers will be queried about potential non-paternity. If non-paternity is possible, the&#xD;
        family will need to undergo clinical paternity evaluation before they are enrolled in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
