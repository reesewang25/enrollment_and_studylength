  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and immune response to two experimental vaccines when formulated with&#xD;
      QS-21 or QS-21 plus alum. To determine whether the new preparation of QS-21 in polysorbate 80&#xD;
      is less reactogenic than the QS-21 formulation used in AVEG Protocols 016, 016A, and 016B. To&#xD;
      examine whether QS-21 is immunologically equivalent to that used in 16B. To determine if&#xD;
      QS-21, when given with low doses of antigen, induces measurable HIV-1-specific CTL activity.&#xD;
      To evaluate if the QS-21 dose-sparing effect extends to an antigen dose of 0.5 micrograms. To&#xD;
      determine if the bivalent vaccine gives responses equivalent to the monovalent product or if&#xD;
      a broadening of the HIV-1-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effective vaccine to prevent HIV-1 infection may need to generate diverse and multifaceted&#xD;
      immunologic responses. Required parts of the immune response may include: humoral antibodies,&#xD;
      which broadly neutralize non-syncytium-inducing strains of HIV-1; T cell help provided by&#xD;
      both CD4 and CD8 positive subsets; and a class I-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte response.&#xD;
      Other effector responses, such as the generation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity,&#xD;
      cytokines, chemokines, or other antiviral factors may also be critical in mounting protective&#xD;
      immunity. Given the lack of a surrogate immunologic marker, the most practical approach for&#xD;
      possible efficacy trials would be to evaluate a candidate vaccine that elicits as many of&#xD;
      these responses as possible.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Volunteers in each of 5 groups receive vaccine or placebo by intramuscular injection at&#xD;
      Months 0, 1, and 6. All patients receive one of two doses of QS-21 along with vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo and some groups receive alum as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: low-dose MN rsgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 (13 volunteers). Group 2: high-dose MN&#xD;
      rsgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 (13 volunteers). Group 3: AIDSVAX B/E (injection contains each of&#xD;
      the two vaccine components, HIV-1 MN rgp120 and A244 rgp120/HIV-1) plus QS-21 plus alum (13&#xD;
      volunteers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: high-dose MN rgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 plus alum (13 volunteers). Group 5: placebo&#xD;
      plus QS-21 (8 volunteers). Volunteers will be closely monitored after each immunization and&#xD;
      followed for a minimum of 12 months after the initial immunization.&#xD;
