      Significant subsets of military veterans have reported such health problems as headache,&#xD;
      joint pain, fatigue, and memory/concentration difficulties subsequent to their participation&#xD;
      in the Gulf War. However, the etiology remains controversial. A number of toxins have been&#xD;
      implicated as etiologic factors for GW-related health problems; however, exposure levels have&#xD;
      been difficult, if not impossible, to document retrospectively. These difficulties with&#xD;
      exposure verification have led GW researchers to de-emphasize methods typical of&#xD;
      neurotoxicological research examining exposure-symptom relationships and instead focus on&#xD;
      epidemiological approaches emphasizing identification of coherent symptom patterns.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives: 1) To investigate olfactory functioning as a possible proxy for&#xD;
      neurotoxic exposure in cohorts of deployed and non-deployed Gulf War-era veterans; and, 2) To&#xD;
      examine potential associations between olfactory functioning and neurocognitive performance&#xD;
      on measures known to be sensitive to neurotoxic sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To examine associations between olfactory functioning and&#xD;
      stress-related psychopathology, namely posttraumatic stress disorder, in Gulf War (GW)&#xD;
      veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: The aim of this proposal is to investigate olfactory functioning in cohorts&#xD;
      of deployed and non-deployed GW-era veterans. In searching for symptom patterns related to&#xD;
      neurotoxic exposure, examination of deployment status and neurocognitive dysfunction in&#xD;
      relation to a sensory measure (i.e., olfaction) sensitive to environmental toxins has the&#xD;
      potential to contribute additional confirming or disconfirming evidence of GW exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Abstract: This study is funded by the Durham ERIC's Pilot Studies Initiative and is&#xD;
      being conducted by researchers at the New Orleans, LA VAMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant subsets of military veterans have reported such health problems as headache,&#xD;
      joint pain, fatigue, and memory/concentration difficulties subsequent to their participation&#xD;
      in the Gulf War. However, the etiology remains controversial. A number of toxins have been&#xD;
      implicated as etiologic factors for GW-related health problems; however, exposure levels have&#xD;
      been difficult, if not impossible, to document retrospectively. These difficulties with&#xD;
      exposure verification have led GW researchers to de-emphasize methods typical of&#xD;
      neurotoxicological research examining exposure-symptom relationships and instead focus on&#xD;
      epidemiological approaches emphasizing identification of coherent symptom patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research builds on a Merit Review Award to Dr. Vasterling, &quot;Follow-up of&#xD;
      Psychological and Neurocognitive Gulf War Outcome: Relation to Stress,&quot; which is a&#xD;
      longitudinal, case-controlled study of psychological functioning in over 800 deployed and 250&#xD;
      nondeployed GW-era veterans. Variables currently examined include self-reported health&#xD;
      symptoms, psychological symptoms, and individual difference variables (e.g., personality&#xD;
      characteristics), stress exposure, self-reported environmental hazards exposures, and&#xD;
      objective neurocognitive data (on a subset of veterans). This pilot study extends the&#xD;
      &quot;Follow-up&quot; study by introducing a distinct set of variables related to olfactory&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design of the pilot study is case-controlled. A projected 120 male and female GW&#xD;
      veterans who were deployed to the war zone and 38 male and female military personnel&#xD;
      activated during the Gulf War will participate. Olfactory measures include olfactory&#xD;
      identification, and odor intensity and pleasantness judgments, which have been revealed by&#xD;
      factor analysis to reflect distinct olfactory components. Odors are presented using the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. A brief neurocognitive battery&#xD;
      including standardized, age-normed measures of functions sensitive to neurotoxic exposure&#xD;
      (i.e., attention, fine motor skills, executive functioning, and memory) are also&#xD;
      administered. Psychopathology and self-reported health measures are also administered as part&#xD;
      of the larger &quot;Follow-up&quot; study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To-date, 32 deployed and 12 nondeployed veterans have been enrolled in the study. Subject&#xD;
      accrual and data collection are ongoing. The sample size is currently too small to detect&#xD;
      meaningful trends. It is expected that this pilot work will generate a manuscript submitted&#xD;
      to a peer-reviewed scientific journal and development of a full-scale epidemiological grant&#xD;
      proposal.&#xD;
