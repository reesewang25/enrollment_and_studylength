      To establish the incidence, clinical spectrum, and natural history of cardiac dysautonomia as&#xD;
      defined by heart rate spectral analysis in both HIV infected and noninfected children and to&#xD;
      evaluate the value of heart rate spectral analysis for predicting dysrhythmias and sudden&#xD;
      death in infants and children born to HIV infected mothers.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The magnitude of clinical problems associated with autonomic dysfunction in children with&#xD;
      symptomatic HIV infection is great. Hemodynamic abnormalities, dysrhythmias, unexplained&#xD;
      arrest and/or sudden death are common in HIV positive children, especially when acute&#xD;
      deterioration, interventions or neurologic involvement is present. If cardiac dysautonomia is&#xD;
      predictive of adverse outcomes in HIV infected children, then a future prospective trial of&#xD;
      beta-adrenergic antagonist therapy may be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis was performed on data collected under the NHLBI-sponsored multicenter study&#xD;
      entitled 'Pediatric Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Complications of Vertically Transmitted&#xD;
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection' and abbreviated P2C2. The P2C2 study was&#xD;
      performed in a prospectively defined cohort of 150 children with HIV infection and 350&#xD;
      uninfected control children born to HIV infected women who had been followed since the first&#xD;
      month of life to provide understanding of cardiac dysautonomia in early HIV infection. In&#xD;
      addition, 198 children with symptomatic HIV infection were analyzed to provide an assessment&#xD;
      of cardiac dysautonomia in later stages of pediatric HIV infection. Heart rate spectral&#xD;
      analyses were performed on 2196 Holter monitor recordings from these patients followed at the&#xD;
      five P2C2 clinical centers to capture noninvasively the time varying contributions of the&#xD;
      sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system to the control of heart rate throughout the&#xD;
      course of a day. The spectral balance parameters and the changing response of heart rate to&#xD;
      the electrocardiogram-derived respiratory signal characterized the responsiveness of the&#xD;
      sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system at rest and during the events of a normal day.&#xD;
      Autonomic function data were electronically transmitted to the P2C2 data coordinating center&#xD;
      at the Cleveland Clinic and analyzed along with other P2C2 data (eg. infectious, immunologic,&#xD;
      growth, renal, neuroendocrine, pulmonary and cardiac) to determine their risk factor&#xD;
      potential for cardiac dysautonomia.&#xD;
