    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of a class of antidepressant medications called selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on platelet function. Platelets are small blood cells&#xD;
      that help stop bleeding after injury to a blood vessel by forming a clot, or plug, in the&#xD;
      vessel. Some medications impair platelet function, leading to increased bruising and&#xD;
      bleeding. SSRIs decrease an important platelet component called serotonin, which may cause&#xD;
      bleeding in some patients. SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine&#xD;
      (Paxil), fluvoxamine (Luvox) and citalopram (Celexa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older being treated for depression with a SSRI or the non-SSRI&#xD;
      bupropion (Wellbutrin) may be eligible for this study. Subjects will be recruited from a&#xD;
      private clinic in Washington, D.C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide a history of their current medications and past history of&#xD;
      bleeding. They will have about 4 tablespoons of blood drawn for tests to measure blood cell&#xD;
      counts and platelet function. The study takes about 1 hour. The results of the SSRI-treated&#xD;
      group and the bupropion-treated group will be analyzed and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may provide information that will help health care providers make treatment&#xD;
      decisions to minimize possible adverse effects of medications in patients with depression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate platelet function in patients during treatment with selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which are widely used antidepressant agents. SSRIs,&#xD;
      which are known to decrease platelet serotonin content, have been reported to be associated&#xD;
      with bleeding in a minority of patients and recently have been associated with an increase in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding. The purpose of this study is to better understand the potential&#xD;
      risks of bleeding associated with mild platelet dysfunction in patients using SSRIs and to&#xD;
      determine whether a global test of platelet function, as performed on the platelet function&#xD;
      analyzer-100, is able to identify the changes in platelet function associated with SSRI use.&#xD;
      Until recently, platelet function testing has utilized platelet aggregation studies which are&#xD;
      very labor-intensive and require highly skilled technicians; a newer instrument, the Platelet&#xD;
      Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100, Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL) requires much less technical&#xD;
      input to evaluate platelet function. The patients will be selected from a private clinic in&#xD;
      the Washington, DC, area and will undergo a baseline assessment (history of bleeding and/or&#xD;
      thrombosis), blood tests for routine blood counts, chemistries, and platelet function using&#xD;
      the PFA-100. The analysis will include a statistical comparison of the platelet function in&#xD;
      patients on SSRIs with those on a non-SSRI antidepressant medication (bupropion). It will&#xD;
      also include an analysis of the results of the PFA-100 compared to the results of platelet&#xD;
      aggregation. The results of the study may provide a better understanding of platelet function&#xD;
      and screening for platelet function defects in patients using SSRIs.&#xD;
