      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) has improved dramatically&#xD;
      over the last three decades. Advances in the general coronary care unit environment,&#xD;
      treatment with beta blockers, and aggressive attempts at reperfusion have all contributed to&#xD;
      a reduction in mortality from acute MI. Large randomized trials have demonstrated that&#xD;
      aggressive reperfusion strategies in conjunction with aspirin can reduce mortality in&#xD;
      patients with suspected acute MI to an average of 6.5 to 7.5 percent. However, the mortality&#xD;
      rate remains high in two particular subgroups of patients: those who do not receive&#xD;
      thrombolysis (11.5 to 13 percent) or those over 65 years who do receive thrombolytics (13.5&#xD;
      to 24 percent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, attention has turned to additional adjunctive pharmacologic treatment with agents&#xD;
      such as magnesium, nitrates, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to determine their&#xD;
      potential for reducing mortality further. Of these, magnesium appears to be particularly&#xD;
      promising. It is safe, even in the hands of physicians who have no prior experience with it&#xD;
      and it is easily administered and readily available in any hospital in the United States.&#xD;
      Further, if it has the expected benefit in the high risk groups described, it would become an&#xD;
      unusually cost-effective intervention, costing less than $2,500 per year of life saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental administration of magnesium very early after the onset of acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction is supported by abundant data indicating potential cardioprotective effects of&#xD;
      magnesium. Magnesium is considered to be &quot;nature's physiologic calcium blocker.&quot; This is&#xD;
      because it protects myocytes against calcium overload by inhibiting calcium influx which is&#xD;
      particularly important at the time of reperfusion. In experimental models of ischemia and&#xD;
      reperfusion, agents inhibiting calcium influx improved post-ischemic recovery of mechanical&#xD;
      function when given prior to or at the time of reperfusion. On the other hand, little&#xD;
      improvement in mechanical function was observed if such agents were given 15-20 minutes after&#xD;
      the onset of reperfusion. Reduced serum magnesium may also be responsible for a maladaptive&#xD;
      increase in coronary tone and an increased response to vasoconstrictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, when increased serum magnesium might be&#xD;
      beneficial, there is actually a decline in free magnesium. This comes about because of a&#xD;
      sharp rise in free fatty acids brought about by catecholamine induced lipolysis at the onset&#xD;
      of chest pain, that results in a completing of magnesium in the form of insoluble soaps.&#xD;
      Thus, although total body magnesium does not decrease, magnesium available in a free form&#xD;
      that is capable of exerting a cardioprotective effect declines. Hence, there is a strong&#xD;
      theoretical rationale for supplemental magnesium administration in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1984, at least 10 randomized control trials (RCTs) of intravenous magnesium for acute&#xD;
      MI have been reported. Several statistical models exist for pooling the data from multiple&#xD;
      RCTs in a meta-analysis and estimating the treatment effect of magnesium. It is important to&#xD;
      review the essential features of these models in order to place the RCT findings in proper&#xD;
      perspective. The fixed effects model assumes that the RCTs are sampled from a homogenous&#xD;
      group of trials. Under the homogeneity assumption, each RCT provides an estimate of the true&#xD;
      treatment effect and differences between the estimates from the various RCTs are due only to&#xD;
      experimental error (within-trial variability). The random effects model assumes the RCTs are&#xD;
      heterogeneous and that differences between their estimates of the treatment effect are due&#xD;
      both to experimental error (within-trial variability) and real differences among the trials&#xD;
      such as trial design and characteristics of the patients enrolled (between-trial&#xD;
      variability). The random effects model is generally favored since heterogeneity that cannot&#xD;
      be explained by experimental error often exists among the RCTs, and this model takes such&#xD;
      heterogeneity into account in estimation and hypothesis testing. Meta-analyses of the seven&#xD;
      RCTs published between 1984-199l provided an estimated odds ratio (OR) for mortality of&#xD;
      magnesium treated patients of 0.44 (0.27-0.71) using the fixed effects model and 0.45&#xD;
      (0.23-0.86) using the random effects model. The Leicester Intravenous Magnesium Intervention&#xD;
      Trial (LIMIT-2), published in 1992, reported a 24 percent reduction in mortality with&#xD;
      magnesium treatment (P&lt;0.04), confirming the benefit of magnesium in reducing mortality in MI&#xD;
      and inspiring many clinicians to advocate magnesium treatment programs in their coronary care&#xD;
      units. The magnesium treated patients in LIMIT-2 experienced a 25 percent lower incidence of&#xD;
      congestive heart failure in the coronary care unit, suggesting that magnesium exerts its&#xD;
      beneficial effects, at least in part, via a direct protective action on the myocardium. Given&#xD;
      the potent predictive power of left ventricular function on survival following MI one would&#xD;
      anticipate that magnesium-treated patients in LIMIT-2 would have a lower long-term mortality.&#xD;
      This hypothesis appears to have been confirmed by the recent long-term follow up report from&#xD;
      LIMIT-2 showing a 21percent lower rate of ischemic heart disease related mortality in the&#xD;
      magnesium group over a median follow up of 2.7 years. The LIMIT-2 investigators have recently&#xD;
      examined the mortality rates over a five year follow up, and continue to document the same&#xD;
      long term benefit of magnesium administered in the acute phase of infarction. The absence of&#xD;
      any loss of the mortality benefit of magnesium over the long term is consistent with a&#xD;
      significant myocardial protective effect achieved during the critical period of myocardial&#xD;
      reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of ISIS-4 seemed to contradict the results of the above studies. A total of&#xD;
      58,043 patients were enrolled in ISIS-4, 29,009 allocated to magnesium and 29,034 to control.&#xD;
      There were 2,196 deaths (7.6 percent) by 35 days in the magnesium group and 2,079 deaths (7.2&#xD;
      percent) in the control group (OR 1.06[0.99-1.13]) suggesting no mortality benefit of&#xD;
      magnesium administration and even the possibility of slight harm. The findings of ISIS-4 have&#xD;
      triggered considerable controversy over the reasons why it produced a null effect for&#xD;
      magnesium in reducing mortality in suspected acute MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When ISIS-4 is added to the preceding eight RCTs, the fixed effects model (driven heavily by&#xD;
      the large sample size of ISIS-4) indicates no beneficial effect of magnesium (OR= 1.02&#xD;
      [0.96-1.09]) while the random effects model that takes into account the heterogeneity among&#xD;
      these trials suggests that magnesium may reduce mortality (OR= 0.69[0.47-1.02]). Thus, the&#xD;
      random effects model suggests that one must search for possible sources of differences&#xD;
      between ISIS-4 and the preceding trials. Two important differences that appear to be acting&#xD;
      in concert to bias ISIS 4 towards a null effect of magnesium include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 . A low control group mortality rate. The control group mortality in ISIS-4 was only 7.2&#xD;
      percent. This was probably the result of the combination of extensive use of thrombolysis (70&#xD;
      percent of patients) and antiplatelet agents (94 percent of patients) combined with the&#xD;
      enrollment of intrinsically low-risk patients (only 28 percent were over 70 years of age, 17&#xD;
      percent had a history of a prior MI, 14 percent had clinical congestive heart failure (CHF),&#xD;
      and 2 percent had systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;100 mm Hg). Incremental mortality reducing&#xD;
      effects of magnesium are difficult to detect against a low background control mortality rate.&#xD;
      The inability of ISIS 4 to detect any overall benefit of magnesium also apply to specific&#xD;
      subgroups such as the 17,325 patients who did not receive thrombolytics. ISIS 4 had less than&#xD;
      60 percent power to detect even a 10 percent reduction observed in the 9.3 percent control&#xD;
      mortality in this subgroup. A detailed analysis relating the mortality rate in the control&#xD;
      group and the treatment effect of magnesium observed in the clinical trials published before&#xD;
      ISIS-4 shows clearly that the benefit of magnesium therapy increases as the control group&#xD;
      mortality increases. Using this relationship, it was predicted that trials with a control&#xD;
      group mortality rate of about 7 percent would show no benefit of magnesium therapy, precisely&#xD;
      the result observed in ISIS-4. Of note, the LIMIT-2 trial observed a control group mortality&#xD;
      of 10.3 percent that was reduced to 7.8 percent with magnesium. The ISIS-4 control group&#xD;
      mortality was thus below that of the magnesium treated group in LIMIT-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis is consistent with the results of the latest RCT recently reported by Shechter&#xD;
      and colleagues. They randomized 194 patients with acute MI considered unsuitable for&#xD;
      thrombolysis to control (N=98) or intravenous magnesium (N=96). In addition to the standard&#xD;
      contraindications to lytic therapy, reasons for exclusion from thrombolysis included either&#xD;
      presentation after six hours and/or age greater than 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shechter et al reported 17 deaths (17.3 percent) in the placebo group and 4 deaths (4.2&#xD;
      percent) in the magnesium group corresponding to an OR of 0.21 (0.07-0.64). Consistent with&#xD;
      the hypothesis that magnesium helps reduce mortality by a direct myocardial protective effect&#xD;
      are the data on the causes of death in this latest study. In the placebo group, 11 patients&#xD;
      died from cardiogenic shock, 2 from electromechanical dissociation, 2 from myocardial rupture&#xD;
      and 1 from cardiac arrest. In contrast, in the magnesium group 1 patient died from&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock, 1 from myocardial rupture, and 2 from electromechanical dissociation.&#xD;
      Particularly noteworthy are the findings in the subset of 77 patients over the age of 70, a&#xD;
      group expected to have a high short-term mortality from acute MI. Indeed, 10 of the 44&#xD;
      elderly patients treated with placebo died (23 percent) while only 3 of the 33 elderly&#xD;
      patients treated with magnesium died (9 percent,p=0.09). Also, in this especially high risk&#xD;
      subgroup, the incidence of congestive heart failure was reduced from 25 percent in the&#xD;
      placebo patients to 18 percent in the magnesium patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Magnesium was administered late in ISIS-4. The ISIS-4 protocol required that acute phase&#xD;
      treatments for MI, including lytic therapy, were administered prior to randomization and&#xD;
      initiation of study drug therapy (i.e. magnesium). By design, therefore, magnesium could not&#xD;
      be administered in the &quot;early&quot; lytic phase (e.g. first hour). Although the time from onset of&#xD;
      symptoms to randomization was recorded in ISIS-4, time from randomization to actual&#xD;
      administration of magnesium was NOT recorded. The median time to randomization from the onset&#xD;
      of chest pain for all patients was 8 hours; in the subset of patients who did not receive&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy (30 percent of trial patients) the median time to randomization from&#xD;
      onset of chest pain was QUITE prolonged at 12 hours.. No further details of the distribution&#xD;
      of time to randomization have been reported by the ISIS-4 investigators. In an effort to&#xD;
      answer these concerns, they conducted a retrospective survey of a 1,000 randomly selected&#xD;
      patients. This revealed that among those receiving thrombolytics only about 50 percent&#xD;
      received magnesium within the two hours following the start of thrombolytic therapy. LIMIT-2&#xD;
      randomized patients a median of 3 hours from the onset of chest pain, and in Schechter's&#xD;
      study 19 of nonthrombolytic treated patients, the average time from chest pain to initiation&#xD;
      of treatment was about seven hours in both the treatment and placebo groups (a full five&#xD;
      hours earlier than in the non thrombolized group in ISIS-4) Attempts at subgroup analyses in&#xD;
      ISIS-4 also suffer from a critical lack of precise information on the actual time of&#xD;
      administration of magnesium. Thus although no apparent benefit of magnesium was seen in the&#xD;
      23,000 patients randomized within six hours of the onset of chest pain, or among the 17,000&#xD;
      who did not receive thrombolytic therapy (including 9,000 randomized within 12 hours), since&#xD;
      most of these patients received magnesium several hours after randomization, one cannot be&#xD;
      confident that reperfusion (pharmacologically induced or spontaneous) took place in the&#xD;
      presence of a raised serum magnesium level in any subgroup. Experimental attempts aimed at&#xD;
      ameliorating cellular calcium overload have shown that calcium antagonists must be&#xD;
      administered before reperfusion or during a critical window of only a few minutes following&#xD;
      reperfusion in order to minimize contractile dysfunction. Calcium flux inhibitors, such as&#xD;
      magnesium, administered too late after reperfusion appear to be ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same observations pertain to the subset of patients alluded to by the ISIS-4&#xD;
      Investigators who were randomized within six hours of symptoms onset and had a high&#xD;
      multivariate prognosis score. In the absence of details on the timing of administration of&#xD;
      magnesium, with particular reference to the elapsed time from onset of thrombolytic therapy,&#xD;
      even in high risk subgroups, the findings of the ISIS-4 study remain compatible with the&#xD;
      hypothesis that early administration of magnesium (particularly before reperfusion occurs) is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in mortality from acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implications of these observations are that, to prevent calcium overload of reperfused&#xD;
      myocytes, a loading dose of magnesium should be administered before thrombolytic therapy and&#xD;
      during the period when spontaneous reperfusion is most likely to occur in patients not&#xD;
      receiving thrombolytics. The design of ISIS-4 did not permit these conditions to be met.&#xD;
      Further, prior studies suggest that the low risk profile that characterized the ISIS-4&#xD;
      patients would have been likely to preclude obtaining much additional benefit. The results of&#xD;
      the small trial reported by Schechter et al strongly support the view that high risk MI&#xD;
      patients benefit from early treatment with magnesium infusion. However, definitive proof&#xD;
      requires the larger sample size proposed in MAGIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a randomised, double-blind trial in 6213 patients with acute ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) who were assigned a 2 g intravenous bolus of magnesium sulphate&#xD;
      administered over 15 minutes, followed by a 17 g infusion of magnesium sulphate over 24 hours&#xD;
      (n=3113), or matching placebo (n=3100). The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality.&#xD;
      At randomisation, patients were stratified by their eligibility for reperfusion therapy. The&#xD;
      first stratum included patients who were aged 65 years or older and eligible for reperfusion&#xD;
      therapy, and the second stratum included patients of any age who were not eligible for&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. At 30 days, 475 (15.3%) patients in&#xD;
      the magnesium group and 472 (15.2%) in the placebo group had died.. No benefit or harm of&#xD;
      magnesium was observed in eight prespecified subgroup analyses of patients and in 15&#xD;
      additional exploratory subgroup analyses. After adjustment for factors shown to effect&#xD;
      mortality risk in a multivariate regression model, no benefit of magnesium was observed.&#xD;
