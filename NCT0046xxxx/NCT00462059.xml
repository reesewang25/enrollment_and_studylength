      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the effectiveness of the Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Colorado's (KPCO) Call Center's Medication Reconciliation Program and standard care in&#xD;
      regards to their impacts on emergency department (ED) and urgent care visits, inpatient&#xD;
      rehospitalizations, and adherence to preferred, formulary medications.&#xD;

      This study will be a health services evaluation. This study will be a pilot study utilizing a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial design. This study will utilize secondary data collected from&#xD;
      existing KPCO databases to assess outcomes. Interventions will occur over a one-month period.&#xD;
      The study will take approximately twelve months to conduct including the data collection and&#xD;
      analysis, results interpretation, and manuscript and report preparation. The duration of&#xD;
      intervention group subject participation will be limited to the length of the medication&#xD;
      reconciliation counseling phone call and the 3-month follow-up period while the duration of&#xD;
      control group subject participation will be limited to the 3-month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KPCO internists discharging patients on medications to ambulatory care from either the Good&#xD;
      Samaritan or St. Joseph hospitals over a four-week period will send discharge orders to the&#xD;
      CPCC via Health Connect. Project-dedicated CPCC pharmacists will utilize the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria to determine patient eligibility. Project-dedicated CPCC staff will make&#xD;
      several attempts at varying times during the 24 hours following reception of the discharge&#xD;
      note in Health Connect to conduct the telephonic consent process among eligible patients. If&#xD;
      a patient can not be contacted after several attempts, the staff member will leave a&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant message, if possible, to request either the patient or his/her caregiver call&#xD;
      the CPCC. If the subject doesn't not contact the CPCC after being left such a message, the&#xD;
      staff member will make two attempts the following day to contact the subject and/or his/her&#xD;
      caregiver. Patients consenting to participate will be categorized by hospital and, based on&#xD;
      category, randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Project-dedicated&#xD;
      pharmacists will review intervention group subjects' discharge medication orders, identify&#xD;
      discrepancies between their primary care regimen and the hospital discharge orders, and&#xD;
      collaborate with the patient's primary care physician or discharging provider to reconcile&#xD;
      any discrepancies. Project-dedicated pharmacists will make several telephonic attempts at&#xD;
      varying times during the 24 hours post-assignment to contact an intervention group subject&#xD;
      and/or his/her caregiver to execute the medication review counseling after performing the&#xD;
      medication review. If the subject can not be contacted after several attempts, the pharmacist&#xD;
      will leave a HIPAA-compliant message, if possible, to request either the subject or his/her&#xD;
      caregiver call the CPCC. If the subject doesn't not contact the CPCC in the day after being&#xD;
      left such a message, the pharmacist will make two attempts per day for two more days to&#xD;
      contact the subject and/or his/her caregiver. Assignment dates will be used as an index dates&#xD;
      from which rolling baseline and follow-up periods will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Baseline subject characteristics and&#xD;
      study outcomes for each of the cohorts will be reported as means, medians, and standard&#xD;
      deviations for interval- and ratio-level variables (e.g., age) and proportions for nominal-&#xD;
      and ordinal-level data (e.g., gender, hospital discharge diagnoses, post-discharge ED and&#xD;
      urgent care visits, IP readmission). Interval-and ratio-level variables will be assessed for&#xD;
      normality of their distributions. Appropriate parametric (e.g., independent samples t-test)&#xD;
      or non-parametric (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test) statistical tests will then be performed to&#xD;
      assess differences in mean or median values. Ordinal-level and nominal-level will be assessed&#xD;
      with the Pearson's chi-square statistical test. Logistic regression modeling will be used to&#xD;
      assess the relationships between the group and binary data (e.g., ED and urgent care visits,&#xD;
      receiving a non-preferred formulary agent) while adjusting for potential confounders (e.g.,&#xD;
      age, hospital discharge diagnosis, gender, CDS).&#xD;
