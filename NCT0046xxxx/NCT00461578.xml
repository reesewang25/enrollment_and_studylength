      In 2005-2006, a clinical trial was carried out to test safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination chlorproguanil-dapsone+artesunate (CD+A): 800 children aged 12-59 months with&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria randomly allocated to AQ+SP or CD+A were followed up&#xD;
      until day 28 after treatment. Adverse events, clinical and parasitological outcomes were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Between 2001 and 2006, as an interim strategy, Rwanda chose amodiaquine+&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP) as the first line anti-malaria treatment. Although the&#xD;
      clinical response to this combination was relatively good in 2001, since then its efficacy&#xD;
      has steadily declined: in 2002 the proportion of successful treatment (recorded at 28 days&#xD;
      and PCR-unadjusted) was 83 % (Rwagacondo et al., 2003) and in 2003 it was 74% (Karema et al.,&#xD;
      2006). Different artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs) such as&#xD;
      amodiaquine+artesunate (AQ+AS), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPPQ) and&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine (ALN) have been tested in the past few years as possible alternatives&#xD;
      to AQ+SP (Fanello et al., 2006; Karema et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorproguanil-dapsone (also known asLapDap) is an antifolate combination similar to&#xD;
      sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) but for two important features: (1) it is rapidly eliminated&#xD;
      and therefore exerts less selective pressure for resistance-conferring parasite mutations&#xD;
      than does SP (Winstanley et al., 1997; Nzila et al., 2000b) and (2) it is active against the&#xD;
      SP-resistant forms of the parasite that are found in Africa (Mutabingwa et al., 2001a,b;&#xD;
      Kublin et al., 2002). Moreover, a pediatric course of treatment of LapDap is estimated to&#xD;
      cost $0.15 (Mutabingwa et al., 2001b), making it orders of magnitude less expensive than any&#xD;
      marketed antimalarial drug other than chloroquine and SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005-2006, a clinical trial was carried out to test safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination chlorproguanil-dapsone+artesunate (CD+A): 800 children aged 12-59 months with&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria randomly allocated to AQ+SP or CD+A were followed up&#xD;
      until day 28 after treatment. Adverse events, clinical and parasitological outcomes were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of all trials carried out by the NMCP, The Rwandan Ministry of Health&#xD;
      has now changed the first line to artemether-lumefantrine (ALN), Coartem®. The drug arrived&#xD;
      in the country in October 2006.&#xD;
