  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the percent change in LDL cholesterol induced by&#xD;
      ezetimibe or simvastatin monotherapy and by co-administration of both agents in Black, White&#xD;
      and Hispanic men. Ezetimibe is a drug that blocks sterol absorption and simvastatin blocks&#xD;
      hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. The hypothesis to be tested is that Blacks are likely to be&#xD;
      more responsive to LDL lowering by ezetimibe than statins because Blacks have a low&#xD;
      production of cholesterol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Statins effectively lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels at the lowest recommended doses, and&#xD;
      subsequent doubling of the dosage results in a modest additional reduction of about ~6%. A&#xD;
      large inter-individual variability in the magnitude of the LDL-lowering response is seen in&#xD;
      patients taking statins, as revealed by data provided to the P.I. by Merck &amp; Co. Inc. Mean&#xD;
      reductions in plasma levels of LDL-C and the variation in response (SD) are provided for ~300&#xD;
      subjects taking only simvastatin, only ezetimibe or both ezetimibe and simvastatin. The&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for this inter-individual variability in lipid-lowering response is&#xD;
      not known. The effect of ethnicity on the statin-associated LDL-lowering has only been&#xD;
      examined in one study. In this study, directed attempts were made to implement the NCEP&#xD;
      guidelines for secondary prevention using statins. Fewer Blacks than Whites reached the goal&#xD;
      of treatment for plasma LDL-C levels, despite being seen more frequently in the clinic and&#xD;
      having their lipoproteins measured more often. It was proposed that this difference was due&#xD;
      to lower compliance with the drug regimen among Blacks. An alternative explanation for the&#xD;
      ethnic difference in response to therapy is that the effectiveness of statins differs between&#xD;
      ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that Blacks are likely to be more responsive to agents that inhibit&#xD;
      cholesterol absorption and less responsive to agents that interfere with cholesterol&#xD;
      synthesis. This hypothesis is also based on the results of a recent study conducted in our&#xD;
      laboratory that showed lower levels of lathosterol in Blacks than in Whites. Lathosterol is a&#xD;
      precursor of cholesterol and therefore it is a marker of de novo synthesis of the sterol. In&#xD;
      contrast, campesterol is a plant sterol and its plasma levels are assumed to be indicators of&#xD;
      sterol absorption. To directly address the study question, an intervention study that&#xD;
      compares the relative efficacy of ezetimibe and simvastatin will be carried out. In this aim&#xD;
      we will answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do Blacks, Whites and Hispanics respond differently to simvastatin and ezetimibe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do baseline levels of noncholesterol sterols and/or the campesterol:lathosterol ratios&#xD;
           predict responsiveness to cholesterol-lowering drugs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the low level of plasma lathosterol in Blacks reflect reduced rates of cholesterol&#xD;
           synthesis secondary to increased cholesterol absorption, and is the relative&#xD;
           responsiveness to the two different classes of LDL-lowering agents used in the clinical&#xD;
           trial related to the balance between cholesterol absorption and synthesis in an&#xD;
           individual?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal is to identify genetic or metabolic indices that can be used to&#xD;
      individualize cholesterol lowering therapy, allowing the most effective therapeutic regimen&#xD;
      to be selected. This is particularly important if long-term lipid lowering therapy is to be&#xD;
      used in individuals whose short-term cardiovascular risk is low since it would be&#xD;
      particularly desirable to use the most effective drugs at the lowest doses in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-period, crossover study of 26&#xD;
      weeks duration comprising a 3-day screening period; a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in&#xD;
      period; and four 6-week, double-blind treatment periods. Each individual will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of the four treatment sequences. Randomization will be stratified by race&#xD;
      (Black/White); both Black and White subjects will be allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the 4&#xD;
      treatment sequences. The Allocation schedule will be generated at Merck and Merck will&#xD;
      maintain the blinding. There are 10 required clinic visits (visit 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14),&#xD;
      and 5 telephone contacts (visit 3,6,9,12) at the mid-point of each treatment period to review&#xD;
      compliance with diet, study medications, and alcohol consumption requirements. A post-study&#xD;
      follow-up will also be conducted via telephone for serious adverse experience review (visit&#xD;
      15). Total visits will be 15 (10 clinic and 5 telephone) Each treatment period will last&#xD;
      about 6 weeks. During the screening visit, subjects will undergo a physical exam, dietary&#xD;
      assessment, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations), and provide blood (3&#xD;
      tablespoons) sample for routine chemistries (metabolic comprehensive panel), complete blood&#xD;
      count, liver function tests, thyroid test, and plasma cholesterol, triglyceride and&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol measurement by beta-estimation) levels, and a urine sample. Subjects&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria will be scheduled to return for Visit 2 to begin a two-week&#xD;
      single-blind placebo run-in phase. At Visit 3, subjects who, by pill count, miss no more than&#xD;
      two tablets of the single-blind study medication will be randomized to one of the 4 treatment&#xD;
      sequences. Subjects will take 2 pills each day. Vital signs will be performed at each visit.&#xD;
      A physical will be completed at the end of the study. Serum chemistry measurements, plasma&#xD;
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels, lipoprotein cholesterol by beta-quantitation,&#xD;
      measurement of apolipoprotein B and measurement of non-cholesterol sterols will be measured&#xD;
      at all visits (3-4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn). The analyses will be repeated in a&#xD;
      separate plasma sample if the data are inconsistent or needs verification. Circulating levels&#xD;
      of noncholesterol sterols will be measured by gas chromatography and mass-spectrometry, a&#xD;
      routine procedure in our laboratory, in the same samples. Investigators will be blinded to&#xD;
      lipid/lipoprotein values after Visit 1. Hematology and urinalysis will be performed at Visits&#xD;
      1 and 14. Dietary counseling will be provided during the study. Also, DNA will be extracted&#xD;
      from blood samples obtained during the trial to examine genes that control cholesterol&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
