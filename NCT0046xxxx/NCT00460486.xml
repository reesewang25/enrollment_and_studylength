      The objective of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of FSME-IMMUN 0.5&#xD;
      ml in two age strata (stratum A: 16 to 49 years, stratum B: &gt; 50 years), with the first and&#xD;
      second vaccinations being administered according to a rapid immunization schedule (12 ± 2&#xD;
      days apart). The third vaccination will be administered approximately 6 months after the&#xD;
      first dose.&#xD;
