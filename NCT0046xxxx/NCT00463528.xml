  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the extent of schistosomasis infections in women and&#xD;
      children, their daily activites that encumber contact with water and their knowledge and&#xD;
      attitudes towards the prevention of schistosomiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that will be explored is that women and children spent more time with&#xD;
      agricultural and household activities which bring them in contact with water and therefore&#xD;
      give them an increased risk of being infected by schistosoma. Prevention and control of&#xD;
      schistosomiasis has to be focusing on women and children.&#xD;
