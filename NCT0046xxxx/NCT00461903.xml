    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 7- to 13-month study is to determine the efficacy of 8 mg/day oral&#xD;
      perindopril to prevent the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with essential&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects approximately 50 million individuals in the United States and&#xD;
      approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. As the population ages, the prevalence of&#xD;
      hypertension is expected to increase even further unless broad and effective preventive&#xD;
      measures are implemented. Recent data from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that&#xD;
      individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing&#xD;
      hypertension. The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and risk of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) events is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors. The higher the&#xD;
      BP, the greater is the chance of myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), stroke, and&#xD;
      kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is also a major health problem and has been described as one of two&#xD;
      emerging cardiovascular epidemics at the turn of the century. It is the most frequent cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmia, affecting 5% of individuals aged &gt; 65 years, and it is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of stroke and a doubling of all-cause mortality. The loss of effective atrial&#xD;
      contraction may result in impaired cardiac performance, reduced exercise tolerance and&#xD;
      congestive heart failure. In addition, patients with atrial fibrillation often have disabling&#xD;
      palpitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perindopril (Coversyl) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy in controlling hypertension. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that ACE&#xD;
      inhibition may reduce the incidence of new-onset AF as well as AF recurrences.&#xD;
