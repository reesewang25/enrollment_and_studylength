  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL418 in subjects&#xD;
      with solid tumors. XL418 is a new chemical entity that inhibits a spectrum of targets,&#xD;
      including Akt and p70S6K, that mediate PI3 Kinase / PTEN signaling.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has a histologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic or&#xD;
             unresectable, for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are&#xD;
             no longer effective, and there are no known therapies to prolong survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has disease that is assessable by tumor marker, physical, or radiologic&#xD;
             means.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is ≥18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject's weight is ≥55 kg and ≤120 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For subjects who are to be enrolled into the expanded MTD cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. tumor tissue amenable to serial biopsy; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. additional informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject is capable of understanding the protocol and has signed the informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Sexually active subjects (male and female) must use medically acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has a normal fasting blood glucose level at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. If a subject has received more than three prior regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy,&#xD;
             more than two biological regimens, or more than 3000 cGy to areas containing&#xD;
             substantial marrow, the principal investigator (PI) and the sponsor will discuss&#xD;
             subject suitability prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject has had no other diagnosis of malignancy (unless non-melanoma skin cancer,&#xD;
             in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or a malignancy diagnosed ≥5 years ago, with no&#xD;
             evidence of disease for 5 years prior to screening for this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has received anticancer treatment (eg, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,&#xD;
             cytokines, or hormones) within 30 days (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)&#xD;
             before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has received radiation to ≥25% of his or her bone marrow within 30 days of&#xD;
             treatment with XL418.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has not recovered either to Grade ≤1 from adverse events (AEs) or to&#xD;
             within 10% of baseline values due to investigational or other agents administered more&#xD;
             than 30 days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has received another investigational agent within 30 days of the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has known brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is known to have diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject is pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The subject is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the&#xD;
             XL418 formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject has a baseline QTc interval &gt;450 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject is unwilling or unable to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully&#xD;
             with the investigator or designee.&#xD;
