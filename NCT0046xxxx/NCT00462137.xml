      This is a continuation of a study that has already been completed in the division of&#xD;
      gastroenterology (GI) looking at the effects of sleep medication zolpidem (Ambien) on&#xD;
      subjects with Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). That study looked at 16 subjects, 8 who&#xD;
      had been diagnosed with GERD and 8 who did not have GERD (IRB Control #04S.41). All subjects&#xD;
      previously had a PH probe completed in the division of GI at Thomas Jefferson University. An&#xD;
      additional 8 subjects with GERD will be recruited to obtain more data to add to the previous&#xD;
      study results. These subjects will undergo 2 sleep studies, one in which they will be given&#xD;
      Ambien and one in which they will not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of hypnotic medications for the treatment of insomnia has increased as has the&#xD;
      incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications. Nocturnal acid&#xD;
      reflux is associated with severe injuries such as narrowing of the esophagus, inflammation&#xD;
      and cancer of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Gallup survey conducted in 2000, on behalf of the American Gastroenterological Association,&#xD;
      found that 79% of respondents reported heartburn at night and 75% reported that symptoms&#xD;
      affected their sleep. The impact that hypnotic medications (sleep medications) have on&#xD;
      nocturnal reflux has not been well established. Orr et al. demonstrated that sleep arousal is&#xD;
      critical in clearing acid from the esophagus and that decreased wakefulness results in&#xD;
      prolonged esophageal acid exposure. Singh et al. showed that use of the hypnotic alprazolam,&#xD;
      increases esophageal acid exposure time, possibly by blunting arousal and thereby interfering&#xD;
      with acid clearance mechanisms. No study has examined sleep architecture and pattern (i.e.&#xD;
      polysomnography) with and without hypnotic medication use and correlated this with how long&#xD;
      the esophagus is exposed to acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal motility, gravity and salivation are three primary mechanisms by which acid is&#xD;
      removed from the esophagus. Blunting nocturnal arousal with hypnotic medications may&#xD;
      exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux or trigger it in otherwise healthy subjects, independent&#xD;
      of any effects the medication may have on lower esophageal sphincter pressure. By depressing&#xD;
      consciousness with pharmacologic agents (i.e. hypnotics, anxiolytics, antipsychotics) the&#xD;
      body's defense against esophageal acid clearance may be impaired. Primary peristalsis,&#xD;
      salivation and the warning symptoms of GERD are lost, thereby exposing the esophagus to a&#xD;
      greater number and duration of GERD events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential deleterious effects that hypnotic medications may have on nocturnal GERD has&#xD;
      important implications on understanding the impact that hypnotic medications have on GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect that zolpidem (Ambien) has on sleep&#xD;
      pattern, nocturnal GERD and symptoms.&#xD;
