  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this Phase II/III study is to demonstrate that Kamada-API, a new API&#xD;
      concentrate manufactured by Kamada Ltd., is comparable to a currently marketed API product.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, also called Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor (API) deficiency, is&#xD;
      a genetic disorder characterized by the production of an abnormal amount of AAT protein and&#xD;
      reduced circulating levels of this protein. Subjects with AAT deficiency are at increased&#xD;
      risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is believed that this is&#xD;
      the result of the chronic activity of elastase released by cells continually present in the&#xD;
      lungs in low numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double-blind comparison of Kamada API, an Alpha-1-Proteinase&#xD;
      Inhibitor with a currently marketed API product.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. &quot;At-risk&quot; alleles associated with serum AAT &lt; 11 μM including null alleles and&#xD;
             deficiency alleles. This must be documented in the subject's history or laboratory&#xD;
             tests performed at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of lung disease related to AAT deficiency, identified by at least one of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  FEV1&lt;80% predicted (post BD); or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Loss of lung function over a one year period of greater than 35ml in FEV1; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HRCT evidence of pulmonary emphysema&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For actively treated subjects, agreement to not receive any exogenous API product&#xD;
             (i.e. washout) for five weeks prior to first study infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of an effective means of contraception during the 24 weeks of study drug&#xD;
             administration (this is applicable to both sexes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects on the BAL, bronchial brushing/biopsy group must be on inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids at a stable dose two weeks prior the first Bronchoscopy and throughout&#xD;
             the dosing period up the final bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Laboratory evidence of severe IgA deficiency (from medical history or by IgA testing&#xD;
             at screening of at least 20% of lower range).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current smoker or a history of smoking within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergy to plasma proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participation in another experimental drug or device trial within the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of uncontrolled hypertension (systolic ≥180 mm Hg, and/or diastolic ≥ 110 mm&#xD;
             Hg on 3 consecutive occasions in the supine position)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pulse ≥ 120/min (prior to the 1st infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Abnormal screening or baseline laboratory measurements that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator would affect subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Current life-threatening malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Previous organ transplant recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of infection with HCV, HBV and/or HIV 1 or 2, or (at baseline) infection&#xD;
             indicated by laboratory measurements obtained at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Acute respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation which required antibiotic&#xD;
             and/or systemic steroid treatment within the past 6 weeks. Patient can be re-evaluated&#xD;
             for enrollment 6 weeks after an exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator may interfere with the&#xD;
             conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. If an adequate home health care agency cannot be established by Centric Health&#xD;
             Resources due to a potential subject's geographical location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for subjects entering into the BAL and bronchial biopsy/brushing:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. FEV1 &lt; 45% predicted (post-BD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to undergo bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Allergy to lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Exacerbation of COPD in the previous 6 weeks.&#xD;
