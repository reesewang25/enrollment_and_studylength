      Growth hormone (GH) is important for growth in childhood, but also has important effects on a&#xD;
      number of tissues throughout life. GH deficiency and GH excess (acromegaly, caused by a&#xD;
      pituitary tumour) are both cause serious abnormalities of metabolism and long-standing&#xD;
      abnormal GH status causes abnormal heart function. In both cases cardiovascular disease is a&#xD;
      leading cause of early (premature) death. In the current study we wish to investigate the&#xD;
      energy status of the heart in patients with GH excess and deficiency and compare that with&#xD;
      age-matched controls. We will perform a blood test to study metabolic parameters. We will&#xD;
      perform measurements before treatment, after normalisation of improvement of GH levels and 2&#xD;
      years after start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine cardiac and skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with GH excess&#xD;
           (=acromegaly) or GH deficiency and detect changes after normalisation of GH and IGF-1&#xD;
           levels. (IGF-I is a hormone directly influenced by GH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate muscle energy metabolism parameters to GH and IGF-1 status in the control&#xD;
           subjects and in both patient groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the prevalence of coronary artery calcifications in patients with GH excess&#xD;
           and GH deficiency and correlate this with their metabolic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate coronary artery calcifications to abdominal obesity. Patients will be&#xD;
           identified by Endocrinology physicians involved in the study in outpatients clinics or&#xD;
           Endocrine wards and they will receive standard care for their disease. Tests related to&#xD;
           endocrine hormone abnormalities will be performed as usual clinical practice. The study&#xD;
           will involve three 3-hour visits to the Oxford Research Centre and two 1-hour visits to&#xD;
           London Scanning Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits at the Oxford research centre will include Cardiac and skeletal investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard cardiac MRI will be used to measure right and left ventricular morphology and&#xD;
           global function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor heart muscle energy levels (by&#xD;
           measuring intracellular PCr and ATP in heart muscle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart failure severity (so called 'NYHA status') will be determined from the 6 min walk&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peak oxygen uptake will be estimated from a metabolic gas exchange analysis performed&#xD;
           during maximal treadmill exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skeletal muscle MR imaging and spectroscopy will be performed at rest and during&#xD;
           exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood test will be performed, see details in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire and 5 point test for sleep apnoea The visits at&#xD;
           the London Scanning Centre will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electron beam coronary CT (EBCT) to assess coronary disease. The number of coronary&#xD;
           disease lesions will be measured in several coronary arteries and values will add up to&#xD;
           an overall score. In addition a single picture will be taken at the level of the&#xD;
           umbilicus (belly button) to measure fat tissue within the abdomen. Patient selection:&#xD;
           Patients will be recruited at St. Bartholomew's Hospital (Dr P. Jenkins and Prof. A.&#xD;
           Grossman), King's Hospital (Dr S. Aylwin) and St Thomas's Hospital (Dr P. Carroll) in&#xD;
           London, Royal Free Hospital (Prof P. Boloux), the John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford (Prof&#xD;
           J. Wass), Addenbrooks Hospital Cambridge (Dr H. Simpson), Sheffield (Dr J.&#xD;
           Newell-Price), and Stroke-on-Trent (Prof R. Clayton) from the Endocrine Wards and&#xD;
           outpatient clinics. This constitutes a large recruitment base. We estimate that 45 new&#xD;
           acromegaly patients and 60-80 new GHD patients per year will be screened. Patients will&#xD;
           be selected on the basis of clinical diagnosis of acromegaly or GH deficiency (see&#xD;
           details of these in the formal protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be managed according to the clinical protocols of the referring centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have a report of their investigation results with their treating&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects will be selected from the general population via advertisements. They will&#xD;
      undergo all tests in the Oxford centre once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected value of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will increase our knowledge of the metabolic changes associated with GH excess&#xD;
      and GH deficiency, which can lead to increased cardiac morbidity and mortality in both cases.&#xD;
      Our studies will help to clarify the mechanism of abnormal cardiac function. The study has&#xD;
      been powered to have appropriate number of subjects within a two year period, therefore we&#xD;
      anticipate that it will last from start to finish 4 years.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The effect of GH and IGF-I on the heart has been demonstrated in numerous&#xD;
      experimental studies. GH and IGF-I receptors are expressed in cardiac myocytes, and IGF-I&#xD;
      causes hypertrophy of cultured rat cardiomyocytes and delays cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In&#xD;
      addition, GH and IGF-I have a direct effect on myocardial contractility, increasing the&#xD;
      intracellular calcium content and enhancing the calcium sensitivity of myofilaments in&#xD;
      cardiomyocytes. Clinical studies in patients with disorders of the GH/IGF-1 axis confirm the&#xD;
      significant relationship between GH/IGF-I and the cardiovascular system. Interestingly, both&#xD;
      GH excess and deficiency states are associated with abnormal cardiac function and with an&#xD;
      attendant increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in both. Our contention&#xD;
      is that the apparent paradox of the relationship may be due to changes in the energy state of&#xD;
      the myocardium in GH excess (acromegaly) and deficiency (GHD in hypopituitarism) and the&#xD;
      inability of cellular metabolism to change appropriately between the competing demands of&#xD;
      oxidative stress and anabolic processes. Data from the giant GH-overexpressing transgenic&#xD;
      mouse demonstrate reduced creatinine phosphate-to-ATP ratio supporting an effect of GH on&#xD;
      cardiac energy status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the energy sensor of the cell and has been shown to be&#xD;
      an important regulator of cell metabolism, including cardiac cells (Dyck &amp; Lopaschuk, 2002).&#xD;
      AMPK is activated by rising AMP/ATP ratio, and programs intracellular metabolism to conserve&#xD;
      energy for oxidate metabolism and to suspend anabolic processes. A substantial body of&#xD;
      evidence testifies to the importance of AMPK and the associated regulation of myocardial&#xD;
      energy status to cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced activity of AMPK is a feature of inherited cardiomyopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low energy status measured non-invasively is a predictor of death in dilated&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activation of AMPK reduces the injury in experimental models of ischaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced cardiac energy reserve is a feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and&#xD;
           cardiovascular death accounts for over 80% of mortality in T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drugs which are known to activate AMPK improve mortality in type 2 diabetes, such as&#xD;
           metformin and glitazones (Kahn et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cannabinoids and ghrelin, first identified by our group to increase cardiac AMPK levels,&#xD;
           have been shown to improve ischaemia-reperfusion injury (Frascarelli et al., 2003;&#xD;
           Underdown et al., 2005; Shibata et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking these experimental observations together, it can be inferred that in diabetic cardiac&#xD;
      muscle, there is impaired activation of AMPK despite low energy levels, and potentially a&#xD;
      failure of the normal mechanism to favour oxidative metabolism and cytoprotective functions&#xD;
      during ischaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients, cardiac AMPK cannot be directly studied, although in a related animal study we&#xD;
      will assess the effect of GH excess and deficiency on the activation of AMPK cardiac&#xD;
      intracellular energy status and myocardium function. However, using 31P Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (MRS), in vivo measurement of high energy phosphate molecules can be assessed&#xD;
      non-invasively and these have been shown in other diseases to have important clinical&#xD;
      consequences. Specifically, both phosphocreatine (PCr), and ATP can be determined and ADP&#xD;
      levels derived from the phosphocreatine:ATP ratio (Scheurmann-Freestone 2003). This approach&#xD;
      has been recently used to demonstrate low ambient level of myocardial ADP in patients with&#xD;
      T2DM. In the current study we will investigate the energy status in patients with acromegaly&#xD;
      and GHD before and after normalisation of their GH status. We hypothesise that in untreated&#xD;
      acromegaly, the unrestrained drive of anabolism will be associated with a low energy status,&#xD;
      and particularly in inability to respond to exercise. We propose that in GHD, reduced&#xD;
      anabolism will be associated with relatively high levels of energy but an impairment of&#xD;
      muscle mass. We further anticipate that the normalisation of hormone levels resulting from&#xD;
      either medical or surgical therapy will result in improvement in energy-storing phosphate&#xD;
      molecule ratios in the myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acromegaly - Cardiac function Acromegalic cardiomyopathy is the specific myocardial disease&#xD;
      of acromegaly (Clayton, 2003; Sacca et al., 2003; Colao et al., 2004b). Active acromegaly is&#xD;
      associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in mortality, mainly from cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      although with effective treatment the excess mortality can be reversed (Sheppard, 2005). In&#xD;
      its early stages, acromegalic cardiomyopathy is characterised by increased left ventricular&#xD;
      mass, with eccentric remodeling and normal diastolic function with a high cardiac output&#xD;
      state with reduction of systemic vascular resistance (Fazio et al., 2000). In the next stage,&#xD;
      increased heart mass and diastolic dysfunction, attributed to direct injury of the myocardium&#xD;
      with GH hypersecretion, occur in the absence of associated diseases like hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction. These abnormalities can progress to dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and heart failure if acromegaly remains untreated for many years. There are&#xD;
      specific structural changes in the myocardium with increased myocyte size and interstitial&#xD;
      fibrosis of both ventricles. Left ventricular hypertrophy is common (in 64% of newly&#xD;
      diagnosed cases) even in young patients with short duration of disease (Colao et al., 2003).&#xD;
      Functionally, the main consequence of these changes is impaired left ventricular diastolic&#xD;
      function, particularly when exercising, such that exercise tolerance is reduced (Colao et&#xD;
      al., 2002). Myocardial perfusion is impaired in patients with active acromegaly as assessed&#xD;
      by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), thus representing an early stage of&#xD;
      cardiac involvement in acromegaly that may be directly mediated by GH excess (Herrmann et&#xD;
      al., 2003). Some of these structural and functional changes can be reversed by effective&#xD;
      treatment to lower serum GH levels to less than 1-2 ng/ml (glucose suppressed or random,&#xD;
      respectively) and normalize IGF-I and long-term outcome and survival is improved (Colao et&#xD;
      al., 2002; Jaffrain-Rea et al., 2003). Diastolic function improves with treatment, but the&#xD;
      effect on exercise tolerance is more variable, and more longitudinal data are required to&#xD;
      assess the benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acromegaly - Coronary atherosclerosis Although coronary disease has a prevalence of 3-40% in&#xD;
      acromegalic patients, there is considerable controversy whether this is directly related to&#xD;
      GH excess. According to a well-controlled study (Otsuki et al., 2001) in which intima&#xD;
      thickness was measured, the extent of atherosclerosis in the acromegalic patients was not&#xD;
      higher than that in non-acromegalic subjects, and considering their increased number of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic risk factors, such as lipid abnormalities, diabetes, increased homocystein,&#xD;
      lipoprotein a, fibrinogen and platelet activator inhibitor 1 levels which are all strong&#xD;
      predictors of coronary vascular disease, GH might therefore be even protective (Matta &amp;&#xD;
      Caron, 2003). In a recently described study with 79 acromegalic patients with 22 age-matched&#xD;
      controls again no difference was observed in intima thickness (Paisley et al., 2006).&#xD;
      Increased concentration of IGF-I - via its vasodilatotary effect mediated by nitric oxide -&#xD;
      might be involved in the lack of susceptibility to atherosclerosis in some acromegalic&#xD;
      patients. There are no previously published studies using electron beam coronary CT in this&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acromegaly - Skeletal muscle It is recognised that skeletal muscle in acromegaly fatigues&#xD;
      rapidly but this has not been adequately explained, particularly in relation to the increase&#xD;
      in muscle mass. It has been suggested that this may result from associated metabolic&#xD;
      derangements (diabetes or thyroid abnormalities), or a direct effect of GH excess on muscle.&#xD;
      Increase in muscle specific creatinine kinase levels have been detected in patients with&#xD;
      active disease which improves with a reduction of serum GH (McNab &amp; Khandwala, 2005) .&#xD;
      Microscopic examination of skeletal muscle from acromegalic patients shows type 1 fibre&#xD;
      hypertrophy (Nagulesparen et al., 1976).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GHD - Cardiac function Patients with GH deficiency have an increased mortality due to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Most studies show decreases in heart function such as reduced left&#xD;
      ventricular mass and cardiac output, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      particularly during exercise; in addition there is an increased incidence of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (Colao et al., 2004a; Colao et al., 2004b; Svensson et al., 2005). The mechanism of&#xD;
      cardiac abnormalities in GHD is debated, but most data support the hypothesis that GHD leads&#xD;
      to reduced cardiac mass, reduced contractility, reduced pre-load and increased after-load,&#xD;
      all of which could lead to reduced stroke-volume and reduced cardiac output (Colao et al.,&#xD;
      2004b). Treatment with GH results in improvement in cardiac function and reduction of&#xD;
      peripheral resistance due to direct anabolic actions of the myocardium but increased&#xD;
      dimensions could also be secondary to an increased cardiac output and stroke volume as a&#xD;
      result of increased contractility and increased pre-load. In conclusion, GHD is associated&#xD;
      with cardiac dysfunction related to the degree and duration of GHD and GH replacement seems&#xD;
      to enhance ventricular mass and cardiac function and to reverse diastolic abnormalities&#xD;
      (Juul, 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GHD - Coronary sclerosis The evidence linking coronary sclerosis and GHD is robust although&#xD;
      it is unclear whether this is a direct effect of GH deficiency on cardiac endothelium, or an&#xD;
      indirect effect of the increase in cardiovascular risk factors documented in patients with&#xD;
      hypopituitarism and GH deficiency. These include increased abdominal adiposity, abnormal LDL&#xD;
      and triglyceride levels, high fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity,&#xD;
      increased markers of inflammation (such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein) and&#xD;
      consequently increased intima-thickness (Colao et al., 2004a; Colao et al., 2004b). In our&#xD;
      studies, we will use electron-beam CT (EBCT) as a non-invasive means of determining coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, which is a sensitive indicator of IHD. This will allow us to control for&#xD;
      changes in the onset and/or recovery from ischaemia that might be due to macrovascular&#xD;
      ischemia rather than reduced intracellular capacitance. There are no previously published&#xD;
      studies using electron beam coronary CT in these groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GHD - Skeletal muscle Adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) is associated with fatigue,&#xD;
      tiredness and isometric muscle strength is reduced to 76%. After 6 months of GH therapy,&#xD;
      muscle mass increases 5% (Bengtsson et al., 1993; Juul, 1996). Neuromuscular dysfunction is&#xD;
      also observed (abnormal electromyogram and interference pattern analysis) which improves&#xD;
      after initiating GH therapy (Webb et al., 2003). The reduced exercise capacity observed in&#xD;
      GHD is multifactorial but reduced skeletal muscle mass has an important contribution to it&#xD;
      (Juul, 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, existing evidence demonstrates that patients with both GH deficiency and GH&#xD;
      excess have abnormal cardiac and skeletal muscle function, although the nature of the cardiac&#xD;
      abnormality differs. In acromegaly there is hypertrophy and impaired contractility with&#xD;
      dysfunction amplified during exercise. In GHD, risk factors for IHD cause premature occlusive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, coupled with a poor anabolic stimulus and reduced muscle mass.&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle echoes these processes. . In transgenic mice overexpressing GH (an&#xD;
      acromegalic mouse) the phosphocreatine -to-ATP ratio measured by MRS is significantly lower&#xD;
      in GH overexpressing mice than controls, suggesting impaired energy level in the myocardium&#xD;
      (Bollano et al., 2000). We hypothesise that chronic growth hormone excess may lead to reduced&#xD;
      energy level within the myocardium, and that restoration of normal GH level will ameliorate&#xD;
      this abnormality. Our model would also predict that in GHD resting energy levels would be&#xD;
      normal or even high, and that the primary defect is a reduction in muscle mass due to reduced&#xD;
      anabolic stimulus. In patients with GH excess and GHD we will assess cardiac energy levels&#xD;
      with MRS, a non-invasive technique of assessing myocardial energy metabolism before and after&#xD;
      treatment, a technique that has been successfully used to establish abnormal heart energy&#xD;
      levels in patients with diabetes and heart failure (Scheuermann-Freestone et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine cardiac (at rest) and skeletal muscle (at rest, peak exercise and recovery)&#xD;
           energy metabolism in patients with GH excess and detect changes after normalisation of&#xD;
           GH and IGF-1 levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine cardiac and skeletal muscle energy metabolism in patients with GH deficiency&#xD;
           and detect changes after normalisation of IGF-1 levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate muscle energy metabolism parameters to GH and IGF-1 status in the control&#xD;
           subjects and in both patient groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the prevalence of coronary artery calcifications in patients with GH excess&#xD;
           and GH deficiency and correlate with their risk factors and other surrogate markers of&#xD;
           CHD (serum levels of high sensitivity CRP, lipoprotein (a), homocysteine, and insulin&#xD;
           resistance (HOMA analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine the anatomical distribution of the atheromatous plaques within the coronary&#xD;
           arteries and the extent of isolated plaques compared to diffuse disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Cardiac and skeletal investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI at 1.5T (Siemens Sonata) will be used to measure right and left ventricular&#xD;
           morphology and global function (Sandstede et al., 2005) (i.e. left and right ventricular&#xD;
           systolic and end-diastolic volumes and ejection fractions). Tissue phase mapping will be&#xD;
           used to measure radial and rotational tissue velocities for regional wall motion&#xD;
           abnormalities and abnormal contractile patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  31P MRS will be used as previously described (Crilley et al., 2000; Roest et al., 2001)&#xD;
           to monitor intracellular PCr and ATP in heart muscle. Acquisition will be triggered&#xD;
           using electrocardiographic gating. Cardiac diastolic function will be measured using&#xD;
           cine MRI volume-time curves and tissue phase mapping parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart failure severity (NYHA status) will be determined from the degree of dyspnoea (6&#xD;
           min walk test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peak O2 uptake (MVO2) will be estimated from a metabolic gas exchange analysis performed&#xD;
           during maximal treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skeletal muscle MR imaging and spectroscopy: The protocol for the 31P MRS determination&#xD;
           of calf muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus) metabolism at rest and during dynamic exercise&#xD;
           is well established (Scheuermann-Freestone et al., 2003). A T1-weighted MR image will be&#xD;
           used to determine the muscle cross-sectional area and 31P MRS of the gastrocnemius&#xD;
           muscle will be performed at rest, during and after exercise. Each subject will lie in&#xD;
           the 3T superconducting magnet with their calf overlying a 6 cm diameter surface coil.&#xD;
           The muscle will be exercised by plantar flexion of the right ankle, lifting a weight of&#xD;
           10% lean body mass a distance of 7 cm at a rate of 30/min. After acquisition of four&#xD;
           spectra (each 1.25 min), the weight will be incrementally increased by 2% of lean body&#xD;
           mass every other minute. The subject will exercise until stopping when fatigued and the&#xD;
           muscle will then be studied during recovery. On retesting after therapy, exercise will&#xD;
           continue again until the subject is stopped by fatigue (treatment may lengthen this&#xD;
           time). Relative concentrations of Pi, PCr and ATP will be measured from their signal&#xD;
           intensities in the spectra as described previously (Adamopoulos et al., 1999;&#xD;
           Butterworth et al., 2000; Scheuermann-Freestone et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electron beam coronary CT (EBCT) to assess coronary disease. As calcium is deposited in&#xD;
           the earliest stages of atheroma formation, EBCT can detect sub-clinical coronary disease&#xD;
           many years before it results in ischaemia. The extent of coronary artery calcification&#xD;
           reflects the overall impact of risk factors, both known and unknown, on the end organ,&#xD;
           the arterial wall, and as such gives a superior predictive value over the Framingham&#xD;
           risk assessment (Thompson &amp; Partridge, 2004; Pletcher et al., 2004). EBCT scanning will&#xD;
           be performed using a GE-IMATRON 300 scanner using a conventional protocol. Calcium&#xD;
           deposition within coronary arteries will be assessed by total volume and by the Agatson&#xD;
           correction. The number of plaques and calcium score will be measured in the left main&#xD;
           artery, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery, in&#xD;
           addition to an overall score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other investigations will include: Demographic and clinical data (incl. medication) will be&#xD;
      obtained for all patients and control subjects; ECG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire&#xD;
      and 5 point test for sleep apnoea, blood samples will be taken after a 12 h fast, after 30&#xD;
      min rest, for glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, ketone bodies, insulin, triglyceride,&#xD;
      cholesterol, HDL, LDL, ANP, BNP, noradrenalin, electrolytes, creatinine, creatinine kinase,&#xD;
      uric acid, TNF-alpha, leptin, Hb and glycosylated Hb determinations. Apoprotein A/B, High&#xD;
      sensitivity C-reactive protein, Lipoprotein (a), Homocysteine, Insulin (HOMA analysis),&#xD;
      biochemistry and liver function, pregnancy test. Endocrine investigations will include&#xD;
      Glucose tolerance tests (for acromegaly patient; for GHD if necessary), GH day-curve (a mean&#xD;
      of 5 estimations throughout the day), serum IGF-I, pituitary and peripheral hormones (LH,&#xD;
      FSH, cortisol, TFT, testo/E2, PRL), estimation of duration of the disease (the presumed&#xD;
      duration of acromegaly will be estimated by comparison of patients' photographs taken over a&#xD;
      1-3-decade span and by interviews to date the onset of acral enlargement and other clinical&#xD;
      symptoms (Damjanovic et al., 2002; Colao et al., 2003)) Patient selection: Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited at St. Bartholomew's Hospital (Dr P. Jenkins and Prof. A. Grossman), King's&#xD;
      Hospital (Dr S. Aylwin) and St Thomas's Hospital (Dr P. Carroll) in London, Royal Free&#xD;
      Hospital (Prof P. Boloux), the John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford (Prof J. Wass), Sheffield (Dr&#xD;
      J. Newell-Price), and Stroke-on-Trent (Prof R. Clayton) from the Endocrine Wards and&#xD;
      outpatient clinics. This constitutes a large recruitment base. We estimate that 45 new&#xD;
      acromegaly patients and 60-80 new GHD patients per year will be screened. Patients will be&#xD;
      selected on the basis of the clinical diagnosis of acromegaly [Acromegaly: typical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms and biochemical evidence (GH &gt; 1μg/l during OGTT, IGF-I above age-related reference&#xD;
      range); GHD: a structural hypothalamo-pituitary defect, at least one other pituitary hormone&#xD;
      deficiency, AGHDA score &gt;11 (NICE criterion) and evidence of severe biochemical GHD (usually&#xD;
      a peak GH response to an insulin or glucagon stress test of &lt;3 μg/l)]. Patients will be&#xD;
      managed according to the clinical protocols of the referring centre.&#xD;

&#xD;
      POST-TREATMENT ASSESSMENT Three months is estimated to be sufficient time to reach altered&#xD;
      (improved) cardiac metabolism as assessed by MRS based on previous studies (K. Clarke&#xD;
      manuscript submitted)). Therefore the first post-treatment assessment will be 3 months after&#xD;
      biochemical cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In acromegalic patients 3 months after documented biochemical remission (IGF-1 levels reached&#xD;
      upper limit of age-related normal range and day-curve for GH mean &lt; 2.5 mcg/l or GH &lt; 1 mcg/l&#xD;
      during OGTT) repeat MRI, MRS and biochemical investigations. If patient is not in biochemical&#xD;
      remission by 24 months, then repeat investigation at 24 months after the start of therapy&#xD;
      will be performed as the final assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In GHD patients 3 months after recorded completed dose titration (IGF-I values in the upper&#xD;
      third of the age-related normal range) repeat MRI, MRS and biochemical investigations. If&#xD;
      patient has not completed GH dose titration by 24 months, then repeat investigation at 24&#xD;
      months after the start of GH therapy anyway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 months after start of therapy repeat EBCT. There are data to suggest that for example&#xD;
      changing lipid status can improve EBCT after 12 months of therapy (Achenbach et al., 2002)&#xD;
      Age and sex matched control subjects will be recruited and studied according to the&#xD;
      pre-treatment protocol. Males and females aged 18 to 75 years willing to give informed&#xD;
      consent will be selected without endocrine or coronary disease, with further exclusion&#xD;
      criteria as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be a change in cardiac energetics, as assessed by 31P magnetic&#xD;
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (expressed as PCr/ATP ratio). Power calculations using data from&#xD;
      our cardiac 31P MRS study (Scheuermann-Freestone et al., 2003) showed a highly significant&#xD;
      reduction in cardiac PCr/ATP from 2.49 +/- 0.31 to 1.55 +/- 0.37, a difference of 0.94. In&#xD;
      order to find a biologically significant difference between groups of one standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) with 90% power at P&lt; 0.05, we would need to include 21 subjects in each group. For a&#xD;
      paired study, in which the effects of therapy were tested on the same patient, we would need&#xD;
      to include 11 patients in each group to find a significant difference between groups of 1 SD&#xD;
      with 90% power at P&lt; 0.05, while for unpaired comparison with control subjects 15 patients&#xD;
      are necessary. To allow for patient drop-outs we will include a minimum of 30 subjects in the&#xD;
      studies. Secondary endpoints for all studies will include cardiac function (MRI) and skeletal&#xD;
      muscle function and energetics (MRI and MRS, respectively).&#xD;
