  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of MVA85A in healthy volunteers in Cape Town.&#xD;
      We have shown that MVA85A is safe and immunogenic in both a mycobacterially naïve population&#xD;
      in the UK and in a more mycobacterially exposed population in The Gambia. The studies&#xD;
      described here will be to assess the safety of MVA85A in 2 groups of adults, those with and&#xD;
      without prior BCG vaccination. Once safety data has been obtained in these 2 groups, we will&#xD;
      assess the safety of MVA85A in adolescents who have been previously vaccinated with BCG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase I safety study of a single intradermal injection of 5 x 107pfu&#xD;
      MVA85A, when administered to healthy subjects with no evidence of infection with M.tb&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational and descriptive safety study, 12 subjects with evidence of prior BCG&#xD;
      vaccination and 12 adults with no evidence of prior BCG vaccination will be recruited and&#xD;
      vaccinated with MVA85A. This sample size should allow determination of the magnitude of the&#xD;
      outcome measures, especially of serious and severe adverse events rather than aiming to&#xD;
      obtain statistical significance. Once three month follow-up of these two arms of the study is&#xD;
      complete, we will recruit 12 adolescent school children (aged 12-14) and assess the safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of a single immunisation with MVA85A in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rules for progression from adult studies to adolescents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No increased incidence in local and systemic side-effects compared with trials with&#xD;
           MVA85A in Oxford and The Gambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the trials in the UK and The Gambia, all volunteers experience some mild local&#xD;
           side-effects for 1-4 days after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Approximately two- thirds of volunteers experience some mild systemic side-effects in&#xD;
           the first 24 hours after vaccination. These are self-limiting and all spontaneously&#xD;
           resolve.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These side-effects are consistent with data from use with other recombinant MVAs&#xD;
           expressing other antigens (Moorthy VS et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immune responses measured 1 week after vaccination. We see strong immune responses 1&#xD;
           week after vaccination in the Oxford and Gambian volunteers (McShane et al, 2004). We do&#xD;
           not know how long the responses in the South African volunteers will last for, but we&#xD;
           would expect to see the induction of significant (compared with baseline) immune&#xD;
           responses as measured by the ex-vivo Elispot assay, 1 week after vaccination&#xD;
