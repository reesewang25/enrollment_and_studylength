  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether indometacin has an effect on reaction time,&#xD;
      postural stability, and the avoidance of obstacles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A lot of (epidemiologic) research is done on causes for falls and factors contributing to&#xD;
      falling. Most of this research was conducted on the elderly, either community-dwelling or&#xD;
      institutionalised. It became clear that the elderly have a greater risk at falling because&#xD;
      of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physiological changes due to increasing age [Gerdhem et al., 2005]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous falls [Myers et al., 1991; Lipsitz et al., 1992]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comorbidity (including RA) [Bergland et al., 2004; Gerdhem et al., 2005; Lawlor et al.,&#xD;
           2003]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  polypharmacy [Lawlor et al., 2003; Walker et al., 2005; Ziere et al., 2005] and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of specific drugs like antidepressives, benzodiazepines, vasodilators, and NSAIDs&#xD;
           [Cumming R, 1998; Herings RMC, 2001; Kallin K et al., 2004; Granek et al., 1987].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relation between benzodiazepines and falling has been extensively investigated in and&#xD;
      affirmed by several fields of research and is practically common sense. However, the&#xD;
      (possible) relation between NSAIDs and falling is much less investigated, even though there&#xD;
      are various articles in which a higher risk of falling when using NSAIDs is stated; sometimes&#xD;
      the risk is even as high as with benzodiazepines [Cumming R, 1998; Granek et al., 1987;&#xD;
      Walker et al., 2005].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSAIDs are drugs that are often prescribed to patients with rheumatic or orthopedic diseases.&#xD;
      They seem to be at a greater risk for falls than healthy persons because of their disease,&#xD;
      age and medication use. Therefore it is very important to keep this risk as small as&#xD;
      possible. In this study healthy adults are measured on reaction time, postural balance and&#xD;
      obstacle avoidance with and without use of indometacin or placebo. This is done in order to&#xD;
      gain more comprehension in the mechanism and actual risk for falls when using NSAIDs.&#xD;
