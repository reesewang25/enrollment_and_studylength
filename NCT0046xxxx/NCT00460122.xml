  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if transfusion of platelets containing HLA antibodies (certain&#xD;
      antibodies to white blood cells) are more likely to cause transfusion reactions than&#xD;
      transfusion of platelets that do not contain HLA antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age or older who donate platelets at the NIH Clinical Center may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extra tube of blood (about one teaspoon) is obtained from participating donors at the time&#xD;
      of their donation at the NIH Platelet Center. The blood plasma in the extra tube is tested&#xD;
      for HLA antibodies and antibodies to certain white blood cells called granulocytes. The&#xD;
      research sample is assigned a code number for identification and sent to the HLA Laboratory&#xD;
      in the Department of Transfusion Medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukocyte antibodies can cause febrile transfusion reactions, pulmonary reactions to&#xD;
      granulocyte transfusions, and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). Despite the fact&#xD;
      that the role of leukocyte antibodies in these reactions was first described almost 50 years&#xD;
      ago, and that TRALI is now the leading cause of transfusion related fatalities, much remains&#xD;
      uncertain concerning the role of HLA antibodies in these reactions. The primary purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to retrospectively and prospectively determine if the incidence and nature of&#xD;
      transfusion reactions differs in Clinical Center (CC) patients that were transfused with&#xD;
      platelet components from donors with HLA antibodies and those without HLA antibodies. In&#xD;
      addition, this study will prospectively determine the incidence of HLA antibodies in the NIH&#xD;
      Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) platelet donor population. In this natural history&#xD;
      study a 10-mL blood sample will be drawn from 600 platelet donors at the time that they are&#xD;
      in the DTM donating platelets and it will be tested for HLA antibodies in the DTM. The blood&#xD;
      sample for HLA antibody testing will be collected with other samples collected as part of the&#xD;
      regular platelet donation process. Reactions in platelet transfusion recipients will be&#xD;
      assessed by reviewing CC and DTM patient records.&#xD;
