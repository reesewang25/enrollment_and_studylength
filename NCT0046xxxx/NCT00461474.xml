    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct research to see if we can help people who have a&#xD;
      spinal cord injury and shoulder pain to decrease the pain in the shoulders. We are&#xD;
      investigating the effectiveness of a home exercise program for the shoulders and changes in&#xD;
      how tasks are performed compared to an educational program on shoulder pain. There are no new&#xD;
      experimental procedures included in this study; instead it is a comparison of two types of&#xD;
      treatment that have been provided for this problem before. The new part of this study is the&#xD;
      collecting of information before and after treatment. We hypothesize that those who&#xD;
      participate in this home exercise program will have decrease shoulder pain and increase&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults who sustain a spinal cord injury (SCI) now have the potential to lead active,&#xD;
      productive lives with near normal life expectancy. Recent studies have demonstrated that many&#xD;
      people with SCI develop health and functional problems at earlier ages than their&#xD;
      non-disabled peers, with symptoms often occurring between the mid-30's and the mid-50's.&#xD;
      These symptoms and impairments include: pain, musculoskeletal problems, declining energy,&#xD;
      loss of strength and new functional limitations. These are examples of the challenges people&#xD;
      may face as they reach mid-life with a SCI. A prevalent impairment in the long-term SCI&#xD;
      population is upper extremity pain. Both the incidence and severity of pain increase with&#xD;
      longer duration of SCI. The impact of shoulder pain on function and independence after SCI&#xD;
      can be significant and detrimental. Development of shoulder pain in the SCI population has&#xD;
      been associated with the increased weight-bearing demand placed on the upper extremities for&#xD;
      mobility, muscle imbalances in the shoulder girdle, poor postural alignment from trunk&#xD;
      paralysis and the need to function from a seated position. The efficacy of specific&#xD;
      interventions has not been fully investigated. Treatment effectiveness must be determined&#xD;
      using measures that include the pain impairment (severity), the disability or functional&#xD;
      limitation associated with pain, and the participation or handicap limitations associated&#xD;
      with pain. The goal is to develop a program that has standardized resistance, requires little&#xD;
      equipment, is simple to conduct and minimizes the time commitment required of the patient.&#xD;
      The effect of the combined intervention on shoulder pain and function will be assessed with a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial comparing the intervention to an attention control group receiving&#xD;
      generalized information regarding shoulder joint anatomy and pain management. Secondary goals&#xD;
      of this study are to identify the critical muscle groups for which strength changes are&#xD;
      associated with shoulder pain reduction and to determine the impact of the intervention on&#xD;
      physical activity, health related quality of life and overall subjective quality of life.&#xD;
