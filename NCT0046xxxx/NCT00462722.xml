      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of ibuprofen blocks the benefits of&#xD;
      exercise to build bone and muscle mass.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People are advised to engage in weight-bearing physical activity to help prevent the loss of&#xD;
      bone and muscle mass that occurs with aging. There is evidence from studies of animals that&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen, block some of the bone-&#xD;
      and muscle-building effects of exercise. The aim of this study is to determine whether use of&#xD;
      ibuprofen, either before or after exercise, blocks the benefits of exercise training on bone&#xD;
      and skeletal muscle in older women and men. The hypothesis is that taking ibuprofen before&#xD;
      exercise will block some of the effects of exercise training to increase bone density and&#xD;
      muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women and men aged 60-75 years will complete a supervised, 9-month exercise training program&#xD;
      designed to increase bone and muscle mass. The training will include weight lifting and&#xD;
      weight-bearing exercises, such as jumping in place and treadmill walking, up to 5 days per&#xD;
      week. Participants will be randomly assigned to take 1 of 3 study pill combinations before&#xD;
      and after each exercise session. The combinations of study pills will be: placebo&#xD;
      before/placebo after, placebo before/ibuprofen after, or ibuprofen before/placebo after. The&#xD;
      dose of ibuprofen will be 400 mg. Bone density of the hip and spine, body composition (total&#xD;
      body muscle and fat), and markers of bone turnover in the blood will be measured before and&#xD;
      after 4.5 and 9 months of training. Muscle cross-sectional area of the thigh will be measured&#xD;
      by CT before and after 9 months of training. A subset of participants will have biopsies of&#xD;
      the thigh muscle before and after training to measure proteins and genes associated with&#xD;
      muscle build-up and breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who do not use ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen more than 3 days per month&#xD;
      will be enrolled. People with intolerance to ibuprofen or related drugs, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, or orthopedic problems that limit exercise will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
