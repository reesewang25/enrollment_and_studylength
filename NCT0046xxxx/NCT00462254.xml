  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease represent a significant proportion of VA elderly patients.&#xD;
      Sleep disturbances and caregiver burnout association with this condition represent a&#xD;
      significant problem. In this study, the investigators propose to perform an evaluation of a&#xD;
      fixed doe of ramelteon on sleep in VA outpatients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be examined is that ramelteon will improve the quality of sleep in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease while indirectly improving the quality of life for the patients and&#xD;
      caregivers. The investigators further hypothesize that these changes will occur through&#xD;
      restructuring and normalization of the sleep architecture.&#xD;

      It is well established that sleep disturbances are common in patients with neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Together with psychosis and other behavioral&#xD;
      abnormalities they contribute to the stress, anxiety and cognitive decline of patients,&#xD;
      caregiver burnout and depression, as well as health care provider frustration. The mechanisms&#xD;
      of the sleep disturbances in these conditions are still poorly understood and no rational or&#xD;
      effective treatments have been proposed. Recent data from a study of ramelteon in the elderly&#xD;
      showed a striking ability of this compound to improve quality of sleep disturbances in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effects of ramelteon on the quality of sleep using sleep evaluation&#xD;
           instruments (SDQ-Sleep Disorder Questionnaire and Neuropsychiatric Inventory with&#xD;
           Caregiver Distress (NPI-D) Sleep Behavior Subscale administered to the patient and/or&#xD;
           their bed partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effects of ramelteon on daytime sleepiness and memory using Epworth&#xD;
           Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effects of ramelteon on the sleep/wake cycle and day/night activity&#xD;
           patterns over a prolonged period of time (1 week) using a motion logger (continuous&#xD;
           motor activity recording device) and computerized data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effects of ramelteon on sleep architecture in a sample of patients with&#xD;
           confirmed sleep disturbance, before and after ramelteon treatment by using&#xD;
           polysomnography.&#xD;
