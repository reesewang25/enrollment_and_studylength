  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic, unexplained pain symptoms are very common in all layers of the population, but it is&#xD;
      largely unknown what causes them. This study examines the hypothesis that patients with these&#xD;
      pain symptoms process pain abnormally in their brain. TO this aim, we compare patients and&#xD;
      healthy people: they receive mild pain at their painful body region and at another location.&#xD;
      Concurrently, we measure brain activity with brain scans (functional MRI scans). With our&#xD;
      study results, we want to increase understanding of what causes chronic, unexplained pain&#xD;
      symptoms, in order to find better methods of diagnosing and treating them.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic, unexplained pain is a heterogeneously defined, but common and recurring clinical&#xD;
      problem, in general medical practice as well as in specialist care. Chronic, unexplained pain&#xD;
      causes considerable loss of quality of life, frequent absence from work and it is a common&#xD;
      reason for health care visits. From a pathophysiological point of view, an augmented and&#xD;
      self-amplifying sensitivity for physical signals such as pain (as well as for other signals)&#xD;
      seems to be important. This is referred to as 'generalised hypervigilance', a specific type&#xD;
      of sensitisation. Central sensitisation mechanisms have been implied in several pain&#xD;
      syndromes. In our own psychophysical pilot study, we confirmed the existence of amplified&#xD;
      pain perception in chronic, unexplained pain, as well as the disturbed influence of&#xD;
      attentional processes. Our study results probably reflect a general disturbance of&#xD;
      perception, not associated with a specific body location. This general perceptual disturbance&#xD;
      is expressed in a stronger fashion in the clinically affected body region. Abnormal pattern&#xD;
      of cerebral pain processing have been found in functional MRI studies in other syndromes of&#xD;
      unknown origin, such as fibromyalgia, somatoform pain disorder and irritable bowel syndrome.&#xD;
      However, the role of several neurobiological factors in chronic, unexplained pain remain to&#xD;
      be elucidated and to be placed in the context of the biopsychosocial model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3T rapid event-related, Functional MRI-experiment into the cerebral processing of&#xD;
      experimental pain stimuli in chronic, unexplained pain-patients versus healthy controls.&#xD;
      Twelve chronic, unexplained pain-patients with unilateral limb pain and twelve healthy&#xD;
      control subjects experience painful and non-painful electrical stimuli on the painful limb,&#xD;
      whilst the attentional state of the subject is controlled. With functional MRI, we record the&#xD;
      pain-related cerebral activations and compare them between groups, in order to characterise&#xD;
      the cerebral correlates of altered pain processing in chronic, unexplained pain.&#xD;
