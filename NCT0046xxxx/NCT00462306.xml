  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition characterized by obstruction of the upper airways and&#xD;
      episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep. It is associated with significant adverse health&#xD;
      effects. The incidence of obstructive sleep apnea in the general female population is&#xD;
      approximately 2% but the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy is unknown. There&#xD;
      is some evidence that pregnancy precipitates or at least exacerbates this condition and that&#xD;
      there may be a relationship between intrauterine fetal growth retardation and maternal&#xD;
      preeclampsia. In addition, there are several anesthetic implications that are concern for the&#xD;
      patient with obstructive sleep apnea. These include: exquisite sensitivity to all central&#xD;
      nervous system depressant drugs and the potential for upper airway obstruction or apnea with&#xD;
      even minimal drug doses; difficult mask ventilation; difficult intubation; arterial&#xD;
      hypoxemia; arterial hypercarbia; polycythemia; hypertension; pulmonary hypertension and&#xD;
      cardiac failure. All of these conditions pose significant anesthetic risk for the patient,&#xD;
      and this risk may be increased further by pregnancy.&#xD;

      All patients presenting to the Prentice Women's Hospital's (PWH) Labor and Delivery Unit for&#xD;
      spontaneous labor, induction of labor and scheduled cesarean delivery are routinely&#xD;
      interviewed by a member of the anesthesia team to obtain a detailed history and physical&#xD;
      examination and to discuss labor analgesia options. Immediately following this usual and&#xD;
      customary preanesthetic evaluation the member of the anesthesia team performing the&#xD;
      preanesthetic consultation (anesthesiology attending, resident physician, or nurse) used a&#xD;
      standard verbal consent script to obtain verbal consent from the subject for study&#xD;
      participation. Study participants were asked to complete a written validated survey, the&#xD;
      Berlin Questionnaire, evaluating self-reported snoring and daytime sleepiness as well as&#xD;
      basic demographic data (age, height, current weight and pregnancy weight gain). Survey&#xD;
      completion time was 1 to 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey was available in English and Spanish. It did not contain any subject personal&#xD;
      health information. The survey sheet remained in the labor and delivery room with the&#xD;
      subject's usual anesthesia medical record paperwork until the patient was discharged from the&#xD;
      unit. At the time of discharge, the infant's birthweight and APGAR scores were recorded on&#xD;
      the survey and the survey collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All female patients, ages 18 - 45, presenting to the PWH Operating Room for elective&#xD;
      gynecologic surgery, and all female patients, ages 18 - 45, presenting to the Northwestern&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital (NMH) Ambulatory Surgery Center were interviewed by a member of the&#xD;
      anesthesia team to obtain a routine preoperative history and physical examination and to&#xD;
      discuss the anesthesia options. Immediately following this usual and customary preanesthetic&#xD;
      evaluation the member of the anesthesia team performing the preanesthetic consultation&#xD;
      (anesthesiology attending, resident physician, or certified registered nurse anesthetist)&#xD;
      used a standard verbal consent script to obtain verbal consent from the subject for study&#xD;
      participation. Study participants were asked to complete a written validated survey, the&#xD;
      Berlin Questionnaire, evaluating self-reported snoring and daytime sleepiness as well as&#xD;
      basic demographic data (age, height, and weight). The survey was available in English and&#xD;
      Spanish. Survey completion time was 1-2 minutes. The survey did not contain any patient&#xD;
      identifying information and was collected after completion.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>We compared Berlin Questionnaire scores between pregnant and nonpregnant females between October 2005 through September 2007. The study group consisted of pregnant women presenting to Prentice Women's Hospital and non-pregnant females (control group) presenting to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for ambulatory surgery.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>An anesthesia team member used a standard verbal consent script to obtain verbal consent for study participation. 4074 parturients and 503 non-pregnant women completed the Berlin Questionnaire. 13 of the non-pregnant patient questionnaires were excluded due to insufficient data.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Positive Berlin Questionnaire Indicative of Sleep Disordered Breathing</title>
          <description>The Berlin Questionnaire consists of three categories designed to elicit information regarding snoring (category 1), daytime somnolence (category 2), and the presence of obesity and/or hypertension (category 3). Categories 1 and 2 are considered positive if 2 or more responses are positive category 3 is considered positive if 1 response is positive and/or the body mass index is greater than 30 kg per meter squared. A patient is considered to have a high likelihood of sleep disordered breathing if 2 or more categories are positive.</description>
