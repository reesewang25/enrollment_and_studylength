  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure (ARF) is a rare but serious complication of gastroenteritis and&#xD;
      dehydration, the most common reason for pediatric emergency visits. Renal function is&#xD;
      determined by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Serum creatinine, the current marker of&#xD;
      GFR, is insensitive and a late marker of ARF. Unfortunately, &quot;gold standard&quot; methods for&#xD;
      measurement of GFR are impractical in the emergency setting. Recently, cystatin C (CysC) was&#xD;
      introduced as superior marker for the measurement of GFR, particularly in children. A single&#xD;
      random blood sample allows for accurate determination of GFR in the so-called&#xD;
      &quot;creatinine-blind&quot; range and independent of the body composition. There is growing evidence&#xD;
      that the determination of serum CysC concentration can detect ARF in adults earlier than&#xD;
      serum creatinine or urinary fractional sodium excretion. No studies have examined this marker&#xD;
      for the early detection of ARF in children at risk. We therefore propose a prospective study&#xD;
      that compares CysC with other biomarkers of renal dysfunction for the early detection of ARF&#xD;
      in children with dehydration due to gastroenteritis. Patients with minor trauma and a minimal&#xD;
      likelihood of ARF will serve as a control. This study may establish CysC as an accurate and&#xD;
      cost-effective marker for identifying patients at risk.&#xD;

      -  Rationale and hypotheses: Acute renal failure is a relatively rare but serious illness&#xD;
           in children. Early detection is important in preventing life threatening complications&#xD;
           that can arise from acute renal failure. Presently, most methods of determining renal&#xD;
           function are either too cumbersome, too invasion or too unreliable to be used in&#xD;
           children. Current evidence has shown that serum cystatin C is more precise and&#xD;
           cost-effective in determining renal function. Our objective is to compare serum cystatin&#xD;
           C with other biomarkers as an early diagnostic detection for renal dysfunction in&#xD;
           children with acute renal failure in an emergency setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design and methods: This is a prospective double cohort control study to compare&#xD;
           the serum creatinine and serum cystatin C in detecting early renal dysfunction in&#xD;
           children presenting to the emergency department. The study will be conducted in CHEO&#xD;
           emergency department. A study nurse will identify eligible patients and discuss whether&#xD;
           to approach the families with either the bedside nurse or attending physician before&#xD;
           meeting them. Interested families are than given an explanation of our study. Once&#xD;
           written consent is obtained, a copy will be given to the family. Additional tests will&#xD;
           than be requested from blood and urine samples of the patients. Only patients that&#xD;
           already require an intravenous needling are eligible for this study. No additional&#xD;
           needling is therefore needed as part of this study. Urine sample will only be obtained&#xD;
           through bad or voiding samples. No catheter urine samples will be requested as part of&#xD;
           this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject selection: Our target population are patients presenting to the CHEO emergency&#xD;
           department with the diagnoses of gastroenteritis and dehydration, and requiring&#xD;
           intravenous rehydration. Our control group are patients with traumatic injury requiring&#xD;
           conscious sedation and intravenous access. We will exclude patients who are known to&#xD;
           have underlying kidney diseases, renal transplantation, thyroid dysfunction, chronic&#xD;
           systematic steroid uses, genitourinary trauma and patients transferred from another&#xD;
           hospitals for ongoing assessment and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specify the number of participants drawn from CHEO and other centres: CHEO is the only&#xD;
           designated centre for the study. 464 patients will be recruited to complete the study,&#xD;
           232 in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delineate the outcomes to be measured and analyzed: The primary outcome measures are to&#xD;
           compare the sensitivity and the timing of detecting early renal dysfunction using either&#xD;
           serum creatinine or serum cystatin C in the paediatric emergency setting. Our secondary&#xD;
           outcome measures are to compare serum cystatin C to other surrogate renal markers for&#xD;
           acute renal failure. Other renal markers include calculated Schwartz glomerular&#xD;
           filtration rate, urine microprotein excretion, fractional excretions of sodium and urea,&#xD;
           serum sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, urine Na/K ratio and regular urinalysis. Additional&#xD;
           analysis will be conducted on the comparison of fractional excretion of urea to&#xD;
           fractional excretion of sodium as an earlier marker of dehydration in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticipated benefits/harms and how these will be addressed: Only patients who already&#xD;
           require needling as part of their hospital care are eligible for the study. No&#xD;
           additional needling is therefore requested. Additional tests will be requested that&#xD;
           would otherwise not be part of the routine care of these patients. It is therefore&#xD;
           possible that a kidney disorder will be identified in a child who was not yet diagnosed&#xD;
           with this disease. We will discuss this possibility with the family before enrollment of&#xD;
           the patient. All major abnormalities will be followed by both the attending physician&#xD;
           and the principle investigators of the study and appropriate care will apply. We do not&#xD;
           intervene with the ongoing care of the patients while the patients remain in hospital.&#xD;
           The study will terminate when patients are discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data fields (if any) to be abstracted from the patient's health record: We will record&#xD;
           patient's CHEO medical record number for the purpose of retrieving laboratory data; date&#xD;
           of birth; biometric measurement (height, weight and sex). No other identifiable&#xD;
           information will be record on the data sheet. No individual information will be used for&#xD;
           publication or presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent documents and any advertisement notices must be appended to the application.&#xD;
      Both English and French versions of the consent forms and information sheets are enclosed&#xD;
      with this application.&#xD;
