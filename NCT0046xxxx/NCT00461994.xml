    <textblock>
      A 3-arms randomized prospective intervention study to determine the roles of exercise and/or&#xD;
      diet on weight loss and weight maintenance in obese preadolescent children 6-11 year-old with&#xD;
      BMI&gt; 95th percentile for age and gender. Children were randomly allocated into three groups.&#xD;
      The first group underwent an exercise program, the second one underwent both an exercise&#xD;
      program and a diet program and the third underwent a diet program alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the intervention is 12 weeks followed by a period of 9 months of&#xD;
      follow-up. The effects of the different intervention on weight loss and weight&#xD;
      maintenance,body composition, on hormonal components that regulate the caloric balance, on&#xD;
      metabolic profile and cardiovascular risk factors and on psychological parameters were also&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A 3-arms randomized prospective intervention study including 161 patients in order to&#xD;
      determine the roles of exercise and/or diet on weight loss and weight maintenance in obese&#xD;
      preadolescent children 6-11 year-old with BMI&gt; 95th percentile for age and gender. The study&#xD;
      recruited patients from 2 endocrine clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The main aim was to determine the roles of exercise and/or diet on weight loss and&#xD;
           weight maintenance in obese children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary goals were:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To determine the effects of exercise and/or diet on body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To determine the effects of exercise and/or diet on leptin and ghrelin that play a&#xD;
                role in the regulation of energy balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To determine the effects of exercise and/or diet on metabolic profile,&#xD;
                cardiovascular risk factors, and inflammatory markers as fasting glucose,insulin&#xD;
                and lipid profile,homocysteine ,adiponectin levels,CRP,and IL-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To determine the role of exercise and/or diet on psychological parameters of obese&#xD;
                children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obese preadolescent children 6-11 year-old with BMI&gt; 95th percentile for age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A signed informed consent will be taken from patients and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Agreement to a follow-up of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiac problems (arrhythmia, Congestive heart disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe hepatic impairment (liver enzymes above 3 folds the upper normal values)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Genetic syndromes associated with obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Presence of untreated hypothyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Participation in a clinical study during the last month methods Children fulfilling the&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly allocated into one of three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group underwent an exercise program, the second one underwent both an exercise&#xD;
      program and a diet program and the third underwent a diet program alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first visit of the study, at the end of the intervention (12 weeks) and at the end of&#xD;
      the follow-up period (1 year) the following had been checked:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight, Height, Body impedance, Waist and hip circumferences, Skin-folds, Blood pressure,&#xD;
      Basal Metabolic Rate (evaluated by a metabolic monitor), and blood samples for: Blood count,&#xD;
      Liver function, Renal function, Fasting Lipid, glucose and insulin,CRP, IL-6, TSH, free T4,&#xD;
      Homocysteine, Adiponectin, Leptin and Ghrelin. Also at these point of time every patient&#xD;
      underwent a psychosocial evaluation with life style questioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:There were no complications with these modes of treatment.&#xD;
