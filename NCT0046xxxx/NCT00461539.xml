      This study will determine the effectiveness of a health education intervention in reducing&#xD;
      health risk behavior and improving health in adolescents with depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common disorder among adolescents. If left untreated, it can cause&#xD;
      significant disability, illness, and even death. Teens with depression often engage in risky&#xD;
      health behaviors, such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, unprotected sex, and unhealthy&#xD;
      eating and exercise patterns. By reducing these health risk behaviors, depressed adolescents&#xD;
      may be able to avoid negative health consequences and improve their physical and mental&#xD;
      health. This study will determine the effectiveness of a health education intervention in&#xD;
      reducing risky health behaviors in adolescents with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be invited to enroll during a visit to a participating&#xD;
      primary care clinic. Participants will be randomly assigned to either partake in a health&#xD;
      education intervention or receive standard care. Both groups will continue to receive&#xD;
      treatment through their primary care clinic. Those participants receiving standard care will&#xD;
      be referred to special programs as needed to reduce their involvement in risky health&#xD;
      behaviors. Participants assigned to the health education intervention will attend 10 weekly&#xD;
      education sessions that will be led by trained health educators. Parents or guardians may be&#xD;
      asked to attend sessions depending on their interest in the intervention and the age of the&#xD;
      youth participant. Topics covered will include teenage smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, risky&#xD;
      sexual behaviors, and obesity. Cognitive-behavioral strategies, role playing, and media clips&#xD;
      will be used to stimulate discussion and involvement in the intervention. The intervention&#xD;
      will be tailored to target the specific risky behaviors in which each participant engages.&#xD;
      Motivational interviewing will also be used to build positive attitudes to support behavior&#xD;
      change. All participants will attend follow-up visits to assess behavior change at Months 6&#xD;
      and 12 following study entry.&#xD;
