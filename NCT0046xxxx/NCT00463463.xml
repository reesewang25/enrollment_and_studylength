      High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation have an established role in&#xD;
      the treatment of aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) when refractory to first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy or after relapse. The PARMA study randomized 109 patients, with chemo-sensitive&#xD;
      relapse and no marrow involvement to receive, following the initial salvage regimen,&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy versus continuous standard dose chemotherapy. 5-year progression-free&#xD;
      survival was 46% in the transplant group compared with 12% in the chemotherapy group. Results&#xD;
      are significantly inferior in patients with multiply relapsed or chemo-refractory disease&#xD;
      with only 0-20% of patients achieving long-term disease control with autologous&#xD;
      transplantation. Thus a large proportion of patients with refractory and relapsing disease&#xD;
      are not cured with currently available transplantation methods and newer approaches are&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is the first monoclonal antibody approved for clinical use. It is an anti CD20&#xD;
      antibody with high response rate in the treatment of follicular lymphoma and increases&#xD;
      response rate in aggressive lymphoma when combined with chemotherapy. It is well tolerated&#xD;
      with minimal side effects. However tumors may escape rituximab sensitivity by loss of&#xD;
      antigen, poor access of antibody to bulky or poorly vascularized tumors, or failure of host&#xD;
      effectors to eliminate antibody binding tumor cells. Lymphoma cells are inherently and&#xD;
      exquisitely sensitive to radiation. Radioimmunotherapy uses monoclonal antibodies conjugated&#xD;
      with a radioactive isotope to target radiation directly to tumor cells. Ibritumomab is the&#xD;
      parent murine anti CD20 antibody witch targets the same epitope as rituximab. Tiuxetan is a&#xD;
      chelator covalently linked to the antibody which chelates the isotope 90Yttrium to form the&#xD;
      active radioconjugate Zevalin. 90Yttrium is a pure high-energy beta emitter with a relatively&#xD;
      short half time (64 hours) and a path length of 5 mm. These properties make it an ideal&#xD;
      isotope for radioimmmunotherapy. The high energy and long beta path are advantageous in&#xD;
      treating bulky, poorly vascularized tumors, and tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression&#xD;
      as neighboring tumor cells can be hit by cross fire from tumors binding the radioconjugate.&#xD;
      Pure beta emission limits radiation to the patient body and is safe for the surrounding&#xD;
      allowing simple outpatient care, no need for patient isolation or shielding. Biodistribution&#xD;
      is predictable, eliminating the need for dosimetry. Initial studies showed that Zevalin has a&#xD;
      favorable toxicity profile and is more effective than rituximab in patients with follicular&#xD;
      and transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and studies are currently performed in aggressive&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are initial phase I-II studies combining radioimmunotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy&#xD;
      and autologous stem-cell transplantation with promising results. We conducted a phase II&#xD;
      study of fixed-dose Zevalin at 0.4 mCi/kg with BEAM high-dose chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      chemo-refractory disease. So far, 23 patients were included. With a median follow-up of 17&#xD;
      months the estimated progression-free survival was 52% compared with 0-20% expected in&#xD;
      patients with multiply relapsed and chemo-refractory disease. Based on these data and data&#xD;
      from other groups we expect that the addition of Zevalin to standard high-dose chemotherapy&#xD;
      will improve transplantation outcomes in patients with standard-risk chemosensitive disease,&#xD;
      as well. This study will randomize patients to Zevalin-BEAM versus BEAM alone to determine&#xD;
      the potential of Zevalin radioimmunotherapy to improve outcome of autologous stem-cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
