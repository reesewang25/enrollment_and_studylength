  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical errors that affect patient safety have generated huge concern since the publication&#xD;
      of &quot;To Err Is Human&quot; 6 years ago [1]. Given the complexity of management in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU) and the nature of human activities, critically ill patients are exposed to&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) induced by medical errors. A large number of studies have focused on AEs&#xD;
      and medical errors in ICUs [2-6], one of their main goals being to identify strategies for&#xD;
      preventing AEs and thereby improving patient outcomes. Choosing the best AE to serve as an&#xD;
      indicator for the risk of medical error is challenging. In 2005, our group conducted a&#xD;
      systematic literature review and presented the results to 30 national experts with clinical&#xD;
      backgrounds in internal, emergency, and intensive care medicine. Using the Delphi technique,&#xD;
      these experts selected 14 AEs that had the following characteristics: high frequency, easy&#xD;
      and reproducible definition, association with morbidity and mortality, and ease of reporting&#xD;
      without fear of punishment (Iatroref I study) (ref abstract). These AEs were used in a French&#xD;
      multicenter study (75 ICUs) for a weeklong incidence evaluation (Iatroref II study) (ref&#xD;
      abstract). Preliminary evaluation of the results allowed us to choose the following AEs for&#xD;
      the current Iatroref III study: error in insulin administration, error in anticoagulant&#xD;
      administration, error in anticoagulant prescription, unplanned extubation, and unplanned&#xD;
      removal of central venous catheter. Evidence suggests that guidelines alone without&#xD;
      reinforcing strategies may be insufficient to change provider behavior and that the most&#xD;
      effective interventions may be multifaceted rather than single-component strategies ([7]).&#xD;
      This study will test a composite intervention program. The objectives of the study are to&#xD;
      determine whether the introduction of a composite intervention program decreases the&#xD;
      predefined AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: The intervention program will decrease the incidence of the predefined AEs.&#xD;

      Design and methods Definition of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Error in insulin administration Insulin not given exactly as prescribed (including in&#xD;
           the written protocol used in the ICU). The error may be a planning error or an&#xD;
           implementation error regarding the nature of the insulin, dosage, preparation&#xD;
           modalities, or administration modalities. Insulin therapy requires monitoring of&#xD;
           capillary blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Error in anticoagulant prescription Non respect of the recommendations about&#xD;
           indications, dosages, administration modalities, contraindications, drug-drug&#xD;
           interactions, and laboratory monitoring using the VIDAL (French Drug Compendium),&#xD;
           learned societies, ICU protocols, and local drug committees. Either unfractionated&#xD;
           heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin may be involved&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Error in anticoagulant administration Anticoagulant not given exactly as prescribed. The&#xD;
           error may be a planning error or an implementation error regarding the nature of the&#xD;
           anticoagulant, dosage, preparation modalities, administration modalities, dosing times,&#xD;
           or dosing intervals. Either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin may&#xD;
           be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unplanned catheter removal Unplanned complete removal of a central venous catheter by&#xD;
           the patient or by staff while caring for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Unplanned extubation Extubation not planned by the physicians. Unplanned extubations can&#xD;
           be categorized as self-extubation by the patient, or accidental extubation for technical&#xD;
           reasons (porosity, section of the balloon, poorly secured tube), and during patient care&#xD;
           (bathing, taking radiographs, transportation, care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure We will use a multicenter cluster randomized design to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention. Our statistician will randomly assign each unit&#xD;
      to compliance with ICU guidelines as usual or implementation of the multifaceted intervention&#xD;
      to prevent one of the AEs. Randomization will occur at the ICU level. Units that do not use&#xD;
      the intervention program will serve as controls. The randomization procedure will be repeated&#xD;
      every 2 1/2 months for a total of four 21/2-month periods in 2007-2008. During the month of&#xD;
      January, the study will be prepared at each site, where a clinical research assistant will be&#xD;
      trained in the use of RheaTM data collection software (http://outcomerea.org/rhea/install).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Iatroref II study, anticoagulant prescription or administration errors occurred in&#xD;
      59/1377 (about 6%) patients, insulin administration errors in more than 20% of patients, and&#xD;
      unplanned catheter or endotracheal tube removal in 4% of patients. For this study, we&#xD;
      collapsed unplanned catheter removal and unplanned extubation into a single group and&#xD;
      administration error and prescription error of anticiagulant in another single group.&#xD;
      Assuming that more than 2400 patients will be admitted to the four study ICUs during the&#xD;
      study period, the study would have greater than 80% power for detecting a 4% absolute&#xD;
      decrease in anticoagulant errors, a 3% absolute decrease in unplanned catheter or&#xD;
      endotracheal tube removal, and a 10% absolute decrease in insulin treatment errors. We will&#xD;
      use the two-sided score test for comparisons (Farrington and Manning). P levels â‰¤0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions In each study ICU, a physician trained in clinical research and a a clinical&#xD;
      research assistant will prepare the study during the two weeks preceding randomization. The&#xD;
      intervention for each AEs will include three components: meeting with the ICU nurses and&#xD;
      physicians, distribution of educational materials including a pocket card showing the&#xD;
      recommendations about prevention of each AE, and quality improvement sessions twice a month.&#xD;
      At each site, the physician trained in clinical research and the clinical research assistant&#xD;
      will lead feedback meetings with the ICU staff every 2 weeks 1) to provide feedback about AEs&#xD;
      that occurred in the last 2 weeks, 2) to review compliance with recommendations on the pocket&#xD;
      card, and 3) to analyze the causes of AEs and suggest practice changes if appropriate. A&#xD;
      report on each meeting will be drafted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for insulin administration errors&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Meeting with the ICU staff to discuss the epidemiology of patients admitted with&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus outside the ICU, the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in ICU&#xD;
           patients, and clinical studies of glycemic control and mortality in wards and ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pocket card showing how and why to control blood glucose and giving the guidelines for&#xD;
           controlling blood glucose levels with insulin infusions according to the protocol in&#xD;
           each study ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Feedback meeting twice a month on insulin administration errors in the unit,&#xD;
           preventability, and appropriate changes in insulin treatment procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for anticoagulant administration errors&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Meeting with the ICU staff to discuss the pathophysiology of anticoagulants (heparin and&#xD;
           HBPM), indications, AEs, and specific problems in the ICU (e.g., use during dialysis and&#xD;
           in patients with renal failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pocket card showing the nature of the anticoagulants, AEs, route of administration (IV&#xD;
           or enteral), specific problems in the ICU (e.g., use during dialysis and in patients&#xD;
           with renal failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Feedback meeting twice a month on anticoagulant administration errors in the unit,&#xD;
           causes of noncompliance with prescriptions, and preventability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for anticoagulant prescription errors&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Meeting with the ICU staff to discuss the pathophysiology of anticoagulants (heparin and&#xD;
           HBPM), indications, AEs, and specific problems in the ICU (e.g., use during dialysis and&#xD;
           in patients with renal failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pocket cards with the nature of the anticoagulants, indications, dosage, route of&#xD;
           administration, and Aes, as recommended by the French Society for Anesthesiology in 2005&#xD;
           in a consensus conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Feedback meeting twice a month on anticoagulant prescription errors in the unit, causes&#xD;
           of noncompliance with recommendations, and preventability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for unplanned extubation and catheter removal&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Meeting with the ICU staff to discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, mortality, and&#xD;
           prevention of unplanned extubation and catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pocket card showing methods for securing catheters and endotracheal tubes, the sedation&#xD;
           protocol, and the weaning protocol of each ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Feedback meeting twice a month on occurrence of these AEs in the unit, causes, and&#xD;
           preventability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population All patients admitted to the four study ICUs after January, 2007 will be&#xD;
      included. No patients will be excluded. The study has been submitted to the appropriate&#xD;
      ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Patients Data are collected in the Outcomerea database. For each patient, the&#xD;
      clinical research assistant will complete a case-report form on a computer using data capture&#xD;
      software (Rhea) then will import all records to the Outcomerea database. The following&#xD;
      information will be recorded prospectively: demographic characteristics (age, sex, and body&#xD;
      mass index); underlying diseases using the Knaus classification [8]; admission category&#xD;
      (medical, scheduled surgery, or unscheduled surgery), invasive procedures (arterial or venous&#xD;
      central catheter, Swan-Ganz catheter, and endotracheal intubation), nosocomial infections&#xD;
      (ventilator-associated pneumonia, nosocomial bacteremia, urinary tract infections, surgical&#xD;
      site infections, and sinusitis), and decisions to withhold and/or withdraw life-sustaining&#xD;
      treatments. The location of the patient prior to ICU admission will be recorded, with&#xD;
      transfer from wards being defined as admission to the same hospital or another hospital&#xD;
      before ICU admission. Severity of illness will be recorded at admission and once a day&#xD;
      thereafter. Day 1 is the interval from admission to 8 A.M. on the next day; all other days&#xD;
      are calendar days from 8 A.M. to 8 A.M. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) [9]&#xD;
      at admission and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) [10] score are computed using the worst&#xD;
      physical and laboratory data during the first 24 hours in the ICU. Duration of stays in the&#xD;
      ICU and acute-care hospital and vital status at ICU and hospital discharge will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events All AEs will be collected during all four periods, regardless of the&#xD;
      intervention being implemented. For each AE, Rhea software will be used to collect the date&#xD;
      and time of occurrence, clinical consequences (from a predefined list), therapeutic&#xD;
      consequences (from a predefined list), preventability, severity, and relation with death on a&#xD;
      five-item scale (excluded, very less unlikely, less unlikely, unlikely, likely, certainly).&#xD;
      An open box will be available for description of the AEs if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis A hierarchical (patients/center) logistic model will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of each intervention. The intervention, as well as interactions between periods&#xD;
      and specific interventions, will be taken into account.&#xD;
