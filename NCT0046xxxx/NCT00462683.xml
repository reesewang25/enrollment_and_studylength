      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the state of bone health of brain injury patients&#xD;
      being seen within a rehabilitation setting. Osteopenia is a condition of bone in which&#xD;
      decreased calcification, decreased density, or reduced mass occurs. Osteoporosis is a disease&#xD;
      in which the bones become extremely porous, are subject to fracture, and heal slowly. More&#xD;
      specifically, the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis at specific anatomic locations&#xD;
      (e.g., forearms, hips, spine) will be determined as will specific interventions (e.g., use of&#xD;
      vitamins, nutritional supplements, specific prescription medications) that people with brain&#xD;
      injury may be applying, or have applied, to manage their bone health. An attempt will also be&#xD;
      made to evaluate severity of brain injury, based on loss of muscle strength/function, and to&#xD;
      compare this data with bone-focused information such as bone mineral density (BMD), falls,&#xD;
      and history.&#xD;

      Primary Outcomes: As this study has no control or comparator group, the goal will be to&#xD;
      provide descriptive data regarding the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis at each of&#xD;
      the anatomic sites evaluated by DEXA in this specialized population (BMD outcome measures).&#xD;
      Additionally, the use of bone-specific interventions (vitamins, nutritional supplements,&#xD;
      medications), previous diagnostic testing (DEXA) and history of falls and fractures will be&#xD;
      assessed to determine the extent to which bone health has been considered and evaluated in&#xD;
      this population of individuals at increased risk of fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Functional status measures will also be obtained to enable correlation&#xD;
      with bone data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves a cross-sectional, descriptive evaluation of a cohort of 225 patients&#xD;
      with brain injury who are being managed at the out-patient clinics by physicians from RIC.&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to provide representative data of both the general bone health of&#xD;
      this population of patients (degree, extent and localization of bone loss) as well as&#xD;
      interventions that may have been implemented to manage their bone health (vitamins,&#xD;
      nutritional supplements, prescription medications). After obtaining informed consent, those&#xD;
      patients who wish to be involved will be asked to complete a medical history questionnaire&#xD;
      that focuses on bone health and will then undergo measurement of bone density by DEXA (dual&#xD;
      energy X-ray absorptiometry). At the time of the DEXA examination, muscle strength will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a trained research coordinator. A dietary history and a blood sample will also&#xD;
      be obtained, the latter for storage in order to later measure vitamin D levels and/or other&#xD;
      bone markers. All subjects will then be given the opportunity to continue in the longitudinal&#xD;
      arm of the study (second phase). Those who do will sign the informed consent and will then be&#xD;
      re-evaluated at yearly intervals with the same set of data being obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Data to be Obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographics: date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detailed and complete medical history, with particular focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Information regarding brain injury: time of occurrence, motor/sensory, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bone specific information: history of falls, fractures, use of medications,&#xD;
                smoking, alcohol, family history of osteoporosis and fractures, previous DEXA, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaire of functional status: use of affected arm, ambulation, assistive&#xD;
                device, orthotic, frequency of spasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of motor status using the Motor Components of the NIH Stroke Scale&#xD;
                (items 4 - 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dietary history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. DEXA evaluation. Specific measurements will be made for lumbar spine, hip and distal&#xD;
      radius; lateral vertebral assessment will be obtained if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Two 10ml tubes of blood will be obtained from each participant. Serum will be separated&#xD;
      and frozen in two aliquots to be saved for possible measurement of vitamin D levels (25OH&#xD;
      vitamin D) and/or bone markers.&#xD;
