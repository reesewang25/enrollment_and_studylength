      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the tumor growth by&#xD;
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells. Gemcitabine and bevacizumab may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Giving gemcitabine together with bevacizumab and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with&#xD;
      bevacizumab and abdominal radiation therapy works in treating patients with localized&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with concurrent bevacizumab,&#xD;
           gemcitabine hydrochloride, and abdominal radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the quantitative toxicity associated with the delivery of this regimen in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 1-year and median survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the patterns of recurrence in the entire population of patients treated with&#xD;
           this regimen and in the subgroup that is resected for cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the surgical experience of patients who undergo surgical resection after&#xD;
           completion of protocol-directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the toxicity associated with surgical resection in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of&#xD;
      courses 1 and 3 and on days 1, 8, and 15 of course 2. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV&#xD;
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 of course 1, on days 8 and 22 of course 2, and on day 8&#xD;
      of course 3. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of the second course of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, patients undergo concurrent abdominal radiotherapy once daily, five days a&#xD;
      week, for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated at week 10. Patients whose disease deemed resectable after study&#xD;
      treatment undergo standard pancreatic resection at least 6 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      bevacizumab. Patients who remain unresectable and have not progressed after completion of&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy may begin maintenance therapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
      Treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride and bevacizumab repeats every 4 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
