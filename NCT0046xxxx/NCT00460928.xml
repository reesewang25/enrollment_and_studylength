    <textblock>
      Neonatal lupus (NL) is the name given to a group of conditions that can affect the babies of&#xD;
      mothers who have certain autoantibodies against components of the body's cells that are&#xD;
      called SSA/Ro and SSB/La. NL can appear as a temporary rash that usually goes away by the&#xD;
      time the baby is 6 months old, or very rarely an abnormal blood or liver condition that also&#xD;
      improves with time - or it can cause permanent and often life-threatening damage to the fetal&#xD;
      heart, known as congenital heart block (CHB). In women with anti-Ro/La antibodies who are&#xD;
      pregnant for the first time, only about 2% of the babies will develop CHB. But for a woman&#xD;
      who has already had a child with CHB or NL rash, the risk of CHB in her next pregnancy is&#xD;
      nearly 20%. Unfortunately, once complete (third degree) heart block has been unequivocally&#xD;
      identified in a fetus, it has never been reversed with any of the therapies that have been&#xD;
      tried to date. Our previous studies strongly indicate that scarring of the conduction system&#xD;
      (the heart's own natural &quot;pacemaker&quot;), a consequence of inflammation triggered by the&#xD;
      mother's antibodies, damages or even destroys the cells that allow the heart to beat at a&#xD;
      normal rhythm. Instead, the damaged heart beats extremely slowly, to an extent that is fatal&#xD;
      to nearly 20% of affected babies (with most deaths occurring as fetal demises). Nearly all&#xD;
      surviving children with CHB require permanent implantation of a pacemaker device. Because it&#xD;
      is so difficult to treat or repair the damaged heart, a high-priority strategy is to try to&#xD;
      prevent the inflammatory process before irreversible scarring can occur. The aim of this&#xD;
      clinical-based proposal is to determine whether treating the pregnant mother with intravenous&#xD;
      immune globulin (IVIG) will prevent the development of CHB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perhaps the strongest clinical association with autoantibodies against SSA/Ro-SSB/La is the&#xD;
      development of congenital heart block (CHB) in an offspring, an alarming prospect facing 2%&#xD;
      of primigravid mothers with these antibodies. Recurrence rates approach 20%. Disease can&#xD;
      progress rapidly, with advanced block and life-threatening cardiomyopathy observed less than&#xD;
      2 weeks from normal sinus rhythm. Once 3rd degree (complete) block is identified, reversal&#xD;
      has never been achieved, despite dexamethasone. This makes biologic sense since the signature&#xD;
      lesion is fibrosis of the atrioventricular node. Thus, strategies aimed at preventing disease&#xD;
      assume high priority. Although disease expression in the fetus requires additional factors to&#xD;
      amplify the cascade to fibrosis, maternal anti-Ro/La antibodies are necessary. Accordingly,&#xD;
      eliminating fetal exposure to these antibodies is a sound and important approach. Intravenous&#xD;
      immune globulin (IVIG) is particularly exciting in its potential not only to lower maternal&#xD;
      antibody levels (which is not accomplished with glucocorticoids or immunosuppression), but&#xD;
      actually to influence effector mechanisms in the fetus itself. Aim 1 is a clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of IVIG in preventing CHB. Proof of efficacy is challenging since CHB&#xD;
      occurs in only 2% of first pregnancies of anti-Ro/La+ women. However, given the 10-fold&#xD;
      higher risk of CHB in a pregnancy after the birth of child with neonatal lupus (NL), mothers&#xD;
      with previous NL-affected children are the target population for study. Sample size&#xD;
      calculations employ Simon's 2-stage optimal design. Based on a 2-sided significance level of&#xD;
      0.05, a power of 90% to show reduction of risk to 5% given the prediction that 18% of&#xD;
      untreated subjects will get some degree of CHB, Stage 1 will enroll 19 women who have had a&#xD;
      previous child with CHB or NL rash, to receive IVIG (400 mg/kg IVIG every 3 weeks for a total&#xD;
      of 5 treatments) from weeks 12 through 24 of gestation. If fewer than 3 mothers have children&#xD;
      with 2nd or 3rd degree block, then an additional 35 mothers will be enrolled in Stage 2&#xD;
      (total = 54 subjects). IVIG will be considered efficacious and worthy of further study if&#xD;
      fewer than 6 of 54 subjects have a child with advanced CHB. Secondary outcomes include 1st&#xD;
      degree block, myocardial injury absent conduction defects, and isolated endocardial&#xD;
      fibroelastosis as assessed by serial fetal echocardiograms and EKG at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will address: a) the effect of IVIG on antibody titer and subclass; b) genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms in Fc gamma receptor (FcgR) and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase and&#xD;
      their potential association with response to IVIG; c) whether a decrease in anti-La&#xD;
      antibodies positively correlates with the level of anti-La antiidiotypic antibodies; d)&#xD;
      whether IVIG blocks expression of activation markers on human macrophages after challenge&#xD;
      with opsonized apoptotic cardiocytes and whether this positively correlates with increased&#xD;
      expression of the inhibitory Fc receptor, FcgRIIb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, IVIG is a promising agent that may have effects at several levels of the pathologic&#xD;
      cascade to antibody-mediated CHB.&#xD;
