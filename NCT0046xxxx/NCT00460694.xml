    <textblock>
      Cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) cells have been shown by our lab to be cytolytic against both&#xD;
      autologous and allogeneic acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cells. Large scale expansion of CIK&#xD;
      cells has also been shown to be feasible in healthy allogeneic stem cell donors as well as in&#xD;
      patients undergoing mobilization for autologous transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been shown to be active against some haematological&#xD;
      malignancies including CML, AML, MDS,NHL and Hodgkin's disease. These donor lymphocytes can&#xD;
      be further activated in vitro to become CIK cells. At least 2 other centers in the world have&#xD;
      given allogeneic CIK cells for patients relapsing post allogeneic transplant for a variety of&#xD;
      haematological malignancies. These early reports have demonstrated feasibility, absence of&#xD;
      increased GVHD and possible efficacy in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing a Phase I /II study on the feasibility / efficacy of immunotherapy with&#xD;
      allogeneic CIK cells for patients who relapse after allogeneic marrow transplant for their&#xD;
      haematological malignancies. These patients have to be either refractory to conventional&#xD;
      donor lymphocyte infusion, or need a larger number of donor lymphocyte than could be provided&#xD;
      by unmanipulated donor lymphocytes. Donor lymphocytes will be collected and cultured in GMP&#xD;
      facilities to maturity, then infused into patients. This will be given in graded doses at 4&#xD;
      weekly intervals and continued on in the absence of GVHD till remission is achieved or&#xD;
      disease progression occurs. Patients may receive various forms of chemotherapy appropriate to&#xD;
      the clinical condition in each case before the allogeneic CIK infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the response to allogeneic CIK infusion vs that to due&#xD;
      to conventional DLI, ie response to the two different treatment using DLI response as the&#xD;
      comparator. We expect about 10 such cases to be done over the next 3 years. Significant&#xD;
      statistics is unlikely to be generated but observation and description of the response can&#xD;
      generate useful information for presence or not of the efficacy of such a treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If clinical efficacy and superiority over conventional DLI is demonstrated, then future&#xD;
      allogeneic CIK may take the place of DLI in this group of poor prognosis patients who relapse&#xD;
      after allogeneic transplant .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Patient inclusion criteria This trial includes only patients who have relapsed after an&#xD;
           allogeneic transplant, who have either 1.1 No response to conventional DLI given for at&#xD;
           least one dose, or 1.2 No possibility of access to large number of donor lymphocyte for&#xD;
           repeated doses of DLI, This applies to cases of unrelated transplant or cord blood&#xD;
           transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
           1,3 Patients who developed significant GVHD to conventional DLI, but had no other&#xD;
           therapeutic option. In such cases the rationale is based on mice studies of mismatched&#xD;
           CIK producing much less GVHD than mismatched unmanipulated splenocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collection of peripheral blood stem cells ( PBSC ) Sibling allogeneic donors will&#xD;
           routinely have their PBSC harvested for the purpose of infusion into the recipients.&#xD;
           Currently our practice involves one additional day of collection to freeze as backup to&#xD;
           be used for DLI in the event of relapse. This collection is frozen in a few aliquots,&#xD;
           and is available for CIK culture when need arises&#xD;
&#xD;
           For cord blood transplant, one issue is that DLI is not available. There is one report&#xD;
           on growing CIK from residual cells in the bags of cord blood after infusion, then stored&#xD;
           frozen for use in future if need arises. This does not in anyway compromise the cord&#xD;
           blood infusion. Similarly this can be done in the case of unrelated donor transplant.&#xD;
           This will serve as a backup in the event that donor is not available for repeat&#xD;
           collection of lymphocyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Culture of CIK cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      For culture from frozen product, this is rapidly thawed and culture started in gas permeable&#xD;
      bags in complete medium and cytokine as detailed in SOP attached ( appendix 1 ). Culture&#xD;
      medium and cytokine are added periodically till maturation of CIK at between 21-28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For culture from residual cells in the thawed cord blood infusion bags, cells may need to&#xD;
      undergo ficoll to remove rbc, then start culture in the similar way&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Harvesting of CIK cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      At maturity between D21-D28, all bags of CIK cells are pooled and washed using COBE 2991 cell&#xD;
      harvester. This will ensure removal of &gt;99.9% of the original culture medium. Cells are then&#xD;
      frozen and aliquots sent for quality control to ensure compliance to GMP standard. This&#xD;
      includes bacteriological and fungal culture, mycoplasma and endotoxin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Infusion of CIK cells Patients may undergo cytoreductive chemotherapy or oral&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy as deemed fit in each individual case by the attending physician.&#xD;
      At the nadir of lymphopenia , CIK cells are rapidly thawed at bedside and infused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and schedule of CIK cells follows the following principle 4.1 First dose for patients&#xD;
      who have already received DLI and showed resistance : at double or triple the last DLI dose (&#xD;
      expressed as CD3/kg ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 First dose for patients who have not received any DLI : this will follow the conventional&#xD;
      practice of DLI where the first dose will be 10 million CD3/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Subsequent doses will be given at 4-weekly intervals allowing time to observe for&#xD;
      development of GVHD and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.1 If no response was observed, dose will be doubled or tripled ( depending on the size of&#xD;
      the available aliquot ). If there is good response, dose will remain the same as the previous&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.2 In the presence of GVHD, infusion will be withheld till resolution of GVHD, then&#xD;
      resumed at half or one-third of the previous dose ( depending on the size of the available&#xD;
      aliquot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Duration of CIK infusion will depending on the response status 4.4.1 In responding&#xD;
      patients, 4-weekly CIK infusion will continue till a complete remission is achieved and then&#xD;
      another 2-3 infusions beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.2 In patients who achieve a stable partial response, CIK infusion will continue in a&#xD;
      4-weekly interval, provided no adverse effect and CIK cells are available. This will continue&#xD;
      on and stop if disease breaks through.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3 In patients where disease continues to progress after 2-3 cycles of CIK infusion, no&#xD;
      further infusion will be given&#xD;
