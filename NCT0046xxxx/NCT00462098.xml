  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has recently been recognized as associated with bisphosphonate&#xD;
      therapy, however there is little information on the natural history, treatment or prevention&#xD;
      strategies for this condition. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen as a treatment. We will randomize 35 out of 70 ONJ patients to receive HBO&#xD;
      in addition to their routine oral surgery care and follow both groups over a 2-year period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has recently been recognized as associated with bisphosphonate&#xD;
      (BP) therapy, however there is little information on the natural history, treatment or&#xD;
      prevention strategies for this condition1. Bisphosphonates, particularly compounds containing&#xD;
      an aliphatic chain with an amino group in the R2 position, (pamidronate, alendronate and&#xD;
      zoledronate) are extremely effective and widely used in the treatment of breast cancer,&#xD;
      prostate cancer, multiple myeloma and non-malignant bone disease. Although ONJ appears to&#xD;
      develop in less than one percent of patients taking these drugs, the seriousness of the&#xD;
      disease plus the current lack of treatment options makes this a very difficult clinical&#xD;
      problem This study will randomize 35 out of 70 patients to receive HBO in addition to their&#xD;
      routine oral surgery therapy for ONJ and follow both groups over a 2-year period. The study&#xD;
      design is an interventional, prospective, randomized trial with a 2-year follow up period.&#xD;
      Seventy subjects meeting the inclusion criteria for ONJ will be recruited by participating&#xD;
      physicians and randomized to receive 40 HBO treatments over a 4 week period or to continue&#xD;
      their normal oral care. No subject, HBO treated or not, will be asked to change, initiate or&#xD;
      discontinue any ongoing therapies they may be receiving from their primary care giver for ONJ&#xD;
      or any other medical condition. The analysis will compare remission rates between the two&#xD;
      groups while controlling for age, gender, race, previous local trauma or surgery, tumor type,&#xD;
      diabetes, immunosuppression, bisphosphonate duration, indication (hypercalcemia), infection,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, and thalidomide and dental hygiene. All subjects will be closely followed&#xD;
      throughout the 24 month course of the study with weekly contacts by phone or email to log jaw&#xD;
      pain level as well as to record any change in general medical condition. The 17 question Duke&#xD;
      Health Profile will be used to measure quality of life indicators at 4 key points during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison(s): 1) clinical remission rate in patients receiving and not receiving HBO. 2)&#xD;
      Bone turnover and molecular measures of osteoclast signaling in ONJ patients before and after&#xD;
      HBO and relative to non-diseased controls (labs from non-diseased controls to be obtained&#xD;
      from a companion study).&#xD;
