  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the immune response as well as the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of an H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population. Further, the&#xD;
      study will assess the need for a booster vaccination and whether a 6-month booster or a&#xD;
      12-month booster is more appropriate. An independent data safety monitoring board will review&#xD;
      and evaluate the safety data obtained in this study on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
