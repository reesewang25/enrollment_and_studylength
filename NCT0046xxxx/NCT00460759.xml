  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics (how a drug is absorbed,&#xD;
      distributed, and eliminated by the body) of moxifloxacin alone versus moxifloxacin given with&#xD;
      rifapentine. Researchers believe that understanding how these tuberculosis drugs interact&#xD;
      when given together may help to determine the best drug treatment plan for use in future&#xD;
      studies. Volunteers will take moxifloxacin daily by mouth for the first part of the study and&#xD;
      then moxifloxacin in combination with rifapentine during the second part of the study.&#xD;
      Sixteen healthy men and women will be recruited from Johns Hopkins University School of&#xD;
      Medicine to volunteer for this study. They will be required to stay in the inpatient unit&#xD;
      twice, each time for 84 hours. Study procedures will include having a tube placed in a vein&#xD;
      to draw several blood samples over time. Volunteers will participate in the study for a&#xD;
      maximum of 48 days, including screening and follow-up visits.&#xD;

      New drugs are urgently needed to shorten the duration of tuberculosis (TB) treatment and to&#xD;
      facilitate the delivery of directly observed therapy. Preliminary data indicates that a TB&#xD;
      treatment regimen that includes moxifloxacin plus rifapentine may have excellent&#xD;
      antituberculosis activity that could allow for shortening of total TB treatment duration.&#xD;
      However, little is known about possible pharmacokinetic interactions between the two drugs in&#xD;
      humans. More specifically, moxifloxacin is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate&#xD;
      conjugation to inactive metabolites. Given that rifapentine induces the activity of phase II&#xD;
      enzymes including glucuronosyltransferase and sulphotransferase, it is possible that&#xD;
      rifapentine may alter the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin. This study will be a prospective,&#xD;
      phase I, single center pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects. The trial will compare the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin alone versus moxifloxacin administered with thrice-weekly&#xD;
      rifapentine, each administered orally. There will be two parts to the trial: Part I (Days&#xD;
      1-4) during which moxifloxacin is administered alone; and Part II (Days 5-19) during which&#xD;
      moxifloxacin is co-administered with thrice-weekly rifapentine. A 24-hour pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile of moxifloxacin will be obtained following dose administration of moxifloxacin on Day&#xD;
      4 to obtain baseline steady state data at a dose of 400 mg daily. On Day 5, rifapentine will&#xD;
      be added to the regimen at a dose of 900 mg thrice weekly, and a 48-hour pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile for rifapentine and its metabolite, 25-desacetyl-rifapentine will be obtained after&#xD;
      the first dose. On Day 19, 72-hour pharmacokinetic profiles for moxifloxacin, rifapentine,&#xD;
      and 25-desacetyl-rifapentine will be performed. Safety and tolerability assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at designated intervals throughout the study. Beginning on Day 1, subjects will&#xD;
      receive moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 19 days (Days 1-19). Beginning on Day 5, subjects will&#xD;
      also receive rifapentine 900 mg thrice weekly (to be administered on Days 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16&#xD;
      and 19). Study participants will be 16 healthy adults, ages 18-65, recruited through Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins University School of Medicine. The primary study objectives are to: compare, in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin alone versus moxifloxacin&#xD;
      co-administered with thrice-weekly rifapentine and describe the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      moxifloxacin co-administered with rifapentine. The secondary study objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      for rifapentine autoinduction of metabolism in healthy volunteers receiving thrice-weekly&#xD;
      rifapentine. The primary safety outcome will be the proportion of subjects with any Grade 3&#xD;
      or 4 toxicity associated with study medications or any serious adverse event. The secondary&#xD;
      safety outcomes will be the proportion of subjects with any Grade 1 or 2 toxicity associated&#xD;
      with study medications, and the proportion of subjects discontinuing study medications for&#xD;
      any reason.&#xD;
