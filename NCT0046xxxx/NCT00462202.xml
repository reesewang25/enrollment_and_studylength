  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of KRX-101 in treating&#xD;
      persistent microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients who are also being treated with&#xD;
      stable, maximum tolerated doses of either ACE inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is one of the most common causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the U.S. and&#xD;
      in many other developed nations. Despite advances in clinical care, including improvements in&#xD;
      glycemic and blood pressure control, the number of new cases of diabetes-related ESRD&#xD;
      continues to rise, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for the prevention and treatment of diabetic renal disease&#xD;
      includes screening all diabetic patients for microalbuminuria. Patients who test positive for&#xD;
      microalbuminuria are then treated with either ACE inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers. Both of&#xD;
      these classes of medication have been shown to reduce levels of microalbuminuria in some&#xD;
      patient populations. This improvement in microalbuminuria has also shown a delay of&#xD;
      progression to a number of other renal function problems, as well as a minimal delay in&#xD;
      certain clinical events including ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, some patients achieve the majority of their therapeutic effect of ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers within the first 6 months of therapy, and many of these&#xD;
      patients continue to show persistent microalbuminuria. Therefore, these patients are at an&#xD;
      increased risk of progressing to ESRD due to the lack of adequate benefit from their current&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microalbuminuria has a straight-line relationship with adverse renal outcomes; therefore any&#xD;
      level of reduction may have clinical benefit. It is reasonable to believe that patients who&#xD;
      can reduce or have a complete remission of their microalbuminuria may also lessen the risk of&#xD;
      progressing to ESRD. Thus, if KRX-101 is able to cause a reduction or complete remission of&#xD;
      microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria, patients may receive a significant clinical benefit.&#xD;
